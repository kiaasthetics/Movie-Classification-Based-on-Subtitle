1
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:24,011
Let's play some hockey!

2
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,918
This is Joy, coming to you
live in Riley's mind,

3
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:36,754
and we are expecting
a great championship today

4
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:38,623
<i>with the Foghorns.</i>

5
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,731
Riley fans,
get up on your feet,

6
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:43,931
and make some noise!

7
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:45,270
Go, go, go!

8
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:48,272
Let's go, Foghorns!

9
00:01:48,873 --> 00:01:49,873
Bring it in!

10
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:51,109
Foghorns on three.

11
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:53,040
- One, two, three...
- Foghorns!

12
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:06,087
Now, it's time to greet
your Team Riley!

13
00:02:06,223 --> 00:02:07,683
Playing in his 13th year,

14
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:09,551
and fresh from
the penalty box,

15
00:02:09,687 --> 00:02:11,554
it's Riley's Anger!

16
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:13,497
Let me at 'em!

17
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,501
Whoo!

18
00:02:21,138 --> 00:02:22,632
Helmet, pads, gloves,

19
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,903
safety checklist is complete.

20
00:02:25,038 --> 00:02:26,909
It should be nothing
but smooth sailing from...

21
00:02:27,045 --> 00:02:28,679
Look out!

22
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:32,082
And that's Fear,
keeping Riley on her toes.

23
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,615
We gotta get
our mouth guard, people.

24
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,989
No, no, no! That's not ours!

25
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:39,488
And that, folks,

26
00:02:39,624 --> 00:02:41,618
is the infamous Disgust.

27
00:02:41,754 --> 00:02:43,228
Glad to have her on our team.

28
00:02:45,463 --> 00:02:47,431
Twenty-eight.
Andersen, tripping.

29
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:49,044
<i>Oh, no...</i>

30
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,660
And bringing up the rear,

31
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,462
you know her, you love her,

32
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:54,398
the one, the only...

33
00:02:54,534 --> 00:02:57,174
Oh... We got a penalty.

34
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,547
That's right,

35
00:02:58,571 --> 00:03:00,611
Sadness is in the house!

36
00:03:00,746 --> 00:03:01,873
Yay...

37
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:03,739
<i>Andersen goes to the box.</i>

38
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,242
<i>Two minutes for tripping.</i>

39
00:03:05,377 --> 00:03:07,019
<i>Okay, looks like
we have a couple of minutes</i>

40
00:03:07,043 --> 00:03:08,853
<i>while Riley takes a breather.</i>

41
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,252
<i>Let me catch you up.</i>

42
00:03:10,387 --> 00:03:12,888
<i>Riley is still exceptional.</i>

43
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,217
Ta-da!

44
00:03:14,353 --> 00:03:15,558
Oh. Yum.

45
00:03:15,693 --> 00:03:16,933
<i>And not just because
she's the top</i>

46
00:03:16,957 --> 00:03:18,132
<i>- of her class...
- Riley Andersen.</i>

47
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,555
<i>...which, by the way, she is.</i>

48
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:20,966
Riley, Riley, over here!

49
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,529
<i>She's also really kind,</i>

50
00:03:23,664 --> 00:03:25,693
<i>and she's nice to stray cats.</i>

51
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,070
<i>I mean, come on.</i>

52
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:28,405
<i>Oh, and she's officially</i>

53
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,012
<i>a teenager now.</i>

54
00:03:30,036 --> 00:03:32,076
<i>She got very tall, very fast.</i>

55
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,873
<i>Did we grow overnight?</i>

56
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:36,547
<i>Oh.
That was our favorite shirt.</i>

57
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:40,185
<i>We even got braces
with extra rubber bands!</i>

58
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,986
- How does it feel?
- Great!

59
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,288
- Ow!
- Sorry.

60
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,450
<i>Riley's
Personality Islands</i>

61
00:03:45,586 --> 00:03:47,150
<i>are still going strong.</i>

62
00:03:47,285 --> 00:03:49,889
Glad to see Boy Band Island
finally broke up.

63
00:03:50,024 --> 00:03:52,821
But Goofball is still
monkeying around.

64
00:03:52,956 --> 00:03:54,557
Wait, where's Family Island?

65
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,235
It's right there.

66
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,067
Oh, there it is.

67
00:03:59,203 --> 00:04:01,096
What's that blocking it?

68
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:02,664
Oh, that's Friendship Island.

69
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,042
Isn't it amazing?

70
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,036
<i>But we realized her islands</i>

71
00:04:06,171 --> 00:04:08,640
<i>aren't the only things
made by memories.</i>

72
00:04:08,775 --> 00:04:10,338
<i>Way down, at the root level,</i>

73
00:04:10,474 --> 00:04:13,847
<i>these memories
were also creating beliefs.</i>

74
00:04:13,982 --> 00:04:15,852
<i>Homework should be illegal.</i>

75
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,291
<i>Get Up and Glow
is the best band ever!</i>

76
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,294
<i>And my personal favorite...</i>

77
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,029
<i>I'm a really good friend.</i>

78
00:04:24,154 --> 00:04:26,856
Did you know
the change in your couch

79
00:04:26,991 --> 00:04:28,894
could change the world?
Oh, no!

80
00:04:33,404 --> 00:04:34,866
Oh, no,
we should do something.

81
00:04:35,002 --> 00:04:36,902
No!
That girl is a social <i>Titanic.</i>

82
00:04:37,037 --> 00:04:38,675
- Do not get on that ship.
- Uh...

83
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,169
Guys...

84
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:41,911
Wow.

85
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,443
That is so pretty.

86
00:04:48,312 --> 00:04:51,554
It's okay.
I drop things all the time.

87
00:04:55,521 --> 00:04:56,724
I'm Riley.

88
00:04:57,424 --> 00:04:58,660
I'm Grace.

89
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:00,629
I'm Bree.

90
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:03,512
<i>Turns out, when you put</i>

91
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:04,766
<i>all of those
beliefs together,</i>

92
00:05:04,902 --> 00:05:07,103
<i>they make the most wonderful
thing of all.</i>

93
00:05:07,238 --> 00:05:09,064
<i>Her Sense of Self.</i>

94
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,674
<i>I'm a good person.</i>

95
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,277
<i>It's what helps Riley
make good choices.</i>

96
00:05:14,412 --> 00:05:16,110
<i>Thirteen years of hard work,</i>

97
00:05:16,245 --> 00:05:20,481
<i>all wrapped up in what some
might call our masterpiece.</i>

98
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:21,736
<i>You know, one of the hardest</i>

99
00:05:21,818 --> 00:05:23,093
<i>challenges we found...</i>

100
00:05:23,117 --> 00:05:24,081
<i>Oh, my gosh!
We're back in the game.</i>

101
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:26,620
<i>We're tied.</i>

102
00:05:26,755 --> 00:05:27,955
How are we gonna score
in time?

103
00:05:28,022 --> 00:05:29,293
<i>Oh!
We use our slap shot!</i>

104
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,524
No, no, no.
We charge the goalie!

105
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:33,728
But Grace hasn't scored yet.

106
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,127
Riley's got this.

107
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:42,000
Thread the needle!

108
00:05:43,437 --> 00:05:44,541
Come on, Riley.

109
00:06:07,057 --> 00:06:08,899
Awooga!

110
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,335
Awooga!

111
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,870
Yeah,
that's what I'm talking about!

112
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,701
Look at that! That's my girl!

113
00:06:13,837 --> 00:06:15,008
<i>And the Foghorns</i>

114
00:06:15,032 --> 00:06:16,632
<i>win the championship!</i>

115
00:06:22,176 --> 00:06:24,016
- She shoots and she scores!
- Champions, baby!

116
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,117
Hey, girls.

117
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,980
Congratulations on your win.

118
00:06:27,115 --> 00:06:29,612
That's the high school coach!

119
00:06:29,747 --> 00:06:31,088
What a game!

120
00:06:31,223 --> 00:06:32,883
That last play? Whoo!

121
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,960
The three of you
were impressive.

122
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:36,455
Thanks, Coach Roberts.

123
00:06:36,591 --> 00:06:37,760
Look, it's last minute,

124
00:06:37,895 --> 00:06:40,795
but every year,
I do a three-day skills camp.

125
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,795
I invite all the best players
in the area.

126
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,031
I'd love
for you girls to come.

127
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,929
Are we in a dream right now?

128
00:06:47,065 --> 00:06:48,629
Please, can somebody pinch me?

129
00:06:48,765 --> 00:06:49,765
Ow!

130
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:50,865
Definitely awake.

131
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:52,203
If we impress Coach,

132
00:06:52,338 --> 00:06:54,189
she'll put the three of us
on the team next year.

133
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,906
Ooh! The Fire Hawks!

134
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,740
Finally,
a team I can get behind.

135
00:06:58,875 --> 00:06:59,941
What do you say?

136
00:07:00,076 --> 00:07:01,076
- Yes!
- Absolutely yes.

137
00:07:01,145 --> 00:07:02,185
- We're there!
- Thank you,

138
00:07:02,312 --> 00:07:03,552
- thank you, thank you!
- Great.

139
00:07:03,618 --> 00:07:05,022
We'll see you tomorrow.

140
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,649
Ah! This is amazing!

141
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:13,889
What a big day!

142
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:15,323
You are such an all-star!

143
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,830
You are gonna knock
the coach's skates off!

144
00:07:17,966 --> 00:07:20,234
Hockey scholarship,
here we come!

145
00:07:20,369 --> 00:07:21,239
Dad, stop.

146
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,902
It's just hockey camp.

147
00:07:23,037 --> 00:07:25,334
I mean,
who knows what'll happen?

148
00:07:28,077 --> 00:07:29,921
<i>Twenty-eight. Andersen,</i>

149
00:07:29,945 --> 00:07:31,154
<i>tripping.</i>

150
00:07:31,178 --> 00:07:33,848
My penalty almost lost us
the game today.

151
00:07:33,983 --> 00:07:35,911
What if I get to camp
and I screw it up?

152
00:07:36,047 --> 00:07:37,311
Hey, don't talk like that.

153
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:39,684
Yeah,
you did great today, honey.

154
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:41,959
Exactly. Mom gets it.

155
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,622
Yeah, I guess.

156
00:07:43,757 --> 00:07:45,396
We're so proud of you.

157
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,225
Night, monkey.

158
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:48,969
All right, all right.

159
00:07:48,993 --> 00:07:50,330
Sleep tight, honey.

160
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,706
Oh, Riley's so hard
on herself.

161
00:07:58,842 --> 00:08:01,007
But we can make
everything easier.

162
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:04,746
Behold, my super high-tech

163
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:07,277
Riley protection system.

164
00:08:08,551 --> 00:08:09,682
Don't look, it's fine.

165
00:08:09,818 --> 00:08:11,322
This is for all those memories

166
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,619
that belong
in the Back of the Mind,

167
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:15,220
like this penalty one.

168
00:08:15,355 --> 00:08:18,095
It's weighing on her,
so let's lighten the load.

169
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,060
A one-way expressway to,

170
00:08:20,196 --> 00:08:23,095
"We're not gonna think
about that right now." Whoo!

171
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,112
- Not bad.
- Oh, Joy.

172
00:08:27,136 --> 00:08:28,208
- That's pretty impressive.
- You worked hard.

173
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:30,469
You take such good care
of Riley.

174
00:08:30,605 --> 00:08:31,999
Thanks, I try.

175
00:08:32,135 --> 00:08:34,104
Okay, let's do a sweep.

176
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:35,876
Oh, here's one
where she waved at a guy

177
00:08:36,012 --> 00:08:38,075
who was actually waving
at a girl behind her.

178
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:40,244
Oh, that was so bad.
Good choice.

179
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,013
Oh, here's when she forgot
that girl's name.

180
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,428
Oh, yeah,
that was super awkward.

181
00:08:44,454 --> 00:08:45,454
What was her name?

182
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,839
I don't know,
Janet or something?

183
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,627
Whatever. Let's just
get rid of it. Oh!

184
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:52,789
We keep the best
and toss the rest.

185
00:08:52,925 --> 00:08:54,263
Nice work, everyone.

186
00:08:54,398 --> 00:08:55,398
All right, Anger,

187
00:08:55,525 --> 00:08:57,285
the rest of these babies
can go to long-term.

188
00:09:04,037 --> 00:09:05,967
Oh, okay.
Let's get some shut-eye.

189
00:09:06,102 --> 00:09:07,678
Big day tomorrow.

190
00:09:14,485 --> 00:09:16,344
Joy, are you taking that

191
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,983
where I think
you're taking that?

192
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:21,421
- Wanna come this time?
- Yes.

193
00:09:21,556 --> 00:09:22,556
I mean no. I...

194
00:09:22,626 --> 00:09:24,922
Oh, no. I really shouldn't.

195
00:09:25,058 --> 00:09:26,218
You know, you're the only one

196
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,958
who hasn't been
to the Belief System.

197
00:09:28,094 --> 00:09:29,599
Yeah, it's just that it's new,

198
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:31,460
and I know
how important it is.

199
00:09:31,595 --> 00:09:34,735
And I don't wanna mess it up
or break it,

200
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:37,102
or burn it to the ground
or anything.

201
00:09:37,238 --> 00:09:39,775
Sadness, you won't hurt it,
I promise.

202
00:09:39,911 --> 00:09:41,475
Have I ever
steered you wrong before?

203
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,441
Yeah, many times.

204
00:09:43,577 --> 00:09:44,577
Come on.

205
00:09:45,912 --> 00:09:48,279
Where I go, you go.

206
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,372
Oh, my goodness.

207
00:10:34,562 --> 00:10:36,261
Whoa!

208
00:10:47,874 --> 00:10:49,623
<i>Mom and Dad
are proud of me.</i>

209
00:10:49,647 --> 00:10:51,309
Ah! An oldie but a goodie.

210
00:10:53,381 --> 00:10:54,981
<i>I'm kind.</i>

211
00:10:55,012 --> 00:10:57,183
Aw. That's nice.

212
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,083
<i>I'm strong. I'm brave.</i>

213
00:11:00,219 --> 00:11:01,720
<i>I'm a really good friend.</i>

214
00:11:20,008 --> 00:11:21,274
<i>I'm a winner.</i>

215
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,809
<i>And all those beliefs
come together</i>

216
00:11:23,944 --> 00:11:26,175
<i>to make our Riley.</i>

217
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,049
<i>I'm a good person.</i>

218
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,502
Huh?

219
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,604
What the heck is that?

220
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,393
Turn that off, Joy!

221
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,136
People,
it's the apocalypse!

222
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:21,198
No!

223
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,565
What are you doing?

224
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,370
Um...

225
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:35,648
Whoo!

226
00:12:35,783 --> 00:12:37,351
Problem solved.

227
00:12:37,487 --> 00:12:38,487
Joy.

228
00:12:43,355 --> 00:12:45,323
Okay, let's clear it all out.

229
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,228
It's demo day.

230
00:12:49,665 --> 00:12:50,666
Demo?

231
00:12:50,802 --> 00:12:52,269
Wait, wait, what's happening?

232
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:53,802
What's going on?

233
00:12:53,938 --> 00:12:55,973
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

234
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,271
Who are you people?

235
00:13:02,213 --> 00:13:04,747
Hey, are you the one
in charge here?

236
00:13:04,882 --> 00:13:06,122
Could you do me
a favor and stop

237
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:07,650
tearing Headquarters apart?

238
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:08,947
No can do. Didn't you hear?

239
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,321
Permits just came through.

240
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,817
Permits? For what?

241
00:13:11,953 --> 00:13:13,380
For expanding the place.

242
00:13:13,516 --> 00:13:14,791
You know, for the others.

243
00:13:15,988 --> 00:13:16,991
What others?

244
00:13:17,127 --> 00:13:19,158
They're not here yet?
Aye, yi, yi.

245
00:13:19,294 --> 00:13:21,061
Hey, Margie,
you got that console?

246
00:13:21,197 --> 00:13:22,863
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Give me a sec!

247
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:24,159
Hey, hey! What are you doing?

248
00:13:24,234 --> 00:13:25,999
- All right. She's all set.
- Set with what?

249
00:13:26,134 --> 00:13:27,637
<i>Come on, Riley. Get up.</i>

250
00:13:27,772 --> 00:13:29,471
Camp time.

251
00:13:29,606 --> 00:13:31,001
Lunch break!

252
00:13:32,374 --> 00:13:33,974
Wait, wait!
You can't leave it like this.

253
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:35,308
Don't worry, we'll be back.

254
00:13:35,443 --> 00:13:36,812
<i>Come on.
We're gonna be late.</i>

255
00:13:36,948 --> 00:13:38,645
- Oh, no, no, no!
<i>- Let's go!</i>

256
00:13:41,314 --> 00:13:43,679
Riley, you aren't packed yet?

257
00:13:44,756 --> 00:13:46,925
Ugh! You're always on me!

258
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,723
Can't you just lay off for,
like, one second?

259
00:13:49,859 --> 00:13:51,527
Uh, overreact much?

260
00:13:51,663 --> 00:13:52,895
I barely touched it.

261
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,926
Those morons
broke the console.

262
00:13:55,062 --> 00:13:56,834
Riley, what's wrong?

263
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,303
Oh, Mom looks sad.

264
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,266
I'm the worst!

265
00:14:01,402 --> 00:14:03,066
Oh, no. Honey.

266
00:14:03,202 --> 00:14:04,672
I barely touched it.

267
00:14:04,808 --> 00:14:05,837
That's what I said.

268
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,708
Let the professional
handle this.

269
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:18,920
I'm too gross to go to camp
or anywhere ever again!

270
00:14:19,055 --> 00:14:20,618
Oh, yeah,
this is totally broken.

271
00:14:21,588 --> 00:14:23,622
Well, we all knew
this day would come.

272
00:14:23,758 --> 00:14:26,326
Remember, we agreed not to
make a big deal about this.

273
00:14:26,461 --> 00:14:28,037
But she really does stink.

274
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:29,164
Oh, it's bad.

275
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:32,030
Remain calm.
Stick to the prepared script.

276
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,571
You are not gross, honey.

277
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:36,730
You're just changing.

278
00:14:36,866 --> 00:14:38,202
Remember that
beautiful butterfly

279
00:14:38,338 --> 00:14:39,968
we saw in the park last week?

280
00:14:40,104 --> 00:14:41,655
<i>Well, that butterfly
began as a caterpillar.</i>

281
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,871
Easy...

282
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:43,876
<i>And just like
that caterpillar...</i>

283
00:14:43,877 --> 00:14:44,983
Easy...

284
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,425
<i>...you're about to
get your wings.</i>

285
00:14:46,449 --> 00:14:48,057
- But if you have questions...
- Oh, my gosh, Mom!

286
00:14:48,081 --> 00:14:50,845
Just go away! Ugh!

287
00:14:50,981 --> 00:14:54,515
Well, that's a preview
of the next 10 years.

288
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:56,027
- Riley!
- Oh, my gosh!

289
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:57,266
- We're gonna have so much fun!
- All right.

290
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,463
Who's ready for hockey camp?

291
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:00,657
Oh, yeah!

292
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:02,277
<i>Okay, until we can
figure this out,</i>

293
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,233
nobody touch the console
unless you really need to.

294
00:15:06,534 --> 00:15:09,237
So, big weekend for us.
What do you wanna do?

295
00:15:09,373 --> 00:15:11,093
Well, we could finally
clean out the garage.

296
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,942
Or, actually,
we can get upstairs...

297
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,070
How great
is next year gonna be?

298
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,816
Coach Roberts' team has been
state champs like every year.

299
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:22,185
And Val Ortiz
is the captain now.

300
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,289
This Valentina Ortiz obsession
is outta control.

301
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,019
Uh, she made the Fire Hawks
when she was only a freshman.

302
00:15:28,155 --> 00:15:29,885
That's really hard.

303
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,054
All we have to do
is be super awesome at camp,

304
00:15:32,189 --> 00:15:36,758
Coach will put us on the team,
and we'll all be Fire Hawks!

305
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,414
- Wait, what was that?
- What was what?

306
00:15:38,466 --> 00:15:40,571
We got a look.
I don't like this.

307
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:41,835
What? You're paranoid.

308
00:15:41,971 --> 00:15:43,304
I never miss a look.

309
00:15:46,274 --> 00:15:48,007
Enhance 224... 176.

310
00:15:48,142 --> 00:15:50,238
Track right. Zoom in.

311
00:15:50,373 --> 00:15:52,210
Right there!

312
00:15:52,345 --> 00:15:54,517
- So?
- She's hiding something.

313
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:56,053
But what?

314
00:15:58,591 --> 00:15:59,591
What is she doing?

315
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:00,856
She's looking at our look!

316
00:16:00,992 --> 00:16:03,753
No, it's much more than that.

317
00:16:06,227 --> 00:16:07,454
She looks the same to me.

318
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,825
Overlay and compare.

319
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:12,465
See? Riley then, Riley now.
Riley then, Riley now.

320
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,429
Oh, It's so obvious!

321
00:16:14,564 --> 00:16:16,103
But what does it mean?

322
00:16:16,238 --> 00:16:18,471
She knows
we're hiding something.

323
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,503
What is happening right now?

324
00:16:21,638 --> 00:16:22,684
I don't know! I don't know!

325
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,713
- I can't take this anymore!
- Ah!

326
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:26,447
You spilled the tea!

327
00:16:26,582 --> 00:16:28,517
Coach Roberts isn't gonna be
our coach next year.

328
00:16:28,652 --> 00:16:29,652
Grace!

329
00:16:32,015 --> 00:16:34,755
We... We got assigned to
a different high school.

330
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,126
A-ha! Oh...

331
00:16:36,693 --> 00:16:38,219
Oh, no.

332
00:16:38,354 --> 00:16:39,397
Oh...

333
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:40,597
Okay. Um...

334
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:42,231
Yeah. No big deal.

335
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:44,525
- This is a huge deal!
- Our life is over!

336
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:45,736
Is she serious right now?

337
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,128
How long have they known this?

338
00:16:47,263 --> 00:16:48,447
- I can't breathe.
- We can't go to high school

339
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:50,346
- without Bree and Grace.
- We won't know anybody.

340
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,742
We'll still get to hang out.

341
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,305
And we'll have this weekend,

342
00:16:53,441 --> 00:16:55,107
which means
we'll get one last time

343
00:16:55,243 --> 00:16:56,538
playing on the same team.

344
00:16:56,673 --> 00:16:58,511
Friends are forever, right?

345
00:16:59,376 --> 00:17:01,419
Yeah. Of course.

346
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:02,554
Whoo!

347
00:17:02,616 --> 00:17:03,919
I can't wait
to get to the rink.

348
00:17:04,055 --> 00:17:05,200
When do we get our schedules?

349
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,514
I heard our room has a view...

350
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,560
Oh, this is so sad.

351
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,085
No, wait, Sadness!

352
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,572
- No, no, no! Don't!
- I don't have a good grip!

353
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:14,758
Just keep it together
until we're out of the car.

354
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:17,392
Here we are.

355
00:17:17,528 --> 00:17:19,500
This looks really cool.

356
00:17:19,635 --> 00:17:21,475
Are you sure you don't need
an assistant coach?

357
00:17:21,532 --> 00:17:22,532
'Cause I am available.

358
00:17:22,636 --> 00:17:23,978
- Bill.
- No? All right.

359
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,519
- We'll see you in a few days.
- Have fun!

360
00:17:25,543 --> 00:17:26,878
- Thanks so much. Bye!
- Don't miss us too much.

361
00:17:26,902 --> 00:17:28,638
- Okay, bye!
- Wait. Riley,

362
00:17:28,774 --> 00:17:30,054
are you sure
you have everything?

363
00:17:30,144 --> 00:17:31,240
- Stick?
- Yes.

364
00:17:31,376 --> 00:17:32,412
- Gloves?
- Yes.

365
00:17:32,548 --> 00:17:33,656
- You have your phone?
- Yes, of course.

366
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,345
- Fully charged?
- Yeah, it's like 50.

367
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
- What?
- Dad, it's fine.

368
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:37,984
Okay, call us if you need us.

369
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,120
I love you. Go get 'em.

370
00:17:39,187 --> 00:17:40,221
Okay. Love you guys.

371
00:17:40,357 --> 00:17:42,823
- Don't forget the deodorant!
- Mom!

372
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,161
Bye, monkey.

373
00:17:46,423 --> 00:17:48,693
Okay, now.

374
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:56,206
It's okay. We need this.

375
00:18:01,743 --> 00:18:03,672
<i>Guys,
these are high-schoolers.</i>

376
00:18:03,807 --> 00:18:04,859
- Oh...
- We do not wanna be

377
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:05,883
red and puffy, do we?

378
00:18:05,947 --> 00:18:06,974
No.

379
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,678
Don't worry,
we'll have plenty of time

380
00:18:08,814 --> 00:18:10,385
to think about this
after camp.

381
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,055
<i>Now, where did
Bree and Grace go?</i>

382
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,651
- Oh! There they are.
- Wait.

383
00:18:14,787 --> 00:18:16,719
Aren't those traitors
dead to us?

384
00:18:16,854 --> 00:18:18,624
Our best friends?
No.

385
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,166
Whoa! Hey!

386
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:24,500
Are you okay?

387
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:27,035
Everybody act regular.
It's Valentina Ortiz.

388
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,738
- Ah!
- We gotta say something.

389
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,906
- Uh...
- Hey.

390
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:32,205
- Hi. I'm Val...
- I know.

391
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,420
You're the varsity captain,

392
00:18:33,476 --> 00:18:35,181
you set the all-time
goal record as a junior,

393
00:18:35,205 --> 00:18:36,649
your favorite color's red,
and your skates...

394
00:18:36,673 --> 00:18:37,673
What are we saying?

395
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,916
We are so uncool.

396
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,877
Why are we
still holding her hand?

397
00:18:41,012 --> 00:18:42,680
Just like me.

398
00:18:42,816 --> 00:18:44,679
Oh, you're the one
Coach told us about.

399
00:18:44,814 --> 00:18:46,618
Riley, from Michigan, right?

400
00:18:46,754 --> 00:18:48,266
- It's Minnesota, sweetie.
- No, no, no.

401
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,860
We cannot correct Val Ortiz.

402
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:53,127
Yeah, that's me.

403
00:18:53,263 --> 00:18:56,364
Riley from good old Michigan.

404
00:18:56,499 --> 00:18:58,432
Orange?
Who made the console orange?

405
00:18:58,568 --> 00:19:00,234
- Do I look orange?
- I didn't touch it.

406
00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:02,369
- Orange is not my color.
- Not me.

407
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:04,836
Hello, everybody.

408
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:07,245
Oh, my gosh. I am just
such a huge fan of yours.

409
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,311
And now, here I am,
meeting you, face to face.

410
00:19:10,447 --> 00:19:12,215
Okay. How can I help?

411
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,658
- Uh...
- I can take notes,

412
00:19:13,682 --> 00:19:15,329
get coffee, manage your
calendar, walk your dog,

413
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:16,946
carry your things,
watch you sleep.

414
00:19:17,081 --> 00:19:20,014
Wow! You have a lot of energy.

415
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,670
Maybe you could just
stay in one place.

416
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:22,853
Anything.

417
00:19:22,988 --> 00:19:24,588
Just call my name,
and I am here for you.

418
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:25,697
Okay, love that.

419
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:27,132
- And what was your name again?
- Oh.

420
00:19:27,156 --> 00:19:28,665
I'm sorry.
I can get ahead of myself.

421
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
I'm Anxiety.

422
00:19:29,862 --> 00:19:31,102
I'm one of
Riley's new emotions.

423
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:33,529
And we are just
super-jazzed to be here.

424
00:19:33,665 --> 00:19:34,764
Where can I put my stuff?

425
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,173
Uh-uh-uh.
What do you mean "we"?

426
00:19:37,808 --> 00:19:40,014
I wish I was as
tall as all of you.

427
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:42,272
Who the heck are you?

428
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:43,539
I'm Envy.

429
00:19:43,674 --> 00:19:45,742
Oh! Look at your hair.

430
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:47,751
Oh, yeah, not happening.

431
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,082
Look at her hair!

432
00:19:49,218 --> 00:19:51,222
We need hair like that.

433
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,824
Oh, my gosh.
I love the red in your hair.

434
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,022
Oh...

435
00:19:55,158 --> 00:19:57,061
What are you doing?

436
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,929
Hey,
maybe when I make the team,

437
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,631
I can join Team Redhead, too!

438
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:01,766
Yeah, yeah.

439
00:20:05,531 --> 00:20:06,794
Okay, who's this guy?

440
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:08,696
What's your name, big fella?

441
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,932
That's Embarrassment.

442
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:11,534
He's not really big
on eye contact,

443
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,207
or uh, like, good talking,

444
00:20:13,342 --> 00:20:14,542
but he's a really sweet guy.

445
00:20:14,678 --> 00:20:18,078
Well, welcome to Headquarters,
Embarrassment.

446
00:20:18,214 --> 00:20:19,915
Oh, we're doing a... No.

447
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:21,616
No, going high. Oh.

448
00:20:21,752 --> 00:20:23,887
You got a real sweaty palm
there, buddy.

449
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:26,917
Hey, do you wanna
come with me, actually?

450
00:20:27,052 --> 00:20:28,337
You can meet some of
the other Fire Hawks.

451
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:29,536
<i>Ooh,
this is exciting.</i>

452
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,021
But we can't let her know
we're excited.

453
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,897
Yeah, sounds good.

454
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,391
What emotion was that?

455
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:36,660
That's Ennui.

456
00:20:36,795 --> 00:20:38,536
An-what?

457
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:39,828
Ennui.

458
00:20:39,964 --> 00:20:42,533
It's what you would call
the boredom.

459
00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:45,007
Well, come on up here, An-wer.

460
00:20:45,142 --> 00:20:46,468
Am I saying it right?

461
00:20:46,603 --> 00:20:47,872
An-wah. No.

462
00:20:48,007 --> 00:20:50,173
Oh, nicknames!
I'm gonna call you Wee-Wee.

463
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:51,381
No.

464
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,115
How are you driving?

465
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:54,952
Console app.

466
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,846
Hey! Stop it! That's enough.

467
00:20:56,981 --> 00:20:58,948
Now, now,
I know new emotions

468
00:20:59,084 --> 00:21:01,851
can sometimes feel
unhelpful at first,

469
00:21:01,987 --> 00:21:03,854
and you just wanna...

470
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,354
say to them,
"Why are you so annoying?"

471
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:11,191
But I've learned that every
emotion is good for Riley.

472
00:21:11,327 --> 00:21:13,231
Even this turkey.

473
00:21:13,366 --> 00:21:14,804
Okay, fine.

474
00:21:16,206 --> 00:21:17,275
Cool. Lead the way.

475
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,366
All right. Grab your stuff
and follow me.

476
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:21,407
<i>Oh, but what about
our friends?</i>

477
00:21:21,542 --> 00:21:23,077
<i>Val is our future.</i>

478
00:21:23,213 --> 00:21:24,641
Yes, I agree completely.

479
00:21:24,776 --> 00:21:25,856
We need new friends or else

480
00:21:25,979 --> 00:21:27,952
we'll be totally alone
in high school.

481
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:29,087
- Right, Joy?
- Well...

482
00:21:29,212 --> 00:21:30,612
- I mean, maybe, um...
- Here we go!

483
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,813
Wait up.

484
00:21:31,949 --> 00:21:33,550
Thanks for showing me around.

485
00:21:33,686 --> 00:21:34,815
Wait, why did you do that?

486
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,192
Sorry. What did I do?

487
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,056
We just left
our best friends behind.

488
00:21:38,192 --> 00:21:40,270
But what about the new ones
that we're about to meet?

489
00:21:40,294 --> 00:21:41,598
No. Okay.

490
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:44,058
These next three days need
to be about Bree and Grace.

491
00:21:44,194 --> 00:21:46,335
Joy, the next three days
could determine

492
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,264
the next four years
of our lives.

493
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,241
Now, I think that's
overstating things a bit.

494
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:53,809
Ooh, la, la.
Joy is so old school.

495
00:21:53,944 --> 00:21:54,944
What?

496
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:56,507
Look, we all have a job to do.

497
00:21:56,642 --> 00:21:57,706
You make Riley happy,

498
00:21:57,841 --> 00:21:59,076
Sadness makes her sad,

499
00:21:59,212 --> 00:22:01,052
Fear protects her from
the scary stuff she can see,

500
00:22:01,076 --> 00:22:02,747
and my job is to protect her

501
00:22:02,883 --> 00:22:04,647
from the scary stuff
she can't see.

502
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,488
I plan for the future.

503
00:22:06,623 --> 00:22:08,656
Oh, I can show you.
You're gonna love this.

504
00:22:11,758 --> 00:22:13,121
I was using that
as a cup holder.

505
00:22:13,257 --> 00:22:15,562
Okay, so my team
has run all the data,

506
00:22:15,698 --> 00:22:16,945
and we're looking
at the following

507
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:18,028
likely scenarios.

508
00:22:18,163 --> 00:22:19,897
First, we don't take
this camp seriously,

509
00:22:20,032 --> 00:22:21,241
and we goof off
with Bree and Grace.

510
00:22:21,265 --> 00:22:23,735
Riley looks really uncool
in front of Val.

511
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,977
She fails to
impress the coach,

512
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:26,167
does not become a Fire Hawk,

513
00:22:26,302 --> 00:22:28,035
and finally arrives
at high school.

514
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,490
She has no one.

515
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,574
She eats alone,
and only the teachers

516
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,844
- know her name.
- Ew.

517
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,445
Okay, you and I
are gonna be friends.

518
00:22:34,581 --> 00:22:36,810
Oh, this is a sad story.

519
00:22:36,946 --> 00:22:38,589
It's a ridiculous story.

520
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:41,357
Look, again, love the energy,
but you're being silly.

521
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:43,124
None of this
will actually happen.

522
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,518
Right. Whatever you say.

523
00:22:44,653 --> 00:22:46,103
- You're the boss.
- Oh...

524
00:22:46,127 --> 00:22:49,829
Remember when we all finally
came up to Headquarters?

525
00:22:49,964 --> 00:22:52,662
That was like 30 seconds ago,
Nostalgia.

526
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:54,604
Yeah, those were the days.

527
00:22:54,739 --> 00:22:57,299
Nostalgia, you aren't supposed
to be here yet.

528
00:22:57,434 --> 00:22:59,906
You still have about 10 years,
two graduations,

529
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:01,522
and a best friend's wedding
before you're invited,

530
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,226
but I will keep you
in the loop, I promise.

531
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,526
<i>- All right...</i>
- Hey, hey...

532
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,858
<i>- you ready, Riley?</i>
- everybody focus!

533
00:23:05,882 --> 00:23:07,880
Val is leading us
into their holy inner sanctum!

534
00:23:08,015 --> 00:23:09,615
And here we are!

535
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:15,355
<i>These girls are so cool!</i>

536
00:23:15,491 --> 00:23:16,525
<i>And older.</i>

537
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:17,873
We are not changing
in front of them.

538
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:18,990
It's fine!

539
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:20,633
<i>Locker rooms are places
of mutual respect.</i>

540
00:23:20,657 --> 00:23:23,057
Hey, come on! I want you to
meet the other Fire Hawks.

541
00:23:23,192 --> 00:23:24,358
- Hey, girl!
- What's up?

542
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:25,694
Hey.

543
00:23:25,764 --> 00:23:27,137
Riley is from Michigan.

544
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:29,165
Okay, we're stuck with that.

545
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,142
Oh, Cool. Where in Michigan
are you from?

546
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:33,004
- Uh...
- Oh, no. What now?

547
00:23:33,139 --> 00:23:35,012
Okay, looks like
we're committing to this.

548
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,245
Cities in Michigan...

549
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:37,607
We need to make something up.

550
00:23:37,742 --> 00:23:39,873
I'm from all over.

551
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:41,778
Nice. See you out there.

552
00:23:41,913 --> 00:23:43,047
Hey, you wanna sit with us?

553
00:23:43,183 --> 00:23:44,914
<i>Oh, she wants to sit with us.</i>

554
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,116
Everything is beautiful!

555
00:23:47,251 --> 00:23:49,225
There's not enough room
for Bree and Grace.

556
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,022
Oh! Let's go sit over there.

557
00:23:51,157 --> 00:23:52,996
I was gonna go save seats
for my friends.

558
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:54,526
But thanks anyway.

559
00:23:54,661 --> 00:23:56,592
Oh. Uh... Yeah. Okay.

560
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:57,727
No worries.

561
00:23:57,796 --> 00:23:59,564
See? Was that so hard?

562
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,700
No. You're totally right.

563
00:24:00,803 --> 00:24:02,077
That decision's
not gonna haunt us

564
00:24:02,101 --> 00:24:03,867
for the rest
of our lives at all.

565
00:24:04,002 --> 00:24:06,175
- No way!
- Bree and Grace!

566
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:07,736
- There you are.
- Riley.

567
00:24:07,871 --> 00:24:10,643
Time to celebrate!

568
00:24:10,778 --> 00:24:12,943
- Say, "awooga"!
- Awooga!

569
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:15,585
Okay, ladies.
Let's all settle in.

570
00:24:19,018 --> 00:24:20,850
- Uh, Joy?
- Wait, wait, wait.

571
00:24:20,986 --> 00:24:22,127
Ladies!

572
00:24:22,151 --> 00:24:24,687
Settle in means settle down.

573
00:24:24,822 --> 00:24:26,092
I need your focus.

574
00:24:26,227 --> 00:24:28,327
Which means now I'm going
to need your cell phones.

575
00:24:28,462 --> 00:24:29,462
All of 'em.

576
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,425
Wait, what?
Are you serious?

577
00:24:31,561 --> 00:24:35,929
You're here
to work, not goof around.

578
00:24:36,065 --> 00:24:37,299
Got that, Andersen?

579
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:39,939
Yes, Coach.

580
00:24:40,074 --> 00:24:42,072
Please put all your phones
in the basket.

581
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:44,207
You get them back
at the end of camp.

582
00:24:46,175 --> 00:24:49,279
Wow. Coach is so serious.

583
00:24:49,414 --> 00:24:51,747
Joy, I'm just curious.
Maybe, um, I could help...

584
00:24:51,883 --> 00:24:52,883
Thank you. Not now.

585
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,287
I know, right?

586
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,155
Oh.
You think this is funny?

587
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,227
Uh-huh. Well, you know
what else is funny?

588
00:25:00,363 --> 00:25:01,455
Skating lines.

589
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,106
Now hit the ice, ladies.

590
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:05,026
- Great job, Michigan.
- Thanks a lot, new girl.

591
00:25:05,162 --> 00:25:06,901
Just make her do it.

592
00:25:07,037 --> 00:25:10,207
Bravo, Joy.
She's totally fitting in now.

593
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,404
Oh, thanks so much, Wee-Wee.

594
00:25:16,142 --> 00:25:17,878
You're lagging behind,
Andersen!

595
00:25:18,013 --> 00:25:19,873
- Skate harder!
- This is the worst.

596
00:25:21,114 --> 00:25:23,143
All right, ladies,
take a breather.

597
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,314
Then we'll divide into teams.

598
00:25:31,257 --> 00:25:32,598
Oh, that Michigan girl

599
00:25:32,622 --> 00:25:34,725
- is off to a rough start.
<i>- Oh, no.</i>

600
00:25:34,861 --> 00:25:36,094
Are they talking about us?

601
00:25:36,229 --> 00:25:37,830
Yeah, there's no way
Coach is putting her

602
00:25:37,966 --> 00:25:39,407
on the team if she can't
get it together.

603
00:25:39,431 --> 00:25:41,666
Uh, okay, Dani,
like you had it all together

604
00:25:41,802 --> 00:25:42,802
when you were a freshman?

605
00:25:42,934 --> 00:25:44,336
I wasn't that immature.

606
00:25:44,472 --> 00:25:48,903
Dani, you stuck straws
up your nose. Like last night.

607
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,508
Aw. I got you, big guy.

608
00:25:56,048 --> 00:25:57,415
Oh.

609
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,752
I always wanted people to talk
about us, but not like this.

610
00:26:00,887 --> 00:26:03,091
Oh, Joy, what do we do now?

611
00:26:03,226 --> 00:26:04,086
Um...

612
00:26:04,087 --> 00:26:05,391
We can just, um...

613
00:26:05,526 --> 00:26:06,655
I have an idea.

614
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,128
Okay.

615
00:26:08,264 --> 00:26:11,668
If we can get Val on our side,
everything will be great.

616
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,899
Uh, Val?

617
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:18,701
Oh, hey, Riley. What's up?

618
00:26:18,836 --> 00:26:20,138
Uh, I-I...

619
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:23,109
I'm so sorry.

620
00:26:23,245 --> 00:26:25,345
I didn't mean to get
the whole team skating lines.

621
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,513
I feel terrible.

622
00:26:26,648 --> 00:26:27,783
I respect you so much.

623
00:26:27,918 --> 00:26:29,327
I would never do anything
to mess you up.

624
00:26:29,351 --> 00:26:30,897
Uh, that's laying it on
a bit thick, don't you think?

625
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:32,029
- Joy.
<i>- You're a great hockey player,</i>

626
00:26:32,053 --> 00:26:33,413
and you lead the team
so amazingly,

627
00:26:33,516 --> 00:26:34,832
and I really
look up to you and...

628
00:26:34,856 --> 00:26:36,550
Okay, okay. Thanks.

629
00:26:36,686 --> 00:26:39,461
Listen, Coach was pretty hard
on you today,

630
00:26:39,596 --> 00:26:40,957
but that's not a bad thing.

631
00:26:41,093 --> 00:26:42,525
It means you're on her radar.

632
00:26:42,661 --> 00:26:43,766
Really?

633
00:26:43,901 --> 00:26:45,474
Listen, I'm glad you came
to talk with me.

634
00:26:45,498 --> 00:26:47,631
Hey, let's try to be on
the same team later, okay?

635
00:26:47,766 --> 00:26:49,096
Oh, yeah. Cool.

636
00:26:49,231 --> 00:26:50,300
Wow.

637
00:26:50,435 --> 00:26:52,117
- Good job. Wow.
- I wish I could do that.

638
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:54,441
You guys, I mean,
it really wasn't anything.

639
00:26:54,577 --> 00:26:56,143
I'm just trying to help.

640
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:57,576
I agree.

641
00:26:57,712 --> 00:26:59,779
Great job, Anxiety.

642
00:26:59,914 --> 00:27:01,677
I stepped back,
you stepped in,

643
00:27:01,812 --> 00:27:04,720
you got Riley back on track,
now I'm ready to step back in.

644
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:06,519
But that was just
part one of my plan.

645
00:27:06,655 --> 00:27:07,821
There's a part two?

646
00:27:07,957 --> 00:27:10,320
A good plan
has many parts, Joy.

647
00:27:10,455 --> 00:27:12,394
Okay, ladies,
we're gonna form your teams

648
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:13,553
for the rest of camp.

649
00:27:13,689 --> 00:27:14,942
Now, split yourselves
down the middle.

650
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,958
Team one on the right,
team two on the left.

651
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,094
Let's do this!

652
00:27:19,165 --> 00:27:20,645
One more time
on the same team, right?

653
00:27:20,732 --> 00:27:21,738
Right.

654
00:27:23,704 --> 00:27:24,903
Val wants us.

655
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:26,676
But we promised
Bree and Grace.

656
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,646
Joy, we have to
plan for the future.

657
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:33,046
Come on, Riley, move.
Move those feet!

658
00:27:33,182 --> 00:27:34,624
Val's on team one,
you wanna be on team one.

659
00:27:34,648 --> 00:27:35,648
Let's go.

660
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,386
She made a promise
to her friends.

661
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:39,047
She's not gonna break it.

662
00:27:39,183 --> 00:27:41,017
Oh, you're so right, Joy.

663
00:27:42,321 --> 00:27:43,721
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

664
00:27:44,487 --> 00:27:47,225
No! You can't have that.
Put that back.

665
00:27:50,098 --> 00:27:51,140
Joy, I don't mean
to overstep...

666
00:27:51,164 --> 00:27:52,204
- No!
- ...but it has to be done.

667
00:27:52,228 --> 00:27:54,034
What are you... No!

668
00:28:02,446 --> 00:28:04,008
No...

669
00:28:04,143 --> 00:28:06,574
I know change is scary,
but watch.

670
00:28:08,685 --> 00:28:10,688
I'm so excited.

671
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:14,483
All right.
Welcome to our team, Michigan.

672
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:22,531
That is not Riley.

673
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:23,997
I know. It's a better Riley.

674
00:28:24,132 --> 00:28:26,295
A Riley who won't be alone
next year.

675
00:28:26,431 --> 00:28:28,633
We build her
a new Sense of Self.

676
00:28:28,768 --> 00:28:30,631
A brand-new her.

677
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:32,335
No, no, no!

678
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:33,620
You can't go down there
with that.

679
00:28:33,644 --> 00:28:35,746
Over my dead flaming body!

680
00:28:37,514 --> 00:28:38,882
I am truly sorry.

681
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:41,477
I was so looking forward
to working with you guys.

682
00:28:41,612 --> 00:28:43,219
Hey, hey! What do you think
you're doing?

683
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:44,354
Get off me!

684
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,747
Riley's life
is more complex now.

685
00:28:45,883 --> 00:28:48,285
It requires more sophisticated
emotions than all of you.

686
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,851
You just aren't what
she needs anymore, Joy.

687
00:28:52,057 --> 00:28:53,628
How dare you, madam!

688
00:28:53,763 --> 00:28:55,529
You can't just bottle us up!

689
00:28:55,665 --> 00:28:57,095
Oh! That's a great idea.

690
00:28:57,231 --> 00:28:59,367
I can't breathe.

691
00:28:59,502 --> 00:29:00,502
I can't breathe!

692
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,570
It's not forever.

693
00:29:01,697 --> 00:29:02,884
It's just
until Riley makes varsity,

694
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,707
or until she turns 18,
or maybe forever.

695
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:05,948
I don't know.
We'll have to see.

696
00:29:05,972 --> 00:29:07,071
- Bye!
- Anxiety!

697
00:29:07,206 --> 00:29:09,010
Riley needs us!

698
00:29:09,841 --> 00:29:10,946
Okay.

699
00:29:11,081 --> 00:29:12,749
Don't worry, Riley.
You're in good hands.

700
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:15,214
Now let's change
everything about you.

701
00:29:21,325 --> 00:29:22,325
Huh?

702
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,491
Quick question. How do we
build a new Riley,

703
00:29:27,626 --> 00:29:29,865
which I'm loving, by the way,
amazing concept,

704
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:33,233
if it took them 13 years
to build the old one?

705
00:29:33,369 --> 00:29:35,597
Well, good news is we're not
starting from scratch.

706
00:29:36,771 --> 00:29:37,837
I wanna plant one.

707
00:29:37,973 --> 00:29:39,275
Next time.

708
00:29:45,377 --> 00:29:46,882
<i>If I'm</i>

709
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:49,116
<i>a Fire Hawk,
I won't be alone.</i>

710
00:29:57,991 --> 00:29:59,456
No, no, no!

711
00:30:00,123 --> 00:30:01,160
Let us out now!

712
00:30:01,296 --> 00:30:03,460
No, stop!
Stop! Let us out!

713
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:05,601
Uh, Joy...

714
00:30:13,176 --> 00:30:16,640
We're gonna
be in here forever.

715
00:30:21,316 --> 00:30:22,656
Where are you putting us?

716
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,783
The same place we keep
all of Riley's secrets.

717
00:30:24,918 --> 00:30:26,021
We're not secrets.

718
00:30:26,156 --> 00:30:27,735
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
"We're not secrets.

719
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,187
"We're making a big mistake."

720
00:30:29,323 --> 00:30:30,563
Never heard
that before.

721
00:30:34,765 --> 00:30:37,798
We are suppressed emotions!

722
00:30:37,934 --> 00:30:39,736
Let us out! Right now!

723
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,700
No, no, no.
Riley's gonna be fine.

724
00:30:41,836 --> 00:30:43,106
Totally fine.

725
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,735
Hey, there.
You know what we call that?

726
00:30:45,871 --> 00:30:46,904
Denial.

727
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,502
Can you say denial?

728
00:30:48,637 --> 00:30:50,476
Hi, friends.

729
00:30:50,612 --> 00:30:54,484
Welcome. It's so good to have
you here with us today.

730
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,413
It's Bloofy!

731
00:30:56,548 --> 00:30:58,684
From that preschool show
Riley used to like?

732
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,919
That's right!

733
00:31:00,054 --> 00:31:02,024
And here's a little secret.

734
00:31:03,721 --> 00:31:06,261
Riley still likes the show.

735
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:07,634
<i>♪ Stomp like an elephant ♪</i>

736
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:09,123
<i>♪ Scurry like a mouse ♪</i>

737
00:31:09,258 --> 00:31:11,532
<i>♪ Make your way down
To Bloofy's house! ♪</i>

738
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:12,735
Please kill me.

739
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,903
Bloofy,
we're in a real pickle.

740
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,696
Could you help us
get out of here?

741
00:31:16,832 --> 00:31:19,673
Uh-oh.
We're gonna need your help.

742
00:31:19,809 --> 00:31:21,637
Can you find a way out?

743
00:31:22,507 --> 00:31:25,147
- Who are you talking to?
- My friends.

744
00:31:25,649 --> 00:31:27,412
Do you see a key?

745
00:31:28,848 --> 00:31:29,848
Hmm.

746
00:31:29,982 --> 00:31:31,553
I don't either.

747
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:32,689
Okay, we're doomed.

748
00:31:32,756 --> 00:31:33,986
Indeed.

749
00:31:34,122 --> 00:31:37,120
Welcome to your eternal fate.

750
00:31:37,256 --> 00:31:39,289
Lance Slashblade?

751
00:31:39,424 --> 00:31:41,496
But he's
a video game character.

752
00:31:41,631 --> 00:31:42,924
Why is he here?

753
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,391
Yeah, I always thought Riley
had a secret crush on him.

754
00:31:45,527 --> 00:31:46,898
I never saw the appeal.

755
00:31:47,034 --> 00:31:49,133
I long to be a hero,

756
00:31:49,268 --> 00:31:51,764
but darkness haunts my past.

757
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,050
I get it.

758
00:31:53,074 --> 00:31:54,377
I'm in a hundred percent.

759
00:31:56,243 --> 00:31:57,913
- Uh... Who's that?
- Oh!

760
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:00,683
That's Riley's
Deep Dark Secret.

761
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:02,645
What... What is the secret?

762
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:04,717
You don't wanna know.

763
00:32:04,852 --> 00:32:06,055
Riley's secrets,

764
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:08,452
a rogue emotion
has taken over Headquarters.

765
00:32:08,588 --> 00:32:10,617
Now, if you could just
open the jar...

766
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,662
Hey, kids,
let's learn some Latin.

767
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:14,598
Do you know <i>quid pro quo?</i>

768
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:16,063
We get you out of that jar,

769
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:17,895
then you get us
out of this safe.

770
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,034
No, Bloofy.

771
00:32:19,169 --> 00:32:21,769
Their destiny
is not ours to change.

772
00:32:21,905 --> 00:32:23,539
We were all banished here,

773
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:26,171
deemed unfit, worthless.

774
00:32:26,306 --> 00:32:28,109
Don't you dare say that.

775
00:32:28,244 --> 00:32:30,437
You do not deserve
to be thrown away.

776
00:32:30,572 --> 00:32:31,705
Uh, one second, Lance.

777
00:32:31,841 --> 00:32:34,074
Don't you remember
his power move?

778
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,861
I'm coming for you, Riley!

779
00:32:35,885 --> 00:32:37,751
Oh, yeah? Watch this!

780
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:40,623
Come on!

781
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,758
You listen to me,
Lance Slashblade.

782
00:32:42,893 --> 00:32:44,358
No one is totally worthless.

783
00:32:44,493 --> 00:32:47,789
But I am a warrior cursed
with a feeble attack.

784
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:51,331
Then you must make your curse
your gift.

785
00:32:52,364 --> 00:32:54,198
Shield yourself, my friends,

786
00:32:54,334 --> 00:32:57,073
for I shall set you all free!

787
00:33:01,778 --> 00:33:02,778
Hey, little help?

788
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:07,646
Great job, Dark Secret.

789
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:10,549
Now it's your turn to help us.

790
00:33:10,685 --> 00:33:13,547
My pouch has just the thing
to get us out of here.

791
00:33:13,682 --> 00:33:17,423
Everybody say, "Oh, Pouchy!"

792
00:33:18,058 --> 00:33:20,191
Oh, Pouchy!

793
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:25,129
Hi, everybody. I'm Pouchy.

794
00:33:25,265 --> 00:33:26,970
Pouchy, we need to escape.

795
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:28,836
Do you have anything
that can help us?

796
00:33:28,971 --> 00:33:30,502
I have lots of items.

797
00:33:30,637 --> 00:33:32,871
Which one do you think
will work the best?

798
00:33:33,006 --> 00:33:34,376
A tomato,

799
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,645
a frog,

800
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,811
or exploding dynamite?

801
00:33:37,947 --> 00:33:39,413
Oh, for crying out loud.

802
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,717
Yay! We did it, everyone!

803
00:33:43,853 --> 00:33:44,878
Let's all sing

804
00:33:45,014 --> 00:33:46,522
the "We did it" song.

805
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:48,024
No time!

806
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,451
Thank you, friends. I must...

807
00:33:50,586 --> 00:33:52,760
I must be leaving you.

808
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,329
What about Dark Secret?

809
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:58,531
Not yet.

810
00:33:59,534 --> 00:34:01,402
Yeah, that's probably best
for everybody.

811
00:34:01,537 --> 00:34:03,863
Hey! Who let you out?
Get back in there!

812
00:34:03,999 --> 00:34:05,575
- Oh, boy.
- What are we gonna do?

813
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,168
Oh, disgusted one,

814
00:34:07,303 --> 00:34:11,613
as you once believed in me,
I will now believe in myself.

815
00:34:15,454 --> 00:34:16,885
Huh?

816
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,550
Wait. What?

817
00:34:21,585 --> 00:34:22,790
Ooh!

818
00:34:27,262 --> 00:34:30,131
Whoa! What's happening? Whoa!

819
00:34:33,736 --> 00:34:34,736
No...

820
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:35,871
Dave, help! Help!

821
00:34:36,002 --> 00:34:37,207
Hold on!

822
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:38,609
Dave!

823
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,777
Lance!

824
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:42,913
Goodbye, friends.

825
00:34:43,043 --> 00:34:45,212
Hello, destiny!

826
00:34:45,348 --> 00:34:46,778
Well, there's a lid
for every pot.

827
00:34:46,914 --> 00:34:48,118
Come on!

828
00:34:49,814 --> 00:34:51,166
What do we do?
What do we do?

829
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,013
Whoa, Anger, stop.
Where are you going?

830
00:34:53,148 --> 00:34:55,824
Um, back to Headquarters,
to help Riley!

831
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:57,417
Riley's not up there.

832
00:34:57,552 --> 00:34:58,920
She's out there.

833
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,628
We can't go back
without her Sense of Self.

834
00:35:01,764 --> 00:35:05,097
You want us to go all the way
to the Back of the Mind?

835
00:35:05,233 --> 00:35:07,362
Are you out of your mind?

836
00:35:07,498 --> 00:35:08,697
But, Joy, how will we...

837
00:35:08,832 --> 00:35:09,951
- Freeze!
- Come on!

838
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:11,014
Hold it right there!

839
00:35:12,578 --> 00:35:15,507
How do we get there?
Do you even have a plan, Joy?

840
00:35:15,643 --> 00:35:18,280
I bet Anxiety would have
a really good plan...

841
00:35:18,415 --> 00:35:20,319
Of course I have a plan.
Who doesn't have a plan?

842
00:35:20,343 --> 00:35:22,777
Look, she's not the only one
who can project the future.

843
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:26,085
First, all we have to do is,
uh...

844
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,718
<i>Give me a second.</i>

845
00:35:27,853 --> 00:35:30,226
<i>Ooh! Follow the stream
of consciousness,</i>

846
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:31,953
<i>and then we take
a nice, easy float</i>

847
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:33,374
<i>all the way
to the Back of the Mind.</i>

848
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:34,767
<i>Where all
the bad memories are.</i>

849
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:35,958
<i>Exactly. And there,</i>

850
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:38,696
<i>we'll find the Riley
we know and love.</i>

851
00:35:38,831 --> 00:35:40,269
<i>We'll put her
Sense of Self back,</i>

852
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:42,271
<i>and then Riley
will be Riley again.</i>

853
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:43,644
<i>Okay,
I'm gonna give it to you.</i>

854
00:35:43,668 --> 00:35:44,730
<i>That could actually work.</i>

855
00:35:44,866 --> 00:35:46,134
<i>Yeah, it could!</i>

856
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:50,104
<i>And then I tell Anxiety, "Hey,
don't worry so much anymore."</i>

857
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,509
<i>And she'll say,
"Wow, Joy, I never thought</i>

858
00:35:52,644 --> 00:35:53,910
<i>"of that before. Thank you."</i>

859
00:35:54,046 --> 00:35:55,386
<i>And then we hug
and become best friends...</i>

860
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:57,945
<i>And then I punt her
into the dump.</i>

861
00:35:58,081 --> 00:35:59,196
What? No, Anger.

862
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,323
Okay, fine. No punting.

863
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,491
Don't worry, I know
right where the stream is.

864
00:36:04,626 --> 00:36:07,128
Sadness and I
have been here before. Oh.

865
00:36:07,263 --> 00:36:09,131
Joy, this is a dead end.

866
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,761
Those are the worst kinds
of ends!

867
00:36:11,897 --> 00:36:15,396
Everything's changing so fast!

868
00:36:15,531 --> 00:36:16,668
So, we're lost.

869
00:36:16,804 --> 00:36:19,105
No. You're never lost
if you're having fun.

870
00:36:19,241 --> 00:36:20,536
No one is having fun, Joy.

871
00:36:20,672 --> 00:36:22,174
Oh, come on! Look at Sadness.

872
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,743
She's having a great time.

873
00:36:25,273 --> 00:36:26,833
I thought you knew
where you were going.

874
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:27,976
I do. I did.

875
00:36:28,111 --> 00:36:29,791
- I just need a moment.
- She doesn't know.

876
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:31,254
We're stuck here!

877
00:36:32,021 --> 00:36:33,654
Oh, Riley's awake.

878
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,124
Wait, she's up too early.
What are they doing to her?

879
00:36:36,259 --> 00:36:38,261
Come on,
we'll find another way.

880
00:36:39,858 --> 00:36:42,155
Don't worry, Riley.
We're coming.

881
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:51,132
Why are we up so early?

882
00:36:51,267 --> 00:36:53,671
Because, <i>mon ami,</i>
we need to speed things up,

883
00:36:53,806 --> 00:36:55,206
and that means
we hit the ice early,

884
00:36:55,273 --> 00:36:57,841
<i>and practice like
we've never practiced before.</i>

885
00:36:57,976 --> 00:36:59,576
<i>Aren't we already good
at hockey?</i>

886
00:36:59,709 --> 00:37:00,844
<i>We're good.</i>

887
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,352
- But the Fire Hawks are great.
- That's right!

888
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:08,137
<i>Every time we miss,</i>

889
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,336
<i>we skate a lap
around the rink.</i>

890
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,452
Hockey is not a game,
it is a sport.

891
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:24,565
- Yes!
<i>- Wow.</i>

892
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,833
That was amazing.

893
00:37:25,969 --> 00:37:27,909
We need to be that good
every time.

894
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:29,403
Let's run it again.

895
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,290
Hey, I see I'm not the only
one who likes to start early.

896
00:37:31,314 --> 00:37:32,508
<i>You guys, it's Val!</i>

897
00:37:32,643 --> 00:37:33,775
We had the same idea.

898
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,150
We're basically
the same person.

899
00:37:35,284 --> 00:37:36,678
We're gonna be best friends.

900
00:37:36,813 --> 00:37:38,119
How long have you been here?

901
00:37:38,254 --> 00:37:40,080
I don't know. Maybe an hour.

902
00:37:40,215 --> 00:37:42,649
I just wanted to get in
some extra ice time.

903
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,787
I'm the same way.

904
00:37:43,922 --> 00:37:45,395
<i>Oh, my gosh. She gets us.</i>

905
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,791
See? I told the other girls
you'd figure it out.

906
00:37:47,927 --> 00:37:50,190
You get what it takes
to be the best.

907
00:37:52,496 --> 00:37:53,561
Look at us.

908
00:37:53,697 --> 00:37:55,272
This is going great!

909
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:57,934
Yeah! But we need Val
to really like us.

910
00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:00,067
Oh, we should ask Val
lots of questions.

911
00:38:00,203 --> 00:38:01,774
People love
talking about themselves.

912
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:05,071
So, what was your freshman year
on the Fire Hawks like?

913
00:38:05,206 --> 00:38:07,873
I mean,
it was a lot of work,

914
00:38:08,009 --> 00:38:09,385
like, a lot...

915
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,779
but it's also
how I met my best friends.

916
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,918
Val is sharing things with us!

917
00:38:14,054 --> 00:38:16,059
Hey, a few of us are just
gonna hang out tonight,

918
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:18,151
order some food.
You should come.

919
00:38:18,287 --> 00:38:20,620
Oh! An exclusive invitation.

920
00:38:20,755 --> 00:38:21,965
We're going!

921
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,392
- Really?
- Definitely.

922
00:38:23,528 --> 00:38:24,598
It'll be fun.

923
00:38:24,733 --> 00:38:26,534
All right, ladies,
let's warm up.

924
00:38:28,004 --> 00:38:29,132
Hey, Riley.

925
00:38:29,268 --> 00:38:30,268
Hi.

926
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:32,164
We are not sharing Val
with them.

927
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,370
Early mornings
make me so hungry.

928
00:38:34,506 --> 00:38:35,742
I know, right?

929
00:38:35,878 --> 00:38:38,108
I'd give anything for a piece
of pizza right now.

930
00:38:38,244 --> 00:38:39,148
Yes!

931
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,984
See? I told you I'd find it.

932
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,408
The Stream of Consciousness.

933
00:38:42,543 --> 00:38:45,450
- But, Joy...
- Wow! Our girl is hungry.

934
00:38:45,585 --> 00:38:46,681
Hop on something delicious!

935
00:38:46,817 --> 00:38:48,015
- Joy...
- Ooh, deep dish.

936
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,892
And it's still warm.

937
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:51,487
Extra cheese, baby!

938
00:38:51,622 --> 00:38:52,622
Sadness, come on.

939
00:38:52,694 --> 00:38:53,988
But I've been trying
to tell you.

940
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:56,290
We can't take the tube back,
Joy.

941
00:38:56,425 --> 00:38:59,035
Someone has to be
at the console to recall us.

942
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:01,095
She's right. We'd be stranded.

943
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,808
Yeah. Anxiety would have
thought about that.

944
00:39:02,832 --> 00:39:04,334
Well, I doubt it. Fine.

945
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:05,937
Okay. Uh...

946
00:39:06,072 --> 00:39:08,869
So, someone's gonna have to
crawl up that tube,

947
00:39:09,004 --> 00:39:10,213
and go back to Headquarters,

948
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,006
and at the right moment,
bring us back.

949
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:13,806
Oh, I'll do it.
I'll pound that...

950
00:39:13,942 --> 00:39:15,177
I don't think so, punty.

951
00:39:15,313 --> 00:39:16,930
- Okay, here's the thing.
- You were never an option.

952
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,080
Thank you.

953
00:39:18,216 --> 00:39:20,351
You want me to crawl through
a tube in this?

954
00:39:20,487 --> 00:39:21,721
Yeah, not happening.

955
00:39:24,557 --> 00:39:27,228
Oh, no, not me.

956
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:29,124
Yes! Sadness, you could do it.

957
00:39:29,259 --> 00:39:31,366
You know the console
better than anybody.

958
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:33,629
You've read the manuals
cover to cover.

959
00:39:33,764 --> 00:39:35,066
I mean, you say that,

960
00:39:35,202 --> 00:39:38,637
but I know a lot less about
Manual 28, Chapter Seven,

961
00:39:38,773 --> 00:39:40,437
"How to Recall
Non-Memory Objects"

962
00:39:40,573 --> 00:39:42,070
than most folks realize.

963
00:39:42,206 --> 00:39:43,803
You've proven my point
for me, Sadness.

964
00:39:43,939 --> 00:39:44,974
That sounds like a yes.

965
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,127
<i>Where is everybody?</i>

966
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:47,274
<i>You on break again?</i>

967
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,318
Ooh! Walkie-talkies. Here.
Check-check-check.

968
00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:50,763
Can you hear me?
I gotta press a button.

969
00:39:50,787 --> 00:39:53,146
<i>Go for Joy. Copy that. Over.</i>
Oh, I love 'em!

970
00:39:53,282 --> 00:39:54,642
We'll signal you
when we get there,

971
00:39:54,756 --> 00:39:56,484
- and then you bring us back.
- Oh...

972
00:39:56,619 --> 00:39:58,859
Sadness, it's the fastest
way back to Headquarters.

973
00:39:58,888 --> 00:39:59,888
Joy, I can't do it.

974
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:02,426
I'm not strong like you are.

975
00:40:02,562 --> 00:40:03,866
I know you, Sadness.

976
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,424
You are strong.

977
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,498
I can't give you
specific examples right now,

978
00:40:08,633 --> 00:40:10,132
but you got this.

979
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:14,209
Just don't look down
and keep moving.

980
00:40:14,344 --> 00:40:15,935
Yeah, I can do it.

981
00:40:19,073 --> 00:40:20,674
She'll be okay. Right?

982
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:22,545
Uh, fifty-fifty.

983
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,586
Mmm! You want one?

984
00:40:25,685 --> 00:40:26,748
But we hate those things.

985
00:40:26,884 --> 00:40:28,448
They taste like cardboard.

986
00:40:28,584 --> 00:40:30,884
We can't say no to Val.

987
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,853
Okay, no, you're so right.

988
00:40:32,989 --> 00:40:34,230
We eat whatever Val eats.

989
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:35,828
- That's the spirit!
- Whoo!

990
00:40:35,963 --> 00:40:38,192
Envy, I think you're really
in the zone.

991
00:40:38,327 --> 00:40:39,687
Take the wheel,
I'll be right back.

992
00:40:39,761 --> 00:40:41,675
She picked me! She picked me.
Did you see that, Ennui?

993
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:42,699
She picked me.

994
00:40:42,771 --> 00:40:44,599
You care too much
about things.

995
00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:47,003
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

996
00:40:47,138 --> 00:40:49,803
It's got
a very interesting texture.

997
00:40:49,939 --> 00:40:52,205
It tastes like... Mmm...

998
00:40:52,341 --> 00:40:54,374
What does it remind me of?
Um...

999
00:40:55,377 --> 00:40:58,850
Cardboard? Asparagus?
Broccoli?

1000
00:40:58,985 --> 00:41:00,653
What are they doing to her
up there?

1001
00:41:00,789 --> 00:41:02,123
I don't know,
but we have to go.

1002
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:03,349
No! No way am I step...

1003
00:41:03,485 --> 00:41:06,291
We have to. Riley needs us.

1004
00:41:06,426 --> 00:41:07,457
Okay, fine!

1005
00:41:07,592 --> 00:41:09,288
Ugh. Ew! Ew!

1006
00:41:10,865 --> 00:41:13,262
Gross.
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1007
00:41:26,277 --> 00:41:27,726
<i>If I'm good at hockey,</i>

1008
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,853
<i>I'll have friends.</i>

1009
00:41:38,259 --> 00:41:39,187
Whoo!

1010
00:41:39,188 --> 00:41:40,288
- Yeah!
- Okay, Miss Riley.

1011
00:41:40,423 --> 00:41:41,509
- Way to go, Michigan.
- Nice one, Michigan.

1012
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:43,792
All right, ladies.
Great day today.

1013
00:41:43,927 --> 00:41:45,326
Take it easy tonight.

1014
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,032
Yes! This is the moment
we've been waiting for.

1015
00:41:48,168 --> 00:41:51,005
<i>Party time with Val
and our future besties!</i>

1016
00:41:51,908 --> 00:41:53,537
<i>Why are we stopping?
What's going on?</i>

1017
00:41:53,673 --> 00:41:55,308
There it is.

1018
00:41:55,443 --> 00:41:56,974
The red notebook.

1019
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:59,445
Don't say it like that.
You'll freak her out.

1020
00:41:59,581 --> 00:42:00,744
Why would it freak me out?

1021
00:42:00,879 --> 00:42:01,999
Mmm, only because everything

1022
00:42:02,048 --> 00:42:03,548
Coach thinks about you
is in there.

1023
00:42:03,683 --> 00:42:05,345
The good and the bad.

1024
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,719
Whether she wants you
on the team...

1025
00:42:07,855 --> 00:42:09,285
- Or not.
- You guys, too much.

1026
00:42:09,421 --> 00:42:12,219
- What? It's the truth.
- She's not wrong.

1027
00:42:12,355 --> 00:42:14,057
What do you think
she's written about us?

1028
00:42:14,192 --> 00:42:15,989
I don't know.
Do you think it's bad?

1029
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:18,125
Well, I didn't until now!

1030
00:42:18,261 --> 00:42:19,427
What if she's made
a list of

1031
00:42:19,562 --> 00:42:21,010
all her favorite players,
and we're not on it?

1032
00:42:21,034 --> 00:42:22,534
Or a list of
all the worst players,

1033
00:42:22,669 --> 00:42:23,671
and we're at the top?

1034
00:42:23,806 --> 00:42:25,241
Or worse,
we're not on either list,

1035
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,568
and we fade into obscurity!

1036
00:42:27,704 --> 00:42:30,173
Uh, sorry to interrupt you,
but they're walking away.

1037
00:42:30,308 --> 00:42:31,621
<i>We're losing them,</i>

1038
00:42:31,645 --> 00:42:32,648
<i>we're losing them.</i>

1039
00:42:34,214 --> 00:42:36,142
<i>Okay.
First big hang with the group.</i>

1040
00:42:36,278 --> 00:42:38,250
<i>We just gotta act casual.</i>

1041
00:42:38,385 --> 00:42:40,752
<i>Uh, why do our arms swing
like that when we walk?</i>

1042
00:42:40,887 --> 00:42:42,351
<i>Try to keep them still.</i>

1043
00:42:42,487 --> 00:42:44,207
<i>- That looks crazy.
- Okay.</i>

1044
00:42:44,291 --> 00:42:47,355
Well, walk like Dani.
Her arms have rhythm.

1045
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:49,093
<i>No, you're making it worse!</i>

1046
00:42:49,228 --> 00:42:50,403
<i>Well,
that wasn't my intention.</i>

1047
00:42:50,427 --> 00:42:52,098
<i>I'm sorry
for trying something!</i>

1048
00:42:52,234 --> 00:42:54,170
<i>Uh, what do you think
pockets are for?</i>

1049
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:55,429
<i>Oh, that's good.</i>

1050
00:42:55,565 --> 00:42:56,942
<i>Ennui,
I am very proud of you.</i>

1051
00:42:58,271 --> 00:42:59,578
<i>What are they
laughing about?</i>

1052
00:42:59,602 --> 00:43:01,218
Does anybody know
what cool people laugh about?

1053
00:43:01,242 --> 00:43:02,951
I don't know. We were too
focused on the arms thing.

1054
00:43:02,975 --> 00:43:04,572
Just pretend we get the joke.

1055
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,555
Joy, Anger is
taking up the floret.

1056
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:16,016
Fear, what is the matter
with you?

1057
00:43:16,152 --> 00:43:17,391
I don't like this vessel.

1058
00:43:17,527 --> 00:43:18,527
Well, that's all we have.

1059
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,950
How much longer
till we get there?

1060
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,380
We'll get there
when we get there.

1061
00:43:21,494 --> 00:43:23,600
I bet Anxiety would know
how long, down to the minute.

1062
00:43:23,624 --> 00:43:25,631
Well, she just knows
everything, doesn't she?

1063
00:43:25,767 --> 00:43:26,887
Look,
I don't like her words,

1064
00:43:26,933 --> 00:43:28,133
and I do not like her actions.

1065
00:43:28,198 --> 00:43:29,398
I just think I can change her.

1066
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:31,997
You know what?
Who likes banana bread?

1067
00:43:32,133 --> 00:43:33,407
Show of hands.

1068
00:43:36,913 --> 00:43:39,344
So, Michigan,
who's your favorite band?

1069
00:43:39,479 --> 00:43:40,843
Uh...

1070
00:43:40,979 --> 00:43:42,180
Everyone's staring at us.

1071
00:43:42,315 --> 00:43:44,918
There's only one right answer
to this question.

1072
00:43:45,053 --> 00:43:47,584
Oh! Get Up and Glow!
They're so awesome.

1073
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:48,954
Get Up and Glow!

1074
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:51,351
I was all over them
in middle school.

1075
00:43:51,487 --> 00:43:52,736
- Are you serious?
- Yeah,

1076
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,289
I was a Glow Girly. Relax.

1077
00:43:54,425 --> 00:43:56,760
No! We need a band
they think is cool,

1078
00:43:56,896 --> 00:43:58,062
not one we actually like.

1079
00:43:58,197 --> 00:44:00,498
Quick, recall everything
we know about music.

1080
00:44:03,338 --> 00:44:04,338
Uh-oh!

1081
00:44:16,447 --> 00:44:19,084
We have to know
one cool song, right?

1082
00:44:21,352 --> 00:44:23,198
<i>- ♪ TripleDent gum ♪
- ♪ Will make you smile ♪</i>

1083
00:44:23,222 --> 00:44:24,531
Embarrassment,
get that out of there!

1084
00:44:24,555 --> 00:44:25,871
Come on, there's gotta be
something in here.

1085
00:44:25,895 --> 00:44:27,160
I'm looking,
I'm looking.

1086
00:44:27,295 --> 00:44:28,023
Something better,
something cool. Come on.

1087
00:44:28,024 --> 00:44:30,630
No, not that. No.

1088
00:44:30,765 --> 00:44:31,866
This is the best we have!

1089
00:44:32,001 --> 00:44:34,361
It's mostly jingles
and Dad's yacht rock.

1090
00:44:34,497 --> 00:44:36,601
But, I mean,
you don't still like

1091
00:44:36,737 --> 00:44:38,365
Get Up and Glow, do you?

1092
00:44:38,501 --> 00:44:40,233
Okay, don't panic.
What do we do?

1093
00:44:40,369 --> 00:44:41,605
If we don't like their music,

1094
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:42,777
we have nothing

1095
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:43,920
to offer these girls.

1096
00:44:43,944 --> 00:44:45,144
We'll be outed as the imposter

1097
00:44:45,179 --> 00:44:46,554
- that we obviously are.
<i>- Pardon. Excusez moi.</i>

1098
00:44:46,578 --> 00:44:49,283
I've been waiting my whole
life for this very moment.

1099
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:53,854
Oh, yeah.
I love Get Up and Glow.

1100
00:44:53,989 --> 00:44:56,451
<i>Love Get Up and Glow.</i>

1101
00:45:02,729 --> 00:45:04,266
Abandon broccoli!

1102
00:45:12,339 --> 00:45:14,704
- Joy!
- Give us your hand! Come on.

1103
00:45:16,512 --> 00:45:17,906
What is that?

1104
00:45:18,042 --> 00:45:19,513
That's a Sar-chasm.

1105
00:45:19,648 --> 00:45:20,975
It can open for miles!

1106
00:45:21,111 --> 00:45:22,614
Run for your lives!

1107
00:45:22,749 --> 00:45:24,853
Sar-chasm? Really?

1108
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:26,225
<i>Get Up and Glow</i>

1109
00:45:26,249 --> 00:45:27,588
<i>is my favorite band.</i>

1110
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:29,317
But she loves Get Up and Glow.

1111
00:45:29,453 --> 00:45:31,259
They choreograph
their own dances.

1112
00:45:31,394 --> 00:45:32,322
Okay, Joy,

1113
00:45:32,323 --> 00:45:33,433
if we can't follow the stream,

1114
00:45:33,457 --> 00:45:34,600
we don't know
where we're going.

1115
00:45:34,624 --> 00:45:36,004
And if we don't know
where we're going,

1116
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:37,361
we can't follow the stream!

1117
00:45:37,497 --> 00:45:41,669
It is an endless loop
of tragedy and consequence!

1118
00:45:41,804 --> 00:45:43,470
Or we could just
ask those guys.

1119
00:45:43,605 --> 00:45:44,906
Oh, yeah. Or that.

1120
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:47,943
Boy, are we so lucky
we ran into you guys!

1121
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:51,107
Boy, are we so lucky

1122
00:45:51,243 --> 00:45:54,683
- we ran into you guys!
- Huh?

1123
00:45:54,819 --> 00:45:57,613
Please,
we really need your help!

1124
00:45:57,749 --> 00:46:00,686
We really need your help.

1125
00:46:00,821 --> 00:46:02,120
What's their problem?

1126
00:46:02,256 --> 00:46:04,325
Guys, you just gotta
turn on the charm.

1127
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,686
Hey!

1128
00:46:05,822 --> 00:46:07,166
I bet you're the best

1129
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:09,794
crane crew in the world!

1130
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:12,098
Wow, those guys are jerks.

1131
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,763
Wow, those guys are jerks.

1132
00:46:15,899 --> 00:46:19,873
Oh, yeah.
Get Up and Glow is so awesome.

1133
00:46:20,009 --> 00:46:21,777
Riley, what are you
talking about?

1134
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:23,975
- You love Get Up and Glow.
- Oh. Uh...

1135
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,574
Hey, guys.

1136
00:46:26,077 --> 00:46:27,077
Why are our best friends

1137
00:46:27,181 --> 00:46:28,808
always trying to
hang out with us?

1138
00:46:28,943 --> 00:46:31,583
Come on, Riley,
we just went to their concert.

1139
00:46:31,718 --> 00:46:32,722
Well, yeah.

1140
00:46:32,857 --> 00:46:34,422
- I mean, sure, but like...
- But what?

1141
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:35,716
We had a great time.

1142
00:46:35,851 --> 00:46:37,494
Grace, you are not helping.

1143
00:46:37,518 --> 00:46:38,652
Oh, yeah,

1144
00:46:38,788 --> 00:46:40,548
we had a great time.

1145
00:46:40,665 --> 00:46:42,392
<i>Great time.</i>

1146
00:46:44,231 --> 00:46:45,897
Why can't they just
leave her alone?

1147
00:46:46,033 --> 00:46:47,397
What are we gonna do now, Joy?

1148
00:46:47,532 --> 00:46:49,971
We go the long way,
which is the best way.

1149
00:46:50,106 --> 00:46:52,534
Stretch those hammies, Anger.
Let's go.

1150
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:55,172
Best night of my life.

1151
00:46:55,308 --> 00:46:57,378
Well,
this has been really fun.

1152
00:46:57,513 --> 00:46:58,611
Extremely.

1153
00:46:58,747 --> 00:46:59,747
But we're gonna go now.

1154
00:46:59,845 --> 00:47:01,346
Okay, bye.

1155
00:47:01,481 --> 00:47:02,760
Oh, this is

1156
00:47:02,784 --> 00:47:03,853
the best band ever!

1157
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:06,086
- Okay, Riley!
- Michigan knows what's up!

1158
00:47:07,419 --> 00:47:09,086
See? As long as
we like what they like,

1159
00:47:09,221 --> 00:47:10,461
we have all the friends
we need.

1160
00:47:10,588 --> 00:47:11,970
Night, guys.

1161
00:47:11,994 --> 00:47:13,894
Well, I think
I'm calling it a night.

1162
00:47:14,029 --> 00:47:16,030
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, it's late.

1163
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,237
Plus, I think
you'll want to get some sleep

1164
00:47:17,261 --> 00:47:18,399
before tomorrow's scrimmage.

1165
00:47:18,534 --> 00:47:19,894
What scrimmage?

1166
00:47:20,029 --> 00:47:22,180
Uh. It's just something Coach
always does on the last day.

1167
00:47:22,204 --> 00:47:23,900
It's how Val made the team
as a freshman.

1168
00:47:24,036 --> 00:47:25,036
Don't tell her that.

1169
00:47:25,169 --> 00:47:26,742
Val scored two goals.

1170
00:47:26,878 --> 00:47:28,409
No freshman
has ever done that.

1171
00:47:28,544 --> 00:47:29,804
Dani, stop.

1172
00:47:29,939 --> 00:47:31,921
Technically, it's not your
tryout for the next year,

1173
00:47:31,945 --> 00:47:33,980
but it basically is.

1174
00:47:34,116 --> 00:47:36,047
You'll do great.
Just be yourself.

1175
00:47:36,182 --> 00:47:37,315
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

1176
00:47:37,451 --> 00:47:39,386
We could become a Fire Hawk,
like, tomorrow.

1177
00:47:39,521 --> 00:47:42,722
But how do we be ourself if
our new self isn't ready yet?

1178
00:47:42,858 --> 00:47:44,189
Excellent point.

1179
00:47:44,324 --> 00:47:46,352
Let's get
these memories downstairs.

1180
00:47:47,892 --> 00:47:49,096
Oh...

1181
00:47:57,431 --> 00:47:59,909
Is that broccoli?

1182
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:02,411
We're getting
deeper and deeper in, Joy.

1183
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,546
Great observation.

1184
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:04,737
The long way did turn out

1185
00:48:04,873 --> 00:48:05,959
to be a little longer
than I thought.

1186
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:07,345
Anyway,
who wants to sing a song?

1187
00:48:07,481 --> 00:48:09,684
Oh, I know a song.
It's called, "I give up."

1188
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,586
Or let's play the quiet game!

1189
00:48:11,721 --> 00:48:13,382
One, two, three, hush.

1190
00:48:13,518 --> 00:48:14,814
I'll tell you
what we do,

1191
00:48:14,949 --> 00:48:16,365
we go back up there
and we kick those...

1192
00:48:16,389 --> 00:48:17,858
Anger,
now is not the time.

1193
00:48:17,993 --> 00:48:19,233
Joy, this is useless.

1194
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:20,862
Real Riley is out there
somewhere,

1195
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:22,173
and we're never
going to find her.

1196
00:48:22,197 --> 00:48:23,373
You know what?
Yeah, these can go.

1197
00:48:23,397 --> 00:48:24,439
- Forget 'em!
- No, no, no, I can find her.

1198
00:48:24,463 --> 00:48:26,199
I just need to get
a better view.

1199
00:48:40,679 --> 00:48:42,951
Okay, well, this isn't
working, and that's fine.

1200
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:44,491
- Everything's fine.
- This is hopeless.

1201
00:48:44,515 --> 00:48:46,722
I say we cut our losses
and walk back.

1202
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:48,557
This whole trip
is just a series

1203
00:48:48,693 --> 00:48:50,024
of deader and deader ends.

1204
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,161
Ever since that
puberty alarm went off

1205
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:54,920
nothing around here works
the way it's supposed to!

1206
00:48:55,055 --> 00:48:57,064
I don't even recognize
this place anymore.

1207
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,265
It's light out at 1:00
in the morning!

1208
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,902
I have never been inside
so many jars in my life.

1209
00:49:03,038 --> 00:49:04,701
And the Riley we knew is gone!

1210
00:49:04,837 --> 00:49:09,341
And if Joy can't see that,
well, then, she's delusional!

1211
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:13,681
Delusional?

1212
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:16,010
Of course I'm delusional!

1213
00:49:16,145 --> 00:49:18,550
Do you know how hard it is to
stay positive all the time,

1214
00:49:18,686 --> 00:49:22,287
when all you folks do is
complain, complain, complain?

1215
00:49:22,422 --> 00:49:24,393
Jiminy mother-loving
toaster strudel!

1216
00:49:25,523 --> 00:49:27,353
Do you think
I have all the answers?

1217
00:49:27,488 --> 00:49:29,130
Of course I don't!

1218
00:49:31,466 --> 00:49:34,630
We can't even find
the back of our own mind.

1219
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:40,373
Anxiety is right!

1220
00:49:40,508 --> 00:49:44,409
Riley doesn't need us as much
as she needs them.

1221
00:49:46,781 --> 00:49:48,578
And that hurts.

1222
00:49:49,476 --> 00:49:50,679
It really hurts.

1223
00:49:55,521 --> 00:49:57,623
Joy, you've made
a lot of mistakes.

1224
00:49:57,758 --> 00:49:59,227
A lot.

1225
00:49:59,362 --> 00:50:02,328
And you'll make a whole lot
more in the future.

1226
00:50:03,164 --> 00:50:04,693
But if you let that stop you,

1227
00:50:04,828 --> 00:50:07,267
we might as well lie down
and give up now.

1228
00:50:07,403 --> 00:50:09,227
Well, actually,
that does sound kinda nice.

1229
00:50:09,363 --> 00:50:10,369
Ow!

1230
00:50:10,903 --> 00:50:12,206
Come on.

1231
00:50:18,678 --> 00:50:20,456
- Excuse us.
- Hey! You can't use that.

1232
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,744
- Riley emergency.
- Thank you!

1233
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:24,487
Hop on!

1234
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:40,674
Let's just forget
that ever happened.

1235
00:50:40,698 --> 00:50:42,128
You don't have to
ask me twice.

1236
00:50:45,808 --> 00:50:47,472
Look.

1237
00:50:51,243 --> 00:50:53,181
We're right behind you.

1238
00:51:02,188 --> 00:51:03,618
- Whoa!
- This is great.

1239
00:51:03,754 --> 00:51:05,127
The Fire Hawks
have accepted us.

1240
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:06,822
But if Coach doesn't put us
on the team,

1241
00:51:06,896 --> 00:51:07,896
none of that matters.

1242
00:51:08,029 --> 00:51:09,428
Tomorrow is everything.

1243
00:51:09,563 --> 00:51:11,725
Which is why
we're gonna need more help.

1244
00:51:11,861 --> 00:51:13,101
Ennui,
are you paying attention?

1245
00:51:13,135 --> 00:51:14,895
- No.
- Ugh. Embarrassment?

1246
00:51:15,031 --> 00:51:16,116
<i>Well,
this has been really fun.</i>

1247
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,383
Embarrassment?

1248
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:18,815
<i>- Extremely.</i>
- Never mind.

1249
00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:20,806
<i>- But we're gonna go.
- Okay, bye.</i>

1250
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:30,619
Ah!

1251
00:51:31,485 --> 00:51:32,799
Now, let's see.

1252
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:34,883
What am I looking for?

1253
00:51:35,019 --> 00:51:36,365
Don't you just hate it
when you go to do something,

1254
00:51:36,389 --> 00:51:37,466
and then
you get there to do it,

1255
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:38,700
and you forget
what you were gonna do?

1256
00:51:38,724 --> 00:51:40,364
We'll need all the help
we can get.

1257
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,230
That is exactly
what I was thinking.

1258
00:51:49,265 --> 00:51:50,271
Oh...

1259
00:51:53,641 --> 00:51:55,573
Most important game
of our lives.

1260
00:52:06,148 --> 00:52:08,288
All right, guys,
it's gonna be a long night.

1261
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,722
So let's get the team ready.

1262
00:52:14,255 --> 00:52:16,457
Come on. We just need to
cut through...

1263
00:52:16,593 --> 00:52:18,759
Imagination Land!

1264
00:52:18,894 --> 00:52:20,269
Oh, you guys
are gonna love it.

1265
00:52:20,404 --> 00:52:23,700
There's French Fry forest
and Cloud Town and...

1266
00:52:24,806 --> 00:52:25,806
Whoa!

1267
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:27,770
This place has changed.

1268
00:52:28,976 --> 00:52:31,211
Mount Crushmore?

1269
00:52:31,347 --> 00:52:32,918
Those are her top four?

1270
00:52:32,942 --> 00:52:35,149
The only one that matters
is Lance.

1271
00:52:35,284 --> 00:52:36,945
Well, at least
they got his good side.

1272
00:52:37,081 --> 00:52:39,613
Every side is his good side.

1273
00:52:39,749 --> 00:52:41,223
<i>- The Rumor Mill?</i>
- Ooh.

1274
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:42,918
Where all of our good gossip
comes from.

1275
00:52:42,992 --> 00:52:44,016
Extra, extra!

1276
00:52:44,152 --> 00:52:46,128
Pipin' hot rumors
right off the mill!

1277
00:52:46,264 --> 00:52:48,362
"The teacher's lounge
has a hot tub"?

1278
00:52:48,497 --> 00:52:51,131
"Lucy from math class
is legit psychic"?

1279
00:52:51,266 --> 00:52:52,532
"Abbie R's been
texting Mike T,

1280
00:52:52,668 --> 00:52:55,069
"but Mike T's been obsessing
over Sarah M"?

1281
00:52:55,204 --> 00:52:56,830
Where's the journalistic
integrity?

1282
00:52:56,966 --> 00:52:58,707
Oh!
Fort Pillowton's still here!

1283
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:00,407
And it even got bigger.

1284
00:53:00,908 --> 00:53:01,908
Hmm.

1285
00:53:02,042 --> 00:53:04,180
And orange?

1286
00:53:07,718 --> 00:53:09,958
<i>All right, 22,
Riley breaks her leg in practice,</i>

1287
00:53:09,987 --> 00:53:10,987
<i>disappointing everyone.</i>

1288
00:53:11,052 --> 00:53:12,087
<i>Nice job.</i>

1289
00:53:12,223 --> 00:53:13,746
<i>Now, 18.
Val and Dani whispering</i>

1290
00:53:13,882 --> 00:53:15,047
<i>after Riley misses a goal.</i>

1291
00:53:15,182 --> 00:53:17,959
<i>Great! We need to help
Riley prepare.</i>

1292
00:53:18,095 --> 00:53:19,284
<i>Now's the time to send up</i>

1293
00:53:19,419 --> 00:53:21,524
<i>every possible thing
that could go wrong.</i>

1294
00:53:21,659 --> 00:53:23,693
<i>We are looking to the future.</i>

1295
00:53:23,829 --> 00:53:25,800
<i>Every possible mistake
she could make.</i>

1296
00:53:27,363 --> 00:53:30,503
<i>Come on, 17. I'm not seeing
anything from you.</i>

1297
00:53:33,608 --> 00:53:34,949
<i>Riley misses an open goal,</i>

1298
00:53:34,973 --> 00:53:35,975
<i>Coach writes about it
in her notebook.</i>

1299
00:53:35,977 --> 00:53:36,977
<i>Yes!</i>

1300
00:53:37,045 --> 00:53:38,538
<i>More like that.</i>

1301
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:39,709
Oh, no!

1302
00:53:39,845 --> 00:53:41,679
They're using Riley's
imagination against her.

1303
00:53:41,814 --> 00:53:43,108
<i>Val and her friends
like us now,</i>

1304
00:53:43,244 --> 00:53:44,295
<i>but if we
don't make the team,</i>

1305
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,751
<i>will they like us tomorrow?</i>

1306
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:50,523
Okay,
let's go to number three.

1307
00:53:50,659 --> 00:53:52,029
Bree and Grace's team win,

1308
00:53:52,053 --> 00:53:53,627
and we look stupid.

1309
00:53:53,762 --> 00:53:57,090
Number 22. Val passes to us,
and we miss it.

1310
00:53:58,269 --> 00:53:59,868
We can't let her
do this to Riley.

1311
00:54:00,004 --> 00:54:02,236
We have to shut this down.

1312
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:04,098
<i>Love it, 37.</i>

1313
00:54:04,233 --> 00:54:07,441
<i>Riley hits the puck
into her own net.</i>

1314
00:54:07,576 --> 00:54:10,002
- Why are you drawing a hippo?
- I'm not.

1315
00:54:10,137 --> 00:54:11,355
I...
I'm drawing Riley!

1316
00:54:11,379 --> 00:54:12,805
Joy, you forgot her ponytail.

1317
00:54:12,941 --> 00:54:14,439
Oh, I love her pony tail. Yes!

1318
00:54:15,242 --> 00:54:17,115
Riley scores
and everyone hugs her?

1319
00:54:17,251 --> 00:54:18,815
81, that is not helping.

1320
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:20,784
Riley paints her nails
to match her jersey.

1321
00:54:20,919 --> 00:54:23,485
Everybody copies her.
And she is so cool.

1322
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:25,622
Riley wears knee pads.

1323
00:54:25,758 --> 00:54:28,856
We buy flowers
for the losing team!

1324
00:54:28,991 --> 00:54:31,624
What? I can't always be
the rage guy.

1325
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,065
No, no. I liked it.

1326
00:54:33,201 --> 00:54:34,662
Nail polish? Knee pads?

1327
00:54:34,798 --> 00:54:35,998
I'm starting to think you guys

1328
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:37,796
don't understand
the assignment.

1329
00:54:37,932 --> 00:54:39,005
What...

1330
00:54:42,303 --> 00:54:45,103
What? Who sent that
projection to Riley?

1331
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:46,858
- Why would I know that?
- Don't look at me.

1332
00:54:49,678 --> 00:54:50,812
What is going on?

1333
00:54:50,948 --> 00:54:53,113
Who is sending
all this positive...

1334
00:54:54,649 --> 00:54:55,918
<i>Joy.</i>

1335
00:54:56,053 --> 00:54:57,804
<i>I know you're in there.</i>

1336
00:54:57,828 --> 00:54:59,471
- Is that really her?
- Is she really here?

1337
00:54:59,495 --> 00:55:00,954
Joy from Headquarters?

1338
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:02,588
The mind police
are on their way.

1339
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,539
Well, I think we gave it
our best shot.

1340
00:55:05,563 --> 00:55:07,228
Don't listen to Anxiety.

1341
00:55:07,364 --> 00:55:10,798
She's using these horrible
projections to change Riley.

1342
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:12,767
<i>Joy, I'm doing this for you!</i>

1343
00:55:12,903 --> 00:55:14,775
This is all
so Riley can be happier.

1344
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:19,407
If you wanted her to be happy,
then you'd stop hurting her.

1345
00:55:19,543 --> 00:55:21,207
Who's with me?

1346
00:55:21,342 --> 00:55:23,510
Uh-uh.

1347
00:55:23,645 --> 00:55:25,448
Really? Nothing?

1348
00:55:25,584 --> 00:55:26,915
<i>Sorry, Joy.</i>

1349
00:55:27,051 --> 00:55:29,856
Yeah! I see you, 87.

1350
00:55:29,991 --> 00:55:31,018
A cat.

1351
00:55:31,154 --> 00:55:33,059
A little off-topic,
but I'll take it.

1352
00:55:33,194 --> 00:55:34,825
Who else? Come on!

1353
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,200
<i>What if Riley
is better than Val</i>

1354
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:37,555
<i>and then Val hates her?</i>

1355
00:55:37,691 --> 00:55:41,095
Or what if Riley is better
than Val and Val respects her?

1356
00:55:41,231 --> 00:55:42,982
Yeah! There we go!

1357
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,575
What if Riley is so bad
she has to give up hockey forever?

1358
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:50,638
What if Riley does so well
that the coach cries,

1359
00:55:50,773 --> 00:55:51,974
and the Olympics call,

1360
00:55:52,109 --> 00:55:55,007
and she rallies
a weary nation to victory?

1361
00:55:55,142 --> 00:55:57,314
Uh, Joy,
reality is also a thing.

1362
00:55:59,218 --> 00:56:00,218
No!

1363
00:56:00,314 --> 00:56:03,419
Anxiety has got you all
chained to desks,

1364
00:56:03,555 --> 00:56:04,755
drawing nightmares!

1365
00:56:04,891 --> 00:56:07,491
But you don't have to
take it anymore!

1366
00:56:07,627 --> 00:56:09,665
Pencils down! Projections off!

1367
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,800
Yeah!

1368
00:56:10,929 --> 00:56:12,449
Enough is enough!

1369
00:56:14,797 --> 00:56:16,464
My projections!

1370
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,806
Pillow fight!

1371
00:56:21,043 --> 00:56:22,334
For Riley!

1372
00:56:22,469 --> 00:56:24,578
<i>We need to be prepared.</i>

1373
00:56:27,785 --> 00:56:29,341
Oh! No!

1374
00:56:31,946 --> 00:56:33,922
Okay, it's time to go!

1375
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,182
Yeah, I think so.

1376
00:56:35,318 --> 00:56:37,525
- Bring it on, coppers!
- Oh, no, no, no.

1377
00:56:41,627 --> 00:56:42,661
Hey, get back here!

1378
00:56:42,797 --> 00:56:44,966
Quick! To the Parade
of Future Careers!

1379
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:49,263
Grab a balloon!

1380
00:56:49,398 --> 00:56:50,582
- Oh, a pastry chef!
- Underpaid!

1381
00:56:50,606 --> 00:56:52,243
- Art teacher!
- Underappreciated.

1382
00:56:52,267 --> 00:56:54,740
- Oh, ethnomusicologist!
- I don't understand

1383
00:56:54,875 --> 00:56:56,807
what that is. Oh!
Supreme Court justice!

1384
00:56:56,943 --> 00:56:57,991
- That's the one!
- I trust her judgment.

1385
00:56:58,015 --> 00:56:59,844
Get back here!

1386
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:01,820
- Move!
- They're getting away!

1387
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:07,012
Yes! Now Riley can
get some sleep.

1388
00:57:07,148 --> 00:57:09,749
I miss the jar!

1389
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:11,184
Joy doesn't get it.

1390
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,656
Without our projections,
we won't be prepared.

1391
00:57:13,792 --> 00:57:15,287
Tomorrow's game is everything.

1392
00:57:15,423 --> 00:57:16,957
Coach will either
make us a Fire Hawk

1393
00:57:17,092 --> 00:57:20,127
or doom us
to a friendless future.

1394
00:57:20,262 --> 00:57:23,297
I wish we knew what
Coach thought about us.

1395
00:57:23,432 --> 00:57:27,005
- Her notebook!
- Yes! That's a great idea!

1396
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:29,220
<i>Everything Coach thinks
about you is in there.</i>

1397
00:57:30,306 --> 00:57:32,074
All we got to do is sneak
into her office

1398
00:57:32,209 --> 00:57:33,809
and read it.

1399
00:57:37,215 --> 00:57:38,855
<i>Come on, Riley.
Move those feet.</i>

1400
00:57:39,552 --> 00:57:40,718
She doesn't want to?

1401
00:57:40,854 --> 00:57:42,390
Uh, are we pushing her
too hard?

1402
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:44,385
We got to see
what's in the notebook!

1403
00:57:44,521 --> 00:57:46,641
It's the only way for us
to know how we can do better.

1404
00:57:54,896 --> 00:57:57,104
Oh, Riley, no.

1405
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,969
Oh. Hmm.

1406
00:57:59,938 --> 00:58:01,870
Joy? Come in, Joy.

1407
00:58:02,006 --> 00:58:03,083
<i>Sadness?</i>

1408
00:58:03,107 --> 00:58:04,224
<i>Sadness, what's wrong?</i>

1409
00:58:04,248 --> 00:58:05,412
Why is Riley awake again?

1410
00:58:05,547 --> 00:58:06,847
Over.

1411
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:09,648
Anxiety is making Riley
break into the coach's office.

1412
00:58:09,784 --> 00:58:11,376
- What?
- She knows better than that.

1413
00:58:11,511 --> 00:58:14,048
She will once we get her
Sense of Self back.

1414
00:58:14,183 --> 00:58:16,454
Sadness,
you have to stop her.

1415
00:58:16,589 --> 00:58:18,418
<i>Just don't get caught.</i>

1416
00:58:19,154 --> 00:58:20,353
<i>Over!</i>

1417
00:58:31,899 --> 00:58:33,102
Psst.

1418
00:58:33,768 --> 00:58:35,401
Psst!

1419
00:59:10,073 --> 00:59:12,471
No, Riley, no.

1420
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,686
Oh!

1421
00:59:30,794 --> 00:59:31,794
Why did she stop?

1422
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,795
Sadness?

1423
00:59:33,931 --> 00:59:35,263
Ennui! Where's your phone?

1424
00:59:35,398 --> 00:59:37,604
Ooh, la, la, my phone?
Where is my phone?

1425
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,700
Seriously?
This is not happening!

1426
00:59:39,835 --> 00:59:41,006
No, no, no!

1427
00:59:41,141 --> 00:59:43,601
Okay, she's got to be here
somewhere. Find her.

1428
00:59:44,271 --> 00:59:45,471
Gotcha!

1429
01:00:01,922 --> 01:00:03,054
Sadness.

1430
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:05,998
Uh... No.

1431
01:00:06,133 --> 01:00:09,368
I know Riley
sneaking around feels wrong.

1432
01:00:09,504 --> 01:00:11,570
This isn't who Riley is.

1433
01:00:11,705 --> 01:00:14,036
It's not about who Riley is.

1434
01:00:14,171 --> 01:00:16,645
It's about
who she needs to be.

1435
01:00:30,724 --> 01:00:32,855
"Not ready yet"?

1436
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:35,659
Wait. Coach already decided?

1437
01:00:35,795 --> 01:00:36,957
We're not making the team?

1438
01:00:37,093 --> 01:00:39,158
No. We have one day left.

1439
01:00:39,294 --> 01:00:40,767
What do we do? What can we do?

1440
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:42,312
- Okay, okay, okay.
- What would Val do?

1441
01:00:42,336 --> 01:00:45,297
Uh, well, we're just gonna
have to change Coach's mind.

1442
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:47,273
Which means
we're gonna need ideas.

1443
01:00:47,409 --> 01:00:48,301
Lots of them.

1444
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,209
Ow!

1445
01:00:55,309 --> 01:00:58,179
Oh, no. It's a Brainstorm!

1446
01:00:58,315 --> 01:01:00,447
Too close!

1447
01:01:01,522 --> 01:01:02,884
Hog the puck?

1448
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:05,221
Trash talk the other team?

1449
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,555
- Ooh!
- Yes!

1450
01:01:11,562 --> 01:01:14,593
We can't let these bad ideas
get to Riley.

1451
01:01:14,929 --> 01:01:15,929
Joy!

1452
01:01:17,873 --> 01:01:20,236
- Smash as many as you can!
- Joy!

1453
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:22,870
Joy!

1454
01:01:28,547 --> 01:01:31,116
I'll start sorting these into
ideas I wish I'd thought of.

1455
01:01:31,251 --> 01:01:33,452
Oh, no, no, no.
None of these are good enough.

1456
01:01:33,588 --> 01:01:35,552
We need more. Get more!

1457
01:01:37,592 --> 01:01:39,259
Get on the balloon!

1458
01:01:39,394 --> 01:01:41,361
Whoa!

1459
01:01:43,459 --> 01:01:45,629
This is worse
than the broccoli!

1460
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,305
Quick! Grab an idea.

1461
01:01:53,205 --> 01:01:55,607
- Whoa!
- These ideas are too small.

1462
01:01:55,743 --> 01:01:57,004
These ideas are too small!

1463
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:59,011
We need something bigger.

1464
01:02:02,947 --> 01:02:04,383
That's our way out!

1465
01:02:09,885 --> 01:02:11,089
Ready?

1466
01:02:18,061 --> 01:02:20,195
Joy! We need this idea!

1467
01:02:20,331 --> 01:02:21,651
If Riley takes
one of these ideas,

1468
01:02:21,735 --> 01:02:22,998
it could be a disaster!

1469
01:02:23,133 --> 01:02:25,400
Joy, the only way out is up.

1470
01:02:40,181 --> 01:02:41,717
That's a big idea!

1471
01:02:41,852 --> 01:02:44,392
Whoa! I like it.

1472
01:02:44,528 --> 01:02:46,421
Oh, no.

1473
01:02:50,497 --> 01:02:52,130
Hold me!

1474
01:02:52,265 --> 01:02:54,133
Seriously. Hold me!

1475
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:58,635
Fear,
you have a parachute?

1476
01:02:58,770 --> 01:02:59,907
Uh, yes.

1477
01:03:00,043 --> 01:03:01,723
The real question is,
why don't any of you?

1478
01:03:03,044 --> 01:03:05,109
- Land! Yes!
- Yes!

1479
01:03:05,245 --> 01:03:06,805
- Stuck the landing!
- We did it!

1480
01:03:06,882 --> 01:03:07,924
We made it!

1481
01:03:07,948 --> 01:03:10,011
Come on,
to the Back of the Mind!

1482
01:03:10,147 --> 01:03:12,315
You're finished, Anxiety!

1483
01:03:15,056 --> 01:03:16,891
Coach is right.
Riley isn't ready.

1484
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:20,561
But we're so close
to a new Riley who is.

1485
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:22,229
This is what we're missing.

1486
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:26,865
We show them we're a Fire Hawk
who will do whatever it takes.

1487
01:03:48,218 --> 01:03:50,756
Finally, we're one of them!

1488
01:03:50,891 --> 01:03:52,120
What do you think, Sadness?

1489
01:03:52,256 --> 01:03:53,728
- Well, I...
- Awesome!

1490
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:55,230
<i>Red is really our color.</i>

1491
01:03:55,365 --> 01:03:56,387
Yeah, no,

1492
01:03:56,523 --> 01:03:57,690
I mean, it's so much fun.

1493
01:04:03,567 --> 01:04:06,267
Okay, it's giving jealousy.
I'm sorry.

1494
01:04:06,402 --> 01:04:07,642
They wouldn't know cool

1495
01:04:07,776 --> 01:04:09,105
if it hit them in the face.

1496
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:10,775
Hey, Michigan.

1497
01:04:10,911 --> 01:04:13,140
Oh! Rocking the red, huh?

1498
01:04:13,276 --> 01:04:15,209
- Yes!
- We are in.

1499
01:04:15,344 --> 01:04:16,918
I hope it's okay.

1500
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:18,525
I know I'm not officially
a Fire Hawk yet,

1501
01:04:18,549 --> 01:04:20,126
but I figured since we're
on the same team

1502
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:21,389
we should match, right?

1503
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:22,557
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

1504
01:04:22,693 --> 01:04:24,054
Did you, um, sleep last night?

1505
01:04:24,189 --> 01:04:26,484
No, how could I?
Big game today!

1506
01:04:26,619 --> 01:04:27,961
You mean the camp scrimmage?

1507
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:30,361
See? I told you
not to freak her out.

1508
01:04:30,496 --> 01:04:32,798
You're all good, okay?
I see you're in your zone.

1509
01:04:32,934 --> 01:04:34,764
Get ready to score some goals.

1510
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,200
Yeah! I will!

1511
01:04:36,335 --> 01:04:37,901
Val scored two goals
in the scrimmage

1512
01:04:38,036 --> 01:04:39,036
to become a Fire Hawk.

1513
01:04:39,172 --> 01:04:40,837
And you know
what's better than two?

1514
01:04:40,972 --> 01:04:41,972
- Three!
- Three!

1515
01:04:42,042 --> 01:04:43,202
I was just about to say that.

1516
01:04:43,311 --> 01:04:44,914
We were about to say that
at the same time.

1517
01:04:44,938 --> 01:04:47,882
But how are we gonna score
three goals?

1518
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:49,982
The new Riley
will handle anything.

1519
01:04:50,118 --> 01:04:53,053
And I think this
is the finishing touch.

1520
01:04:56,054 --> 01:04:57,321
I'll be right back.

1521
01:05:02,563 --> 01:05:03,665
Come on!

1522
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,156
We're so close.

1523
01:05:05,291 --> 01:05:07,628
The Sense of Self is just
on top of that mount...

1524
01:05:11,739 --> 01:05:13,074
That is a lot.

1525
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:15,707
This is more than I remember
sending back here.

1526
01:05:15,843 --> 01:05:17,042
Oh, when she walked into

1527
01:05:17,178 --> 01:05:18,837
that glass door at that party.
Oof!

1528
01:05:18,973 --> 01:05:21,279
Yeah, and breaking
Grandma's favorite plate.

1529
01:05:21,414 --> 01:05:23,378
Thank goodness
these aren't part of her.

1530
01:05:23,514 --> 01:05:25,419
- Phew!
- Oh, yeah.

1531
01:05:38,096 --> 01:05:40,265
There it is.

1532
01:05:46,209 --> 01:05:49,408
<i>I'm a good person.</i>

1533
01:05:49,544 --> 01:05:50,544
Oh, no.

1534
01:06:00,613 --> 01:06:02,353
Yes. Come on, come on.

1535
01:06:02,822 --> 01:06:04,520
Here we go!

1536
01:06:06,327 --> 01:06:07,727
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1537
01:06:09,223 --> 01:06:10,195
What?

1538
01:06:10,196 --> 01:06:12,798
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1539
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:16,004
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1540
01:06:17,537 --> 01:06:19,337
Are you sure...

1541
01:06:19,399 --> 01:06:20,636
Don't worry.

1542
01:06:20,772 --> 01:06:21,534
It's just that she knows that
there's always room

1543
01:06:21,535 --> 01:06:22,535
for self-improvement.

1544
01:06:22,644 --> 01:06:23,644
She'll be fine.

1545
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:27,748
Sadness,
we have the Sense of Self.

1546
01:06:27,884 --> 01:06:28,964
<i>Bring us back!</i>

1547
01:06:29,008 --> 01:06:30,488
<i>Sadness, do you copy?</i>

1548
01:06:31,048 --> 01:06:32,680
Psst. Psst!

1549
01:06:34,047 --> 01:06:36,090
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1550
01:06:40,991 --> 01:06:42,195
Oh...

1551
01:06:44,999 --> 01:06:46,458
Okay, I can work with this.

1552
01:06:46,594 --> 01:06:47,661
I just need to recalibrate

1553
01:06:47,797 --> 01:06:48,978
the console and make sure
it's ready.

1554
01:06:49,002 --> 01:06:50,601
Just no more surprises.

1555
01:06:51,404 --> 01:06:53,038
Okay, this one goes here.
Check.

1556
01:06:53,173 --> 01:06:54,468
That one goes there.
Check.

1557
01:06:54,603 --> 01:06:55,909
Not exactly there.
Here.

1558
01:06:56,044 --> 01:06:57,340
Come on.
Turn it up a little bit.

1559
01:06:57,476 --> 01:06:59,070
It's got to be
absolutely perfect.

1560
01:06:59,205 --> 01:07:01,115
That one is definitely wrong.
What is happening?

1561
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:02,730
<i>Sadness, now!</i>

1562
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:13,952
Oh...

1563
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:15,321
Joy...

1564
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:16,861
- Oh, no!
- Uh...

1565
01:07:35,042 --> 01:07:38,216
<i>I'm a good person.</i>

1566
01:07:38,352 --> 01:07:40,550
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1567
01:07:44,223 --> 01:07:45,850
That was our only way back.

1568
01:07:45,986 --> 01:07:48,096
- What do we do?
- We were so close.

1569
01:07:56,969 --> 01:07:58,238
Joy. Joy!

1570
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:00,273
Where are you going?

1571
01:08:16,224 --> 01:08:17,615
<i>Twenty-eight!</i>

1572
01:08:17,751 --> 01:08:19,226
<i>Andersen, tripping!</i>

1573
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:23,205
<i>Twenty-eight!</i>

1574
01:08:23,229 --> 01:08:24,397
<i>Andersen, tripping!</i>

1575
01:08:30,436 --> 01:08:31,711
<i>Twenty-eight!</i>

1576
01:08:31,735 --> 01:08:32,935
<i>Andersen, tripping!</i>

1577
01:08:34,903 --> 01:08:37,310
<i>I expected better, Riley.</i>

1578
01:08:40,442 --> 01:08:41,578
That's not...

1579
01:08:47,386 --> 01:08:48,706
What...

1580
01:08:55,621 --> 01:08:57,561
Come on, please.

1581
01:08:58,999 --> 01:09:00,531
What am I missing?

1582
01:09:05,902 --> 01:09:09,105
<i>I'm a good person.</i>

1583
01:09:16,410 --> 01:09:17,482
Joy...

1584
01:09:18,184 --> 01:09:20,551
so what do we do now?

1585
01:09:29,062 --> 01:09:30,627
I don't know.

1586
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:34,664
I don't know
how to stop Anxiety.

1587
01:09:37,498 --> 01:09:39,064
Maybe we can't.

1588
01:09:40,707 --> 01:09:43,706
Maybe this is what happens
when you grow up.

1589
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,281
You feel less joy.

1590
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:55,487
But I do know this.

1591
01:09:58,588 --> 01:10:00,492
Riley will never be herself

1592
01:10:00,627 --> 01:10:03,022
if we don't get this
back to Headquarters.

1593
01:10:03,391 --> 01:10:04,562
Fast.

1594
01:10:06,196 --> 01:10:07,202
How?

1595
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:12,504
Have a good game, Riley.

1596
01:10:12,906 --> 01:10:14,099
You too.

1597
01:10:16,346 --> 01:10:17,746
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1598
01:10:22,445 --> 01:10:23,449
Whoa!

1599
01:10:24,677 --> 01:10:27,011
Yes! Go, go, go!

1600
01:10:27,147 --> 01:10:29,719
Riley, I'm open.
Pass it, pass it!

1601
01:10:29,854 --> 01:10:31,292
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1602
01:10:36,297 --> 01:10:38,098
Yeah, Michigan!

1603
01:10:38,233 --> 01:10:39,999
Leave some
for the rest of us, huh?

1604
01:10:40,135 --> 01:10:42,535
Yes! One down, two to go.

1605
01:10:42,671 --> 01:10:44,631
Okay, so how do we
get our Sense of Self

1606
01:10:44,666 --> 01:10:46,406
from here to there?

1607
01:10:48,335 --> 01:10:51,978
I have an idea,
but I really don't like it.

1608
01:10:52,113 --> 01:10:54,172
Anger, Riley needs us.

1609
01:10:56,313 --> 01:10:58,785
Oh, Pouchy!

1610
01:11:00,622 --> 01:11:04,285
Well, what are you
waiting for? Say the words!

1611
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:06,386
Oh, Pouchy!

1612
01:11:12,926 --> 01:11:15,129
Hi, everybody. I'm Pouchy!

1613
01:11:15,265 --> 01:11:16,403
We know.

1614
01:11:16,539 --> 01:11:17,845
Pouchy, we need to
get back to Headquarters.

1615
01:11:17,869 --> 01:11:19,500
Do you have anything
that can help us?

1616
01:11:19,635 --> 01:11:21,166
I have lots of items.

1617
01:11:21,301 --> 01:11:23,601
Which one do you think
will work the best?

1618
01:11:23,736 --> 01:11:24,938
A roll of tape,

1619
01:11:25,073 --> 01:11:27,147
- a rubber ducky...
- No time!

1620
01:11:27,282 --> 01:11:28,813
Huh?

1621
01:11:28,949 --> 01:11:29,949
Hmm.

1622
01:11:30,009 --> 01:11:31,946
Seriously, Pouchy? Dynamite?

1623
01:11:32,081 --> 01:11:33,978
Don't you have, like,
a jetpack or a plane

1624
01:11:34,114 --> 01:11:35,391
or something
that's going to help us?

1625
01:11:35,415 --> 01:11:37,191
What do you think,
I have everything in here?

1626
01:11:37,327 --> 01:11:38,958
I offered you
the rubber ducky,

1627
01:11:39,094 --> 01:11:40,094
I offered you the tape.

1628
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:41,219
I know what to do.

1629
01:11:41,354 --> 01:11:43,498
But we're gonna need
a lot more dynamite.

1630
01:11:44,401 --> 01:11:46,563
You know what? Good luck...

1631
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:51,729
<i>Come on, Riley.
Get the puck!</i>

1632
01:11:51,864 --> 01:11:53,198
Take it, take it!

1633
01:11:54,906 --> 01:11:56,535
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1634
01:11:57,807 --> 01:11:59,479
Michigan, what are you doing?

1635
01:12:00,148 --> 01:12:01,712
We're on the same team!

1636
01:12:08,516 --> 01:12:10,017
Yes!

1637
01:12:10,152 --> 01:12:12,317
Well, Dani might be
a little mad at us,

1638
01:12:12,452 --> 01:12:14,523
but they'll all forgive us
when we make the team.

1639
01:12:14,659 --> 01:12:17,189
Come on, Riley. One more goal.

1640
01:12:21,427 --> 01:12:23,170
Uh... Hold on, Joy.
We're gonna

1641
01:12:23,305 --> 01:12:25,073
- blow up this cliff?
- Yep!

1642
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:27,132
And then
we'll ride an avalanche

1643
01:12:27,268 --> 01:12:28,742
of bad memories
back to Headquarters?

1644
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:29,877
Yeah!

1645
01:12:30,006 --> 01:12:31,506
And how do we
keep the bad memories

1646
01:12:31,642 --> 01:12:32,912
from forming bad beliefs?

1647
01:12:33,048 --> 01:12:35,008
I don't know.

1648
01:12:35,144 --> 01:12:38,312
Um, yeah! What could go wrong?
I'm in!

1649
01:12:38,447 --> 01:12:39,516
Ready?

1650
01:12:39,651 --> 01:12:40,691
- For Riley.
- Let's do it.

1651
01:12:40,782 --> 01:12:42,687
Here we come, Riley.

1652
01:12:56,597 --> 01:12:57,603
Jump on!

1653
01:13:22,627 --> 01:13:24,190
Come on!

1654
01:13:24,724 --> 01:13:25,724
Aw, man!

1655
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:28,928
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1656
01:13:29,063 --> 01:13:30,795
<i>You have to score!</i>

1657
01:13:40,175 --> 01:13:43,310
Andersen,
penalty box, two minutes.

1658
01:13:43,446 --> 01:13:44,809
No!

1659
01:13:44,945 --> 01:13:46,652
Grace, are you okay?

1660
01:13:50,653 --> 01:13:51,689
We hurt Grace.

1661
01:13:51,825 --> 01:13:54,561
It all happened so fast.
I didn't even see her.

1662
01:14:01,098 --> 01:14:02,597
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1663
01:14:02,732 --> 01:14:04,334
Oh, no. What did I do?

1664
01:14:06,634 --> 01:14:07,640
No, no.

1665
01:14:08,739 --> 01:14:10,071
I can fix it, I can fix it.

1666
01:14:49,244 --> 01:14:51,310
<i>I expected better, Riley.</i>

1667
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:53,411
Wait... No!

1668
01:14:54,453 --> 01:14:55,985
Come on.

1669
01:14:57,055 --> 01:14:58,592
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1670
01:14:59,193 --> 01:15:00,455
Come on, Riley.

1671
01:15:00,590 --> 01:15:01,694
Get it together.

1672
01:15:01,829 --> 01:15:03,401
Come on, Riley,
get it together.

1673
01:15:03,425 --> 01:15:05,345
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1674
01:15:06,126 --> 01:15:08,265
You have to score, Riley!

1675
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,394
Or this will all

1676
01:15:09,395 --> 01:15:10,739
have been for nothing!

1677
01:15:10,763 --> 01:15:12,678
Anxiety, you're putting
too much pressure on her.

1678
01:15:30,791 --> 01:15:33,022
Okay,
let's take a breather!

1679
01:15:43,263 --> 01:15:45,973
- Sadness!
- Joy! Help!

1680
01:15:47,738 --> 01:15:49,577
Come on! We can do this!

1681
01:15:50,542 --> 01:15:51,836
It's not working!

1682
01:15:51,972 --> 01:15:53,240
It's Anxiety.

1683
01:16:10,266 --> 01:16:13,161
Anxiety, stop!

1684
01:16:18,299 --> 01:16:21,136
You don't get to choose
who Riley is.

1685
01:16:27,006 --> 01:16:28,275
Anxiety...

1686
01:16:33,553 --> 01:16:35,216
you need to let her go.

1687
01:16:59,077 --> 01:17:01,276
<i>I'm a good person.</i>

1688
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:13,360
Joy.

1689
01:17:13,987 --> 01:17:15,421
I'm sorry.

1690
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:19,524
I was just
trying to protect her.

1691
01:17:21,127 --> 01:17:23,131
But you're right.

1692
01:17:23,266 --> 01:17:27,136
We don't get to choose
who Riley is.

1693
01:17:31,538 --> 01:17:35,441
We keep the best
and toss the rest.

1694
01:17:47,894 --> 01:17:48,935
<i>Twenty-eight!</i>

1695
01:17:48,959 --> 01:17:49,959
<i>Andersen, tripping!</i>

1696
01:18:13,514 --> 01:18:15,448
<i>I'm a good person.</i>

1697
01:18:22,827 --> 01:18:24,128
Joy! What are you doing?

1698
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:37,206
<i>I'm selfish.</i>

1699
01:18:38,347 --> 01:18:39,505
<i>I'm kind.</i>

1700
01:18:40,846 --> 01:18:42,673
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1701
01:18:43,716 --> 01:18:45,378
<i>I'm a good person.</i>

1702
01:18:45,514 --> 01:18:47,755
<i>I need to fit in...</i>

1703
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:50,018
<i>...but I want to be myself.</i>

1704
01:18:50,153 --> 01:18:52,187
<i>I'm brave, but I get scared.</i>

1705
01:18:52,323 --> 01:18:54,154
<i>Success is everything.
I make mistakes.</i>

1706
01:18:54,290 --> 01:18:55,560
<i>I'm nice.
I'm mean.</i>

1707
01:18:55,695 --> 01:18:56,695
<i>I'm a good friend.</i>

1708
01:18:56,799 --> 01:18:57,842
<i>I'm a terrible friend.
I am strong.</i>

1709
01:18:57,866 --> 01:19:00,196
<i>I'm weak.
I need help sometimes.</i>

1710
01:19:58,657 --> 01:20:01,191
Riley, you okay?

1711
01:20:09,535 --> 01:20:10,732
Yeah.

1712
01:20:10,868 --> 01:20:13,401
I mean... no.

1713
01:20:16,910 --> 01:20:20,312
I was such a jerk to you guys.

1714
01:20:20,447 --> 01:20:23,349
When you guys told me you were
going to a different school,

1715
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:24,647
I freaked out.

1716
01:20:24,783 --> 01:20:26,645
And...

1717
01:20:28,655 --> 01:20:30,055
I'm so sorry.

1718
01:20:32,423 --> 01:20:34,554
If you don't want to
be friends anymore...

1719
01:20:35,826 --> 01:20:37,029
I get it.

1720
01:20:37,827 --> 01:20:38,931
But...

1721
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:41,330
I really hope that
you can forgive me.

1722
01:20:42,667 --> 01:20:43,728
Someday.

1723
01:21:11,395 --> 01:21:12,743
- Let's go, ladies!
- Come on.

1724
01:21:12,767 --> 01:21:14,429
We've got a game to finish.

1725
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:44,529
Joy...

1726
01:21:44,664 --> 01:21:46,692
Riley wants you.

1727
01:22:21,966 --> 01:22:23,168
Riley!

1728
01:23:07,373 --> 01:23:08,378
Yes!

1729
01:23:09,013 --> 01:23:10,013
Whoo!

1730
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:31,665
Hey, Minnesota,

1731
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:32,881
how long are you gonna
stare at your phone?

1732
01:23:32,905 --> 01:23:34,140
It's almost 2:00.

1733
01:23:34,275 --> 01:23:35,966
Coach is gonna post
the list any minute.

1734
01:23:36,102 --> 01:23:38,376
- Okay. 2:00 p.m. That's in...
- Six minutes.

1735
01:23:38,511 --> 01:23:40,049
And what happens if we don't
become a Fire Hawk?

1736
01:23:40,073 --> 01:23:42,973
Well, thanks for asking, Joy.
I'll tell you.

1737
01:23:43,108 --> 01:23:44,748
First, Mom and Dad
are very disappointed.

1738
01:23:44,883 --> 01:23:45,976
We don't go pro,

1739
01:23:46,111 --> 01:23:47,397
and we find work
as an ethnomusicologist...

1740
01:23:47,421 --> 01:23:48,562
even though we don't
really know what that is.

1741
01:23:48,586 --> 01:23:50,614
We have no friends,
and we die alone.

1742
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:51,957
Okay, okay.

1743
01:23:52,093 --> 01:23:53,955
None of that
is happening right now.

1744
01:23:54,090 --> 01:23:55,427
- Is it?
- No.

1745
01:23:55,563 --> 01:23:58,164
Great! So why don't we take
a seat in our special chair.

1746
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:00,798
Yeah, that's a great idea.

1747
01:24:00,934 --> 01:24:02,168
See? Isn't that better?

1748
01:24:02,303 --> 01:24:04,567
Oh, yeah,
that's the stuff.

1749
01:24:04,702 --> 01:24:06,969
We can't control whether Riley
makes the team.

1750
01:24:07,105 --> 01:24:08,667
But what can we control?

1751
01:24:08,803 --> 01:24:10,179
Well, um... Oh!

1752
01:24:10,203 --> 01:24:12,403
Riley has a Spanish test
tomorrow. We need to study.

1753
01:24:12,538 --> 01:24:13,538
Oh! You're right.

1754
01:24:13,576 --> 01:24:14,656
- We totally...
<i>- Olvidamos!</i>

1755
01:24:14,775 --> 01:24:16,149
- What's that mean?
- "Forgot."

1756
01:24:16,284 --> 01:24:17,492
Someone paid attention
in class.

1757
01:24:17,516 --> 01:24:18,925
I never would've
thought of that.

1758
01:24:18,949 --> 01:24:19,687
- You're clearly an expert.
<i>- Muchas gracias.</i>

1759
01:24:19,688 --> 01:24:20,688
Oh, thanks, guys.

1760
01:24:20,746 --> 01:24:21,779
Plus, we followed our new

1761
01:24:21,915 --> 01:24:24,021
varsity caliber
training program.

1762
01:24:24,157 --> 01:24:25,592
Oh, I wish I thought of that.

1763
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,093
Newsflash, you did!

1764
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:28,985
Wait, you're right, I did.

1765
01:24:29,121 --> 01:24:31,523
I'm jealous of myself.
Thanks for the reminder.

1766
01:24:31,658 --> 01:24:32,792
You're welcome!

1767
01:24:32,928 --> 01:24:35,130
- Who said that?
- It's my new buddy, Pouchy.

1768
01:24:35,266 --> 01:24:37,100
Hi, everybody. I'm Pouchy!

1769
01:24:37,236 --> 01:24:38,896
Confetti if we make the team!

1770
01:24:39,031 --> 01:24:40,570
Good idea. Ah!

1771
01:24:40,705 --> 01:24:43,138
That's great, but either way,
we love our girl.

1772
01:24:43,273 --> 01:24:44,670
Confetti if we don't!

1773
01:24:47,607 --> 01:24:49,080
Oh, is it Coach's email?

1774
01:24:49,215 --> 01:24:51,651
No. It's Bree and Grace.

1775
01:24:51,787 --> 01:24:54,086
Aw. I miss those girls.

1776
01:24:54,222 --> 01:24:56,749
Oh. Remember when
Bree and Grace,

1777
01:24:56,885 --> 01:24:58,268
- and us used to...
- You're still early.

1778
01:24:58,292 --> 01:24:59,892
- No, no, no. Too early.
- Go downstairs.

1779
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,522
I'll just be downstairs
if you need me.

1780
01:25:02,657 --> 01:25:04,020
<i>It's 3 minutes to 2:00.</i>

1781
01:25:04,156 --> 01:25:06,465
- She's got this.
- 'Cause she's got us.

1782
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:12,134
Ooh, yeah! Right? 'Cause
she's... Maybe?

1783
01:25:12,270 --> 01:25:13,864
All right, Embarrassment.

1784
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,066
Everybody,
look at Embarrassment!

1785
01:25:18,004 --> 01:25:19,977
Hey, look, if you don't
make it this year,

1786
01:25:20,113 --> 01:25:21,381
there's always next year.

1787
01:25:21,517 --> 01:25:22,808
I know.

1788
01:25:22,944 --> 01:25:25,378
- I love our girl.
- How could you not?

1789
01:25:25,513 --> 01:25:26,920
<i>She's super smart.</i>

1790
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:28,351
<i>And great at hockey.</i>

1791
01:25:28,487 --> 01:25:29,881
<i>She's really creative.</i>

1792
01:25:30,016 --> 01:25:32,282
She can be bored,
but never boring.

1793
01:25:32,417 --> 01:25:35,118
But she can be a little
sarcastic from time to time.

1794
01:25:35,254 --> 01:25:38,157
<i>She can have
really bad ideas.</i>

1795
01:25:38,292 --> 01:25:41,159
<i>Occasionally, she can
do the wrong thing.</i>

1796
01:25:41,294 --> 01:25:44,435
<i>And sometimes, she can be
too hard on herself.</i>

1797
01:25:44,571 --> 01:25:48,040
<i>But every bit of Riley
makes her who she is.</i>

1798
01:25:48,175 --> 01:25:50,540
<i>And we love all of our girl.</i>

1799
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:55,641
<i>Every messy,
beautiful piece of her.</i>

1800
01:26:24,671 --> 01:26:27,612
So, Riley, how was camp?

1801
01:26:27,747 --> 01:26:30,616
Okay, we talked about this.
We tell them everything.

1802
01:26:30,751 --> 01:26:31,916
Uh...

1803
01:26:32,052 --> 01:26:33,243
But what about sneaking

1804
01:26:33,378 --> 01:26:34,463
- into Coach's office?
- What about hitting Grace?

1805
01:26:34,487 --> 01:26:35,387
- Remember the lying?
- Are we gonna

1806
01:26:35,388 --> 01:26:36,532
tell her about the Fire Hawks?

1807
01:26:36,556 --> 01:26:38,068
- She doesn't need to know.
- Objection.

1808
01:26:38,092 --> 01:26:39,351
<i>Pardon. Excusez moi.</i>

1809
01:26:40,586 --> 01:26:41,591
It was good.

1810
01:26:43,489 --> 01:26:46,792
She goes away for three days
and all we get is, "good"?

1811
01:26:46,928 --> 01:26:48,143
And what about
the red in her hair?

1812
01:26:48,167 --> 01:26:49,363
Did she join a gang?

1813
01:26:49,498 --> 01:26:51,062
Welcome back, Anxiety.

1814
01:26:52,575 --> 01:26:56,836
She goes away for three days
and all we get is, "good"?

1815
01:26:56,972 --> 01:26:59,236
Yeah. Sounds right.
Back to the game.

1816
01:26:59,371 --> 01:27:01,211
<i>With a nice pass
over to Reeves,</i>

1817
01:27:01,346 --> 01:27:02,942
<i>comes across center ice.</i>

1818
01:27:03,077 --> 01:27:05,546
<i>Down to the line.
Oh, what a move!</i>

1819
01:34:45,545 --> 01:34:47,905
Okay, Deep Dark Secret.

1820
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:49,245
It's time.

1821
01:34:50,715 --> 01:34:54,252
It's okay. Come on.

1822
01:34:56,556 --> 01:34:58,851
Okay. Let it go, buddy.

1823
01:34:58,986 --> 01:35:00,386
What's the secret?

1824
01:35:02,595 --> 01:35:05,561
We burn hole in rug.

1825
01:35:05,697 --> 01:35:07,429
Really? That's it? Whew!

1826
01:35:07,564 --> 01:35:09,964
I thought you were gonna say
the time we peed in the pool.

1827
01:35:10,099 --> 01:35:12,398
Oh, no, wait.

1828
01:35:14,474 --> 01:35:15,632
And he's gone.
