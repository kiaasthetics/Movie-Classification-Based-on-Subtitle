1
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,059
Our story begins
high over New York City...

2
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,811
in the luxurious
penthouse apartment...

3
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,356
of perhaps
the most unlikely genius
the world has ever known.

4
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,152
Oh. Sorry. You caught me
doing my yoga.

5
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,319
You were expecting

6
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,155
downward dog,
perhaps?

7
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,825
My name is Mr. Peabody.

8
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,994
And since we're going to be
spending some time together...

9
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:20,204
I'd like to tell you
a little bit about myself.

10
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,692
You see,
ever since I was a pup...

11
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,541
it was clear that
I was different.

12
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,044
I tried
to fit in...

13
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,171
No, thank you.

14
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,881
...but never could.

15
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,675
As I grew,
I saw more and more
of my littermates...

16
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,720
being chosen by
their new families.

17
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,348
But for some reason,
I never was.

18
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,352
Come on, boy!
Fetch the stick!

19
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,897
But why? Won't you
just throw it again?

20
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,357
It's an exercise in futility.

21
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:51,027
I don't want this one,
Mommy. He's sarcastic.

22
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:53,196
Wait, wait!
Come back!
Throw the stick.

23
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,073
I'll stay, I'll heel,
I'll even shake hands.

24
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,784
Bark, bark?

25
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,120
So, without
a family of my own...

26
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,748
I dedicated myself to
the pursuit of knowledge...

27
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,375
culture, and athletics.

28
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:10,087
I received my degree at Harvard.

29
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,089
Vale-dog-torian, of course.

30
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,216
Yay!

31
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,219
And then,
I devoted myself
to helping mankind.

32
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,055
I pioneered new techniques
in alternative energy.

33
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:22,391
Yay!

34
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:25,061
Resolved
geopolitical conflicts
around the globe.

35
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,482
And in my spare time...

36
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,151
I invented
the fist bump, planking,
tearaway pants...

37
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,319
Auto-Tune...

38
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,612
the backside ollie...

39
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:35,780
and Zumba.

40
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,406
Now go

41
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:38,991
Stop

42
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,535
Drop

43
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,537
Pause

44
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,833
But what I'm most proud of
is my son, Sherman.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,085
Hi, Mr. Peabody.

46
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,630
Oh!  Have you
told them about the WABAC?

47
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,091
I was
just getting to that.

48
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,594
When I adopted Sherman,
I vowed to be
the best father I could be.

49
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,055
To prepare him for all
the wonders of the world,

50
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,765
present and past.

51
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:07,270
And so, Sherman
inspired the greatest
invention of my life...

52
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,273
a time machine.

53
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:20,199
Of course, time travel
can be a bit unpredictable.

54
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:23,035
There are bound to be
a few mishaps along the way.

55
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,620
Let's just say,
the Leaning Tower of Pisa

56
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,539
wasn't always leaning.

57
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:27,832
But there's
nothing like learning

58
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,083
the lessons of
history firsthand.

59
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,209
Right, Sherman?

60
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:32,169
Where are we going
today, Mr. Peabody?

61
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,796
Not "where," Sherman.

62
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,798
"When."

63
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,731
Whoa! This is
the biggest house
I've ever seen!

64
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,859
It's the Palace
of Versailles, home
of Marie Antoinette.

65
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:57,486
You know,
she was mostly
famous for one thing.

66
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,863
Cake!

67
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:02,325
I love cake so much.

68
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,206
Marie Antoinette
sure likes cake,
Mr. Peabody.

69
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,499
Oh!
Indeed she does.

70
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,501
Marie was a woman
with a prodigious
appetite...

71
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,670
for all things
covered with frosting.

72
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:18,007
But her expensive tastes
made her the target
of much criticism.

73
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,842
Why?
Because, Sherman...

74
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,530
during Marie's reign,
the common people

75
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,179
of France were exceedingly poor.

76
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,181
You've got any bread?

77
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:28,184
No! I'm exceedingly poor.

78
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,186
Now, can we have some cake?

79
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:31,354
Mais, oui.

80
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,023
Oh, yeah, sorry.

81
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,691
"May we" have some cake?

82
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,026
Mais, oui!

83
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,127
Maybe she can't hear me
through the hair.

84
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,405
Sherman, what
the queen means is...

85
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,492
Ah!
Let them eat cake!

86
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,706
When the queen
heard the poor of Paris
could not even buy bread...

87
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,209
she said,
"Let them eat cake."

88
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,168
No!

89
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,461
I heard it myself.

90
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:56,837
It's a scandal!
It's an outrage!

91
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,047
Down with the queen!

92
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,131
Down with the monarchy!

93
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,591
Wait!

94
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,385
What kind of cake?

95
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,103
Smashing party, Your Majesty.

96
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,981
But now, I'm afraid
Sherman and I must be...

97
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,400
Sherman? Sherman?

98
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,276
Sherman!

99
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,905
Sherman?

100
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:27,743
Sherman! Here,
Sherman.

101
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,578
Hey, Mr. Peabody.

102
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,455
What are you doing in here?

103
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:32,832
Trying these other cakes.

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,336
There's one in here
with whipped cream and
strawberries that's...

105
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,005
pretty fantastic!

106
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,256
Sherman...

107
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,258
don't you remember
why I told you to stay

108
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,260
close to me during
the French Revolution?

109
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:46,137
Because after
the French Revolution...

110
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,930
it was gonna rain?
Close.

111
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,433
I said, "After the
French Revolution comes...

112
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,727
the Reign of Terror!"

113
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:01,110
Round up the aristocrats.

114
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,544
The queen and her
aristocratic cronies...

115
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,464
must pay the price
for their gluttony.

116
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,550
We will slaughter them
like the dogs they are.

117
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,635
Starting with this one!

118
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,137
Mr. Peabody!

119
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,306
What should I do?

120
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:33,309
Nothing, Sherman.
Just stay right there.

121
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:34,643
But, Mr. Peabody!

122
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,645
Everything is going
to be fine, Sherman.

123
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,482
Just stay right there.

124
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,698
Off with his head!

125
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,787
Mr. Peabody!

126
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,835
A cantaloupe?

127
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,754
The lowest of the fruits.

128
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,341
Who dares to insult me
with this melon?

129
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:11,889
Get that dog!

130
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:14,850
Mr. Peabody,
how did you escape?

131
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,143
It's simple, Sherman.

132
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,937
I noticed the distance
between the sewer lids...

133
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,355
reasoned that there must be one

134
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:20,731
directly under
the guillotine platform...

135
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,499
noted the loose board
under the basket...

136
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:23,567
computed the angle at
which the setting sun

137
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,933
would bounce off your glasses...

138
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,737
momentarily blinding
the executioner...

139
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,739
and chose that moment
to swipe
the executioner's melon...

140
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,909
giving me the added weight
to tip the boards,
facilitating my exit.

141
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,244
That's amazing!

142
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,411
It's not amazing.

143
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,872
It was just a matter
of keeping my head.

144
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,791
"Keeping your head."

145
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,459
I don't get it.

146
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,878
There he is!
After them!

147
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,713
Come, Sherman, quick!

148
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,427
Oh, this
water tastes terrible.

149
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,388
Interestingly, that's not water.

150
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,601
Ha-ha!

151
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,145
I've got you now.

152
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,816
Indeed you have,
Monsieur Robespierre.

153
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,777
And what a master
of the chase you are.

154
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:07,987
Oh, you noticed?

155
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,113
Of course.

156
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,656
Doubling back on me like that.

157
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,824
That was genius.

158
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:12,992
Thank you.

159
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,077
I just hope you don't take
my little confederate, here.

160
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,745
I depend on him so completely.

161
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:17,997
Get over here, you.

162
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,748
Drats!
You're devilishly clever.

163
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,293
I know.
And much quicker
than you as well.

164
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,044
But are you quick
enough for this?

165
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,421
Ha-ha! See? Quick!

166
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,756
Quick, yes, but not too smart.

167
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,134
Oh! Another cantaloupe!

168
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:31,594
Your sword!

169
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,929
All right, Sherman,
looks like it's time

170
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,806
for a little pop quiz
in the art of fencing.

171
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,099
Go!

172
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,643
Attack! Parry!
Thrust! Repeat!

173
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,437
No.
Remise!

174
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,813
Good boy!

175
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,783
Oh!

176
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,204
Huh?

177
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,788
Ha-ha! You missed!

178
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:00,998
I never miss.

179
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,213
Hop on!

180
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,131
Whoa!

181
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,383
Whoa! Whoa!

182
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:14,345
Yeah! Whoa!

183
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,890
Yeah!

184
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,433
Do you smell that, Sherman?

185
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,976
It wasn't me, Mr. Peabody.

186
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,061
I know it wasn't you.

187
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,812
It's the methane gas
in the sewer system.

188
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,982
And given
the fact that it ignites
at 306 degrees Fahrenheit...

189
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,150
we're about to use it...

190
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,652
to blast out of here!

191
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,987
Hang on!

192
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,161
Whoo!

193
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,667
Wow!

194
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,509
Nice landing, eh, Sherman?
Oof!

195
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,055
So, what did you
learn today, Sherman?

196
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,474
That French Revolution
was crazy.

197
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,642
How so?

198
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,936
All those guys
getting their
heads chopped off...

199
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,689
and nobody standing up
and saying it wasn't right.

200
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,358
And think, Marie Antoinette
could have avoided
the whole revolution...

201
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,026
if she'd simply issued an edict

202
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,695
to distribute
bread amongst the poor.

203
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,542
But then,
she couldn't have
had her dessert.

204
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,031
Why not, Mr. Peabody?

205
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,117
Because, Sherman, you can't have

206
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,577
your cake and edict, too.

207
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,372
I don't get it.

208
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,926
Where are we
gonna go tomorrow,
Mr. Peabody?

209
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:39,096
Ancient Rome?
The Wild West? 1492?

210
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:42,808
No, Sherman,
tomorrow we won't be going
to any of those places.

211
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,018
Oh. Why not?

212
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,342
Because tomorrow's adventure...

213
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:48,230
is one that you're
going to be taking
all on your own.

214
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,773
What do you mean,
Mr. Peabody?

215
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:50,941
Don't you remember?

216
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,359
It's your first day of school.

217
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,611
Oh. Can I drive?
Of course not.

218
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,917
Remember, Sherman,
"i" before "e,"
except after "c."

219
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,753
I know, Mr. Peabody!

220
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,840
And don't forget about
the commutative principle.

221
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,506
Two plus three
equals three plus two.

222
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,342
I know, Mr. Peabody!

223
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,509
And if you have to
go to the bathroom...

224
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,970
just raise your hand proudly
and say, "I have to go."

225
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,805
I will, Mr. Peabody.

226
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,683
And remember,
the No. 2 pencil is
standard for most uses...

227
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,102
but there are times
when a No. 1 comes in handy.

228
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,687
I left a little pencil chart
in your backpack...

229
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,440
which you can consult
if it ever
becomes a judgment call.

230
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:34,651
I think
I'll be okay!

231
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,447
Okay, bye, Mr. Peabody.

232
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,573
Wait.

233
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,824
See you after school.
Sherman!

234
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:43,952
I gotta go. I gotta
sign up for the clubs.

235
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,871
No one is more in
favor of participation

236
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,790
in fraternal
organizations than I.

237
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,168
But before you go,
I want you to have this.

238
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,170
Thanks. What is it?

239
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,005
A dog whistle.

240
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,304
It doesn't work,
Mr. Peabody.

241
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,682
It works fine, Sherman.

242
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,352
It's just a frequency
only dogs can hear.

243
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,062
Oh, cool.

244
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,689
Let that little keepsake
be a reminder to you...

245
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,983
that no matter what
challenges you face,

246
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,236
no matter how far
away I might seem...

247
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,655
Bye, Mr. Peabody!

248
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,077
...I'm with you.

249
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,253
George Washington.

250
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,506
Who can tell me who he is?

251
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,550
Oh, me! I can! I can!

252
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,718
Uh... Sherman.

253
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,680
The first president
of the United
States of America.

254
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,014
Good job.

255
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,059
And when President Washington
was a little boy...

256
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:52,062
what kind of tree
did he cut down?

257
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,355
Ooh! Ooh, me! Me! Me!

258
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,399
Penny?
A cherry tree.

259
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:56,650
Apocryphal.

260
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,860
What kind of tree is that?

261
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,279
It's not a tree.
It's a word.
"Apocryphal."

262
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,114
It means that story is not true.

263
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,866
Really?
Yeah.

264
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,951
George Washington
never cut down
a cherry tree...

265
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,703
and he never said
he couldn't lie.

266
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:10,706
People made those
stories up to teach kids
a lesson about lying...

267
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:11,874
but they're not true.

268
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,196
He did cross the Delaware River,

269
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,878
Christmas night, 1776, though.

270
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,464
My dad took me
there this summer.
We crossed it, too.

271
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,632
I fell in.

272
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,929
Looks like someone
really knows their
history, huh, Penny?

273
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,770
It's really great
meeting you guys.

274
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,814
Maybe you can come over
to my house sometime.

275
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,775
I could bring my new model.
It's a hydrogen atom.

276
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,569
You've only got one, huh?

277
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,529
Guess we'll have to split it.

278
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:44,781
Good one!

279
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,243
Check it, guys.

280
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,498
What do you got there,
Sherman?

281
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,957
Kibbles or bits?

282
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,293
Actually, I've got baby carrots,

283
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,587
organic apple juice,
and a tuna sandwich.

284
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:02,174
It's super-high
in omega-3s.

285
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,927
So, you eat human food, huh?

286
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,595
Yeah. Why wouldn't I?

287
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:07,846
Because you're a dog.

288
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,097
No, I'm not.

289
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,434
Sure you are.
Your dad is a dog,
so you're a dog, too.

290
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,937
I think you're confused.
It's an adoptive
relationship.

291
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,605
Zip it, Carl.
Okay.

292
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,941
Here, I'll show you.
Fetch!

293
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,529
Go on, doggy.
Go get your lunch.

294
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:24,613
Go on.

295
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,697
Go get it.

296
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,451
Ugh. The humiliation.

297
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,287
Sherman,
go get your food.

298
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,331
Make like a good little doggy.

299
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,874
Ruff-ruff!

300
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,674
What's this?
It's mine!

301
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,300
Give it back!

302
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,469
What is it? A whistle?

303
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,764
Ugh! Stupid thing
doesn't even work.

304
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,391
It's a dog whistle, Penny.

305
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,977
It operates at a frequency
that only dogs can hear.

306
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,728
Back up, Carl.
Okay.

307
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,189
Penny, that whistle
is my private property.

308
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,316
Give it back!
Jump, doggy,
jump.

309
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,651
I am not a dog.

310
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:03,819
Come on, Sherman!

311
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,655
Just admit it.
You're a dog. Say it.

312
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:07,864
Let me go!

313
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,492
Not until you beg like a dog.

314
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,411
Come on, Sherman. Beg!

315
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,163
Fight, fight, fight!

316
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,669
Mr. Peabody,
thank you for coming in
on such short notice...

317
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,005
to discuss
the problem with Sherman.

318
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,012
Oh, it's not a problem
at all, Principal Purdy.

319
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,341
I fully expected this.

320
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,509
You did?
Yes.

321
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,970
And, as with all
things Sherman-related,
I prepared for it.

322
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,471
Here's a curriculum
that takes Sherman's

323
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:32,998
advanced preparation
into account...

324
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,808
but won't require you
to have him skip
one or more grades.

325
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:35,892
Mr. Peabody...

326
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,497
Here are some
pre-algebra worksheets,
an advanced reading list...

327
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,272
and a link to
a website I created

328
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,149
so he can start
studying Mandarin Chinese.

329
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,859
It is, after all,
the language of the future.

330
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,027
Mr. Peabody!

331
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,112
I'm not saying he
shouldn't study French,
too, Principal Purdy.

332
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,400
I'm saying have him do both.

333
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:49,531
Mr. Peabody!

334
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,366
What? Not enough? Swahili?

335
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,120
Sherman got into a fight today.

336
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,039
Oh, dear.

337
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,207
Pictures were taken...

338
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,543
for insurance purposes.

339
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,636
He bit her.

340
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:15,891
I must say,
it doesn't look good
for you, Mr. Peabody.

341
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:19,144
After all, you are a dog.

342
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,146
Who, may I ask, are you?

343
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:24,816
I am Ms. Grunion from
the Bureau of Child
Safety and Protection.

344
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,737
We're required by
law to contact them
whenever there's an...

345
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:30,739
incident.

346
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,909
Sherman has never done
anything like this before.

347
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,577
I'm sure he must
have had a reason.

348
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,537
Well, the girl was being
a bit of a bully...

349
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,914
Quiet, Purdy!

350
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:41,333
It's normal for
children to tease.

351
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,002
It's not normal
for them to bite.

352
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,838
Clearly, it's because of
how he's being raised.

353
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,675
In my opinion,
a dog can never be

354
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,511
a suitable parent
to a little boy.

355
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,929
I must point out,
Ms. Grunion...

356
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:55,847
that I won
the right to adopt Sherman

357
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,099
in a court of law.

358
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,018
And the court can
take it away from you.

359
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,606
I'll be coming to your
home tomorrow evening
to conduct an investigation.

360
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:08,402
If I discover that
you are, in any way,
an unfit parent...

361
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,280
I will see to it
Sherman is removed
from your custody.

362
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,079
Permanently.

363
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,916
I hope I've made myself clear.

364
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,713
Crystal.

365
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,426
I'm sorry
I bit her, Mr. Peabody.

366
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,969
I won't do it again.

367
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,595
You're darn tooting
you won't do it again.

368
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,640
This kind of wanton violence
is totally unacceptable.

369
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:42,060
And rather uncharacteristic,
given how you feel
about Mr. Gandhi.

370
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,604
What on earth provoked it?

371
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,944
She called me a dog.

372
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,454
Well, all right then.

373
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,249
Thank you for telling me.

374
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,169
Try and get some sleep.

375
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,800
I love you, Mr. Peabody.

376
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:18,138
I have a deep regard
for you as well, Sherman.

377
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,582
Close your eyes

378
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,504
Have no fear

379
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:56,218
The master's gone
He's on the run

380
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,637
And your daddy's here

381
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:05,143
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

382
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,246
Say a little prayer

383
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,752
Every day, in every way

384
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,672
It's getting better and better

385
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:41,054
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

386
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:49,771
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

387
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,861
A hard road to hoe

388
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:59,906
Yes, it's a long way to go

389
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,076
But in the meantime

390
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,294
Take my hand

391
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:20,302
Life is what happens
to you while you're busy
making other plans

392
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:28,476
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

393
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:36,985
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

394
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:40,572
Mr. Peabody...

395
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,782
you are
a Nobel Prize-winning
scientist.

396
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,492
An advisor to heads of state.

397
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,411
A captain of industry.

398
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,080
Why would you
want to adopt a boy?

399
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,749
Because, Your Honor...

400
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:56,504
when I found Sherman,
it reminded me of how
I started out in life.

401
00:20:56,672 --> 00:21:00,508
And now, I want to give him
the one thing I always wanted.

402
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,927
A home.

403
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,679
And you're sure you're
capable of meeting
all the challenges...

404
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,640
of raising a human boy?

405
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:10,018
With all due respect,
how hard could it be?

406
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,188
Very well, then.

407
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:15,357
If a boy can adopt a dog...

408
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:19,194
I see no reason
why a dog cannot adopt a boy.

409
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:24,866
Da-da!

410
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,493
No, Sherman, not "Da-da."

411
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:28,870
You shall call me
"Mr. Peabody."

412
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,706
Or, in less formal moments,
simply "Peabody."

413
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,376
That's right.

414
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,211
"Mr. Pea-baba."

415
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:41,591
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

416
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:19,874
What's cooking, Mr. Peabody?

417
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,089
Oh, nothing much.

418
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:24,426
Just a little Dungeness
crab with a passion-fruit
basil concassé.

419
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,553
Some truffled quails
in a juniper-berry reduction.

420
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:28,555
And Baked Alaska.

421
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:31,349
Wow! Is today some
kind of special occasion?

422
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:32,434
You could say.

423
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,810
It's not my birthday.

424
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,228
No, it isn't.

425
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:36,479
It's not your birthday.

426
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:37,772
Right again.

427
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,941
It's not Father's Day.
Is it?

428
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,444
Nope. It's not Father's Day.

429
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,904
Is the president
coming to dinner again?

430
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,865
No.
Oh.

431
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:48,575
So, who's coming to dinner?

432
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:51,119
Let's just say,
if the evening
is a success...

433
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,955
we can put this whole
"biting" business behind us.

434
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:03,715
The Petersons! Welcome.

435
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:04,966
So, he's literally a dog.

436
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,217
Paul!

437
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,385
No, that's all right.

438
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,263
Although,
I prefer "literate dog."

439
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,556
That's funny.

440
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,974
Isn't that funny, Paul?

441
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:16,186
He's not
a big laugher.

442
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,969
We're so delighted
you could make it
on such short notice.

443
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:23,151
Aren't we, Sherman?

444
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,654
Yeah, we're interested
in what's going on,
that's for sure.

445
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,656
Say hello to Penny, Sherman.

446
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,283
Hi, Penny.

447
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:31,951
Hello, Sherman.

448
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,661
Now, why don't you go show Penny

449
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,413
your mineral collection,
Sherman?

450
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,123
I'm sure she'll find
those new geodes

451
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,833
of yours fascinating.

452
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:40,919
Come on.

453
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:46,007
I am so glad you
accepted my invitation.

454
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:49,511
Now, the kids can
resolve their differences
before Ms. Grunion arrives.

455
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,930
You're barking up
the wrong tree, mister.
In fact...

456
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:54,498
if it weren't for Patty,
I would have pressed
charges already.

457
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:55,837
And I have to
tell you, Peabody...

458
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,435
where my daughter is concerned,

459
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,020
nothing is more
important than...

460
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,648
Hello. Sure,
I'll take a survey.

461
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:12,283
Everything going swimmingly?

462
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:13,535
Ugh.

463
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,287
Why didn't you tell me
she was coming over here?

464
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,540
Because I didn't
want you to worry.

465
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,947
Okay, because I
didn't want to listen
to your bellyaching.

466
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:23,503
Thank you for your honesty.

467
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:24,671
You're welcome.

468
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,382
I don't know what you
think we're supposed to
do in here anyway.

469
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,967
She hates me.

470
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,177
Share your interests.
Tell a witty anecdote.

471
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:32,387
Mr. Peabody...

472
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:33,972
I hate her.

473
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,015
Sherman,
every great relationship...

474
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,559
starts from a place of conflict,

475
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,060
and evolves into
something richer.

476
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,147
Bonne chance.

477
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:44,649
Make it work.

478
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,901
But don't tell her
about the WABAC.

479
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,741
Don't even
think about it.

480
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,743
Ah.

481
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,841
Peabody,
that was amazing!

482
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:11,926
Paul, wasn't that amazing?

483
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,386
I'm more into
rock-'n'-roll.

484
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:20,768
I meant flamenco.

485
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:28,735
Bagpipes?

486
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:31,029
Uh, didgeridoo.

487
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:35,617
Sitar.

488
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,076
Steel drums.

489
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,286
Trombone.

490
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:39,746
Xylophone.

491
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:40,914
Djembe?

492
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,123
Calliope.

493
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:43,750
Oboe. Piccolo.

494
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:45,376
Tuba. Dobro.

495
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,711
Slide whistle. Yodeling.

496
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:47,921
Hurdy-gurdy. Ocarina.

497
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,297
Harmonium. Musical saw.

498
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,299
You know what?
This has been great...

499
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,551
but a complete waste of time.

500
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,304
Now, let's get Penny
and go home!

501
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:57,555
Are you all right, Paul?

502
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,266
I'm... fine.

503
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:01,893
This happens
whenever he's tense.

504
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,061
Paul, if I might...

505
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,270
Stay away from me, Peabody!

506
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:06,814
Just get back!
I need traction.

507
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:10,068
You can trust me, Paul.
I'm a licensed chiropractor.

508
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:11,569
Ow! Huh.

509
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,746
Ooh...

510
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,249
Ah...

511
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,000
Peabody...

512
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,460
I feel great.

513
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,255
I...
I really feel great!

514
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,757
Peabody,
you're a miracle worker.

515
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,010
Ha-ha! Look at me!

516
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,679
I'm dancing!

517
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:40,932
You know, Penny...

518
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,476
Sigmund Freud says
if you don't like a person...

519
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:47,313
it's because they remind
you of something you
don't like about yourself.

520
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:49,274
What do you know
about Sigmund Freud?

521
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,525
More than you think.

522
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:53,152
Sure.
Just like you know
all that stuff...

523
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,864
about George Washington
not really cutting
down the cherry tree.

524
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,199
Ugh. What a crock.

525
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,367
But it's true!

526
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,160
How do you know?
I just know!

527
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,704
Did you read it in a book?
No!

528
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:03,997
See it in a movie?
No!

529
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,164
Did your brainiac dad tell you?

530
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,291
No!

531
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,618
So, how do you know, Sherman?

532
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:08,960
How do you know?

533
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,211
He told me.

534
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:11,337
Who told you?

535
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:12,964
George Washington.

536
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:16,134
George Washington?

537
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:18,803
Yeah.

538
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,388
Ugh! Liar.

539
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,727
But don't tell
her about the WABAC.

540
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,479
He calls it the "WABAC."

541
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,398
So, where have you gone in it?

542
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,026
Not "where," Penny, "when."

543
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,695
Okay, smart guy, when?

544
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:40,533
Oh, 1965, 1776, 1620...

545
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:44,412
1492, 1215, 4.

546
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,539
Can it go back to an hour ago?
Why?

547
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:49,042
Because I could take it home,
pretend to be sick...

548
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,085
and not come to
this lame dinner party.

549
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,130
Ha-ha. Mr. Peabody says
you should never
use the WABAC...

550
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,424
to travel to
a time when you existed.

551
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:57,633
How come?

552
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:58,758
There would be two of you.

553
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:00,595
Oh, yeah.

554
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:02,513
I guess the world's
not ready for that.

555
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:07,685
Wow.

556
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:11,647
Um, well, now that
we've seen it, maybe
we should go back.

557
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:14,942
Are you kidding?
Where should we go first?

558
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,780
Mr. Peabody says
I'm not allowed to
drive it till I'm older.

559
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,199
Do you do everything
Mr. Peabody says?

560
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:22,450
Yeah.

561
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,410
You know what that
makes you, Sherman.

562
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,412
An obedient son?

563
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,705
Nope.

564
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,082
A dog.

565
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:44,138
Ooh!
Nice control.

566
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,599
Look at him go!
Take it, Patty!

567
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:48,976
Heads up, Paul!
Whoa!

568
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,562
Here you go. Zing!

569
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,568
Oh, yeah.

570
00:28:58,404 --> 00:28:59,987
Oh!
Hey, look at that.

571
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,739
This is fun!

572
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,620
This is a little
homespun concoction
I like to call...

573
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,498
"Einstein on the Beach."

574
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:11,916
Yummy.

575
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,503
To the kids.

576
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,463
To the kids!

577
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,841
Mr. Peabody.

578
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,300
Sherman?

579
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:22,593
Can I talk to you a second?

580
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:23,845
Of course.

581
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,304
Excuse me.

582
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,488
I've really hit it off
with Penny's parents.

583
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,647
I think we can file this night
under "Unqualified Success."

584
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:37,525
Uh, I would hold off
filing it just yet.

585
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,027
What do you mean?
Where's Penny?

586
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,155
Uh... Ancient Egypt.

587
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,532
You used the WABAC?

588
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:48,161
What's happening,
big guy? We're running low.

589
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:52,999
I'll be right there, Paul.

590
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:54,367
How could you do such a thing?

591
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:55,543
She called me a liar...

592
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,752
for saying George Washington

593
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:58,629
never cut down a cherry tree.

594
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,048
So, you took her
to see George Washington?

595
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,217
Yeah. She was into it.

596
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:04,886
Hey, Pea-buddy.

597
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,053
Hey.

598
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,180
Where's Penny?

599
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,681
Playing hide-and-seek.
Pooping.

600
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,683
Pooping.
Playing hide and seek.

601
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,145
Well, which is it?
Uh...

602
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:16,189
Hey, what's going on here?

603
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,024
Yeah. What's going on here?

604
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:19,632
What have you done with Penny?
Penny?

605
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,152
Penny? Penny!

606
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,237
Oh, my gosh!
Where's our daughter?

607
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:25,948
It's hard to say, Paul.

608
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:31,078
She could be here, or here,
or here, or here...

609
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,455
or here.

610
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,666
That will hold them.

611
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,114
I learned that
trick from a swami

612
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,572
at the Begawan Giri
in Ubud, Bali.

613
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,004
Let's go!

614
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:57,021
Ancient Egypt.
Land of the Pharaohs.

615
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,941
A beacon of progress
on the horizon of humanity...

616
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:03,778
but a cruel and
barbarous civilization
just the same.

617
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:06,948
I just hope
Penny isn't suffering
too badly.

618
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,127
I got it.

619
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,587
What are you doing here?

620
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,631
We have come to take you home.

621
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,467
Ugh! What's the Egyptian word
for "tattletale"?

622
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,596
But that's beside the point.
Get your clothes on,
we're going home.

623
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,807
Who died and made you Pharaoh?

624
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:34,892
Now, bring on
the mani-pedi.

625
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,104
See, Mr. Peabody?
Lmpossible!

626
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:39,981
Indeed,
but watch what happens...

627
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:43,401
when an immovable object
meets an irresistible force.

628
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,980
Penny...

629
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:47,113
come here, right now.
Penny, come!

630
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:48,990
I'm not Penny anymore.

631
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:53,661
Now, I'm Princess Hatsheput,
precious flower of the Nile.

632
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:54,912
"Precious," perhaps,
but if you think

633
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,318
"we're going to
leave you here...

634
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,583
you are most
definitely in "de-Nile."

635
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:01,419
I don't get it.

636
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:02,503
Now, come along.

637
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:03,963
Unhand her!

638
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:07,633
What's the matter,
my sweet little
desert blossom?

639
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:10,011
Are these barbarians
bothering you?

640
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,763
As a matter of fact, they are.

641
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,348
Bow, barbarians.

642
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,517
As you wish, Your Highness.

643
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:18,519
Who's that, Mr. Peabody?

644
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:21,105
That, Sherman, is
the living image of Amun...

645
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:24,358
son of Akhenaten,
lord of the 18th Dynasty
of the New Kingdom...

646
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:25,651
King Tutankhamun.

647
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,612
Otherwise known
as "King Tut."

648
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:28,821
My boyfriend.

649
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:31,616
King Tut is
your boyfriend?
Mmm-hmm.

650
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,060
Would you like me
to have them skinned,
covered with honey...

651
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,495
and laid in
a pit of fire ants?

652
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,623
You would do that for me?

653
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,876
Anything, my desert flower.
Consider it a wedding gift.

654
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:44,503
What? You can't
marry this guy!

655
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:45,630
Why not?

656
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:48,507
Well, for one,
his name rhymes
with "butt."

657
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,636
I don't care.
I'm gonna have a big,
fat, Egyptian wedding.

658
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,055
Spoiler alert,
King Tut dies young.

659
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,057
Are you sure you've
thought this through?

660
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,624
Oh, trust me,
I've thought it through.
I'm getting everything.

661
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,478
The royal astronomers
have decreed...

662
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:03,773
the wedding must take
place tomorrow at dawn.

663
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:04,899
Who is he?

664
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,192
He is Ay.
He is you?

665
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,195
I am Ay. The Grand Vizier.

666
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,405
Yeah, that's his name.
Oh.

667
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:14,700
Oh, Grand Vizier,
would you mind telling
the precious princess, here...

668
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,411
precisely what it means
to marry the young Pharaoh.

669
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:18,579
Gladly.

670
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:21,916
It means she
will be bound to him
in eternity...

671
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:23,751
through the sacred ceremonies

672
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,754
of disembowelment
and mummification...

673
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:29,048
as described in the holy texts.

674
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,758
Um, hold up a second.

675
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,593
Can you walk me
through that, somebody?

676
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:35,846
What he means, Penny,
is that when I die
they'll kill you, too.

677
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,683
And then they'll rip out
your organs, stuff them
in canopic jars...

678
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,393
and then mummify
whatever is left.

679
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,602
Okay, I'm seeing this now.

680
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,563
Thank you.
I'm going to go with them.

681
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,608
There's no turning back now.

682
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:48,901
To the palace!

683
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,903
Let the wedding
preparations begin!

684
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:53,531
Mr. Peabody! Sherman!

685
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:54,699
Do something!

686
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,866
Don't worry, Penny!

687
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,201
We'll save you!

688
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,347
Hey, wait! You can't just...

689
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:06,168
Leave us here.

690
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:07,795
Mr. Peabody?

691
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:09,004
Yes, Sherman?

692
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,332
Can
I hold your hand?

693
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,174
Of course you can.

694
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:14,802
Boy, your hand
is cold, Mr. Peabody.

695
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,470
Sherman?
Yeah?

696
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:18,973
That's not my hand.

697
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:26,981
That's disarming.

698
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:30,067
Now, to find a way out of here.

699
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:31,235
Yuck!

700
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,653
Look around, Sherman.

701
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,989
These tombs
are lined with
hieroglyphics...

702
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:37,283
designed to assist
the pharaohs' souls

703
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,535
in their journey
to the afterlife.

704
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:42,830
And they may assist us as well.

705
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,417
Oh, this depicts the god Anubis

706
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,586
sailing the boat of Ra
to the underworld.

707
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:52,214
It appears the boats of Ra
are the key to our escape.

708
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,508
We must find them in time
to stop the wedding.

709
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:57,219
Well, if you ask me,
we should let her
marry that guy.

710
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:58,554
They deserve each other.

711
00:34:58,722 --> 00:34:59,889
What's that, Sherman?

712
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,515
Tut? Give me a break.

713
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:04,894
Bald, wears a skirt, and makeup.

714
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,661
If I didn't know
any better, Sherman,
I would say you were jealous.

715
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:09,565
Jealous? Of what?

716
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,525
Tut's affection
for Penny, of course.

717
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,110
You think I like Penny?

718
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,528
Mmm-hmm.

719
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:15,863
Give me a break!

720
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:20,701
It's not like I
want to hold her hand,
or go to the park...

721
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,704
or watch her while
she's brushing her hair.

722
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,042
Or anything.

723
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:29,543
Hmm.

724
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,296
A-ha!

725
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,467
Quickly, Sherman.

726
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:42,056
Ah, ah, ah!
Careful, Sherman.

727
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:43,891
It's a booby trap.

728
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:46,268
What's so funny?

729
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:47,728
You said "booby."

730
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:52,316
One wrong step
and we're done for.

731
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,152
"The boat...

732
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,822
"of Ra sails straight...

733
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,240
"to day.

734
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:02,952
"Take the wrong boat...

735
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,411
man will pay."

736
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,099
All right, Sherman,
now it's your turn.

737
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,666
Do the puzzle exactly as I did.

738
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,792
Huh?

739
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,502
Think it through,
one step at a time.

740
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,800
The boat of Ra sails straight...

741
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:18,968
play.

742
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,011
Uh, I mean, "pay."

743
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,263
Oh, my.

744
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:26,976
Uh-oh.

745
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:30,806
Run!

746
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,695
The boats of Ra!

747
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:39,823
One boat is the way out,
the other will send us...

748
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,548
plunging into darkness
and certain death.

749
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,033
What?

750
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,201
Sherman, get in the boat.

751
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:47,288
As soon as I move
these blocks together,
it's going to move very fast.

752
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,539
Which boat, Mr. Peabody?

753
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:49,707
What?

754
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,459
Which boat
is the "not-certain-
death-plunge" boat?

755
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,794
That one!

756
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,642
We did it, Sherman!

757
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:09,810
Sherman?

758
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:11,562
Mr. Peabody!

759
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,022
What are you doing over there?

760
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,399
I thought you
pointed to this one!

761
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,660
Ahhh!

762
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,885
Sherman? Sherman?

763
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:44,511
Are you all right?

764
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,847
I'm good.

765
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,528
The sun god, Ra...

766
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:06,283
commands us to begin
the sacred ceremony!

767
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:20,047
Bring forth the blade
for the blood oath.

768
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:28,973
Where blade meets flesh
in this sacred rite...

769
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:32,893
We pay tribute...

770
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:35,229
to the sun god, Ra!

771
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:37,231
Wait!

772
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:39,984
Anubis!

773
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,235
The god of death!

774
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:43,570
The wedding
must not continue.

775
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,614
Why, Anubis, why?

776
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:48,283
Plagues. Plagues!

777
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:50,786
If this marriage
pact is sealed...

778
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:54,790
I will shower
down upon the land
uncountable plagues.

779
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,458
Oy, again with the plagues!

780
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,627
Why did I ever move to Egypt?

781
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:01,922
But, Anubis,
the sun god, Ra,
has decreed...

782
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,758
that this girl
is to be
the boy-king's wife.

783
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:06,593
That's so funny.

784
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,972
I was talking to
the sun god, Ra,
just the other day...

785
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,766
and he told me
he changed his mind.

786
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:13,851
Really?

787
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:17,855
Old "Flip-Flop Ra,"
we call him here
in the underworld.

788
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:21,191
But it's too late.
We've already paid
for the catering.

789
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:26,155
Too bad!
You're going to
lose your deposit.

790
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:32,119
More smoke, Sherman.
This canine
subterfuge is working.

791
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:33,454
Deliver the girl...

792
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,498
to the gates of the city,
and leave her there...

793
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:39,793
where the gods
will retrieve her forthwith.

794
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:43,964
Only in this
manner may the plagues
upon this land be avoided.

795
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,133
The girl must go!

796
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:48,635
Ow!

797
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,471
Anubis has spoken!

798
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,848
Take this girl to the gates!

799
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,141
Ow.

800
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:02,024
Anubis, you sound unwell.

801
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:04,693
Well, I have been feeling
a little under the weather...

802
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,488
but I'm feeling much better now.

803
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:09,406
Thank you.

804
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,077
Phew! Huh?

805
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,461
Penny, Sherman, quickly.

806
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:23,629
Come on, Penny.

807
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:24,880
Sherman!

808
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,133
Ah!

809
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,054
Runaway bride!

810
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:33,764
Stop them, you fools!

811
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:37,810
Ah!

812
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,869
Penny, Sherman, climb aboard.

813
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,497
Whoo-hoo!

814
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,215
They're getting away!

815
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:09,883
Ah!

816
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,686
Whoa!

817
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,607
I got it.

818
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:29,486
Whoo-hoo! We made it.

819
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,452
Where do we
go next, Mr. Peabody?
Home.

820
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,334
We've got to get back
to the dinner party...

821
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:35,284
before Penny's parents
realize she's missing.

822
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,786
We don't have to
mention the whole...

823
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:39,830
uh, King Tut
wedding thing, right?

824
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,165
Certainly not.

825
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:42,958
Anyway, as far as I'm concerned,

826
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,804
they get married too
young in Ancient Egypt.

827
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:47,838
Or, perhaps,
I'm just some old "Giza."

828
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:50,924
Huh?

829
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,135
Warning.

830
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,762
WABAC power supply insufficient.

831
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,348
Charge now. Warning.

832
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,100
Uh, what's the matter,
Mr. Peabody?

833
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,978
All this zipping about
the cosmos has drained
our power supply.

834
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:05,272
We're going to have to
make an unscheduled stop.

835
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:06,690
As luck would have it...

836
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,934
we have just enough
power to make it
to the Renaissance.

837
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:25,459
I can't even
tell my left brain
from my right anymore!

838
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:27,628
How many times
I got to tell you,
Mona Lisa?

839
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:28,795
Mona Lisa?

840
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:30,964
I can't
paint the picture...

841
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:33,050
until you smile!

842
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:36,803
Leonardo, tell me one thing
I have to smile about.

843
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,722
The sunshine, the pasta.

844
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:42,726
All the things that make
Italy such a popular
tourist destination!

845
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:45,687
But I have not
seen any of them,
Leonardo!

846
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:49,149
Because I'm
sitting here all day
on my abbondanza!

847
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,736
I don't think
that means
"chair" in Italian.

848
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,989
Ah, Peabody, my old friend.

849
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:58,575
What a welcome interruption!

850
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:02,329
Believe you me,
this woman is
making me nuts.

851
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:04,081
So, how you been?

852
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,041
Good to see you.
What do you want?

853
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:08,001
We're in a desperate
hurry to get home,

854
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,878
but the WABAC
needs a jump start...

855
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:12,339
and we thought, who better than

856
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:14,675
Leonardo da Vinci to
help us on our way?

857
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,261
Peabody,
I would love to help you,

858
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:19,763
but you come at a very bad time.

859
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:23,016
I don't know
what I'm going to do
with this crazy woman.

860
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,602
You see what I mean?

861
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:26,888
What seems to be the problem?

862
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,272
"What is the problem?"

863
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,024
I am halfway done
with the painting,
she won't even smile.

864
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:34,069
Fine. I smile.

865
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:38,865
No! That's a fake smile!

866
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,367
Everybody knows that!

867
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,786
Why don't you
make it a real smile?

868
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,413
Why don't you say
something funny?

869
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,039
I paint the paintings.

870
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:48,041
I make the machines.

871
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:50,961
I don't tell the jokes!

872
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,714
Perhaps, I can be
of assistance. You see...

873
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,924
humor is not immune
to the laws of science.

874
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:57,884
Using algorithms,
we can extrapolate

875
00:43:58,011 --> 00:43:59,761
what is universally
considered "funny"...

876
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:02,055
thus producing a formula that is

877
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:04,224
scientifically
certain to cause laughter.

878
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,227
Case in point, the pratfall.

879
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,277
Is everyone amused?

880
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:18,488
Hmm.

881
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,157
The data
was so clear. Ooh!

882
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:21,616
Don't worry, Mr. Peabody.

883
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,118
I got it!
Sherman... Ahh!

884
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,370
Oh!

885
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,093
Hold that smile!

886
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,262
Hold it right there!
No move! No move!

887
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:53,023
Well, Leo, if my
calculations are correct...

888
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,817
this machine of
ours should generate
enough centrifugal force...

889
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:57,194
to send us home.

890
00:44:57,362 --> 00:44:59,780
I got one last piece
I gotta pound in place.

891
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:03,116
Sherman, why don't
you fetch the hammer
for Mr. Da Vinci?

892
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:05,118
Okay, Mr. Peabody.

893
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:10,916
Mr. Peabody!

894
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,125
Well done, Sherman.

895
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:13,293
But, Mr. Peabody!

896
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:14,795
Very helpful.

897
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:30,477
Sherman!

898
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,479
Yes, Mr. Peabody?

899
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:34,398
The hammer.

900
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,066
Da Vinci.

901
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:38,610
Oh. Okay, Mr. Peabody.

902
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,655
Oh!

903
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:43,907
Here you go, Mr. Da Vinci.
Ahh!

904
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,158
Do you need any help?

905
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:47,160
No, no.
That's quite all right.

906
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:48,829
Thank you.

907
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,580
Psst! Sherman.

908
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,333
Huh?
Let's go. Let's go explore.

909
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,044
Uh, well, I'm supposed
to be having

910
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,213
father-son time
with Mr. Peabody.

911
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:00,048
Wouldn't you rather
have fun with me?

912
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:01,383
Uh...

913
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,634
Okay.

914
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:03,760
Sherman...

915
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,011
where are you going?

916
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,263
Exploring.

917
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:07,556
But we need your help.

918
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,225
No, we don't!
I mean, we can manage.

919
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:11,518
Somehow.

920
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:13,395
He's a boy, Peabody.

921
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:16,189
Let him have his fun.
Let him go.

922
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:18,024
Thanks, Mr. Peabody!

923
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,738
He's growing up, Peabody.

924
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,950
Like a baby bird
leaving the nest.

925
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:29,536
Isn't it wonderful?

926
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:38,712
It's like a museum.

927
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,048
It's like a toy store.

928
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:48,555
Wow.

929
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:53,560
Check this out.

930
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:56,229
It's the world's
biggest model airplane.

931
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:59,065
It's not a model, Penny.
It's a prototype.

932
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:02,235
And we should probably
just leave that alone.

933
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,361
Okay.

934
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:05,489
But wouldn't it be cool
if we could fly it?

935
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,657
I don't think
Mr. Peabody would like that.

936
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,910
Well, Mr. Peabody
isn't here.

937
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,620
Just tell me how it works.

938
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:12,996
Please?

939
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,456
For learning.

940
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:16,291
Oh. Okay.

941
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:20,253
The thrust comes from
this kind of crossbow
doohickey here.

942
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:24,424
Then it shoots along
the track until the wind
catches the wings.

943
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,343
But how does it go?
Huh?

944
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:27,928
How do you take off?

945
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,180
Oh, you just
pull down that lever.

946
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:32,682
This one?

947
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:33,975
Oh, boy.

948
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,602
Ah!

949
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:41,066
Wow! Whoo-hoo!

950
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:44,277
This is crazy!

951
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:46,696
No, it's not Sherman.
It's fun!

952
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,156
We're gonna die!

953
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:51,117
Oh, stop being
such a party pooper and
enjoy it!

954
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:57,707
Ah...

955
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,627
Nothing is as beautiful
as an elegant equation...

956
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:03,463
translated into
perfect engineering.

957
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:05,632
Why can't children be so simple?

958
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,802
Because children
are not machines, Peabody.

959
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:12,180
Believe me,
I tried to build one.

960
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:14,474
Oh! It was creepy.

961
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,520
Here, Sherman!
You fly it!

962
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:19,980
But I don't want to fly!

963
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,982
Sure you do. It'll be fun!

964
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,734
No, seriously, Penny,
I don't want to!

965
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,653
I'm letting go. One...

966
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:27,862
Don't let go!

967
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:28,989
Two...

968
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:30,574
No!
Three!

969
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:34,995
Penny, fly the plane!

970
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:36,621
No, Sherman!

971
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:37,987
You're going to have to save us!

972
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:39,040
But I can't do it!

973
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:42,419
I'm serious, Penny.
I don't know how to fly!

974
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:44,337
You can do it!
I know you can!

975
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:45,625
Come on, Sherman.

976
00:48:45,715 --> 00:48:46,715
Fly!

977
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:54,931
Ah!

978
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:01,438
Phew!

979
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,868
See? You got this,
Sherman.

980
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:17,746
You're right.
I have got this.

981
00:49:18,331 --> 00:49:20,206
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

982
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,797
Da Vinci's at it again!

983
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,549
You ever see that child he made?

984
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:31,051
So creepy.

985
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,761
Papa. Mama.

986
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,430
Papa. Mama.

987
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,833
All done up here, Leonardo.

988
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,169
And I am all done down here.

989
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:08,088
It is beautiful, isn't it?

990
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:12,425
Every piece in its place
doing precisely what
it's supposed to do.

991
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:14,010
Look, Peabody!

992
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:16,096
It's my flying mach...

993
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,597
My flying machine?

994
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:18,848
Sherman.

995
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:19,933
Sherman?

996
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:22,352
Sherman, what are
you doing up there?

997
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,937
I'm flying!

998
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:26,731
But, Sherman,
you don't know how to fly!

999
00:50:26,816 --> 00:50:27,857
I don't?

1000
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:28,942
No!

1001
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,533
Turn!

1002
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:37,617
Turn, Sherman!

1003
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:39,828
Lean!

1004
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,125
Oh, no!

1005
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,883
Sherman?

1006
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:56,177
Sherman! Are you okay?

1007
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:59,013
That was pretty fantastic!

1008
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:02,350
Oh! I can't believe it!

1009
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,562
My flying machine!
It's work!

1010
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:10,108
Sherman!
You are the first flying man!

1011
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,193
Oh, you should be
very proud, Peabody.

1012
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:14,028
Very, very proud!

1013
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,322
"Proud" doesn't
begin to describe it.

1014
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:20,660
Leonardo, will you please
fire up the mechanism?

1015
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:42,932
Papa. Mama.

1016
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,893
Mona!

1017
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,520
Papa. Mama.

1018
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:48,605
The kid!

1019
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,717
I'm sorry I broke
the plane, Mr. Peabody.

1020
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,428
Well, you should be.
You could have been killed.

1021
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:21,930
What are you talking about?

1022
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,766
Sherman flew a plane.
He was amazing!

1023
00:52:24,934 --> 00:52:28,353
Sherman destroyed
a priceless
historical artifact.

1024
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:30,688
Whatever. You
should be happy.

1025
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:33,416
It turns out Sherman
is not a complete and
total loser, after all.

1026
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:34,776
Yeah, Mr. Peabody.

1027
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,529
It turns out I'm not
a complete and
total loser, after all.

1028
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,323
Ms. Peterson...

1029
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,951
stop turning my son
into a hooligan.

1030
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:44,397
It's not my fault
he's a hooligan.

1031
00:52:44,537 --> 00:52:47,038
Yeah, it's not her
fault I'm a hooligan.

1032
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:48,581
Well, it's certainly
not my fault!

1033
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:50,166
I've spent the last seven years

1034
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:51,709
teaching Sherman good judgment.

1035
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:52,919
If you're such a great parent...

1036
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,588
why is Ms. Grunion
trying to take
Sherman away from you?

1037
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:00,134
Is that true?

1038
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,387
Is someone gonna
take me away from you?

1039
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:04,889
No, Sherman,
I'll never let that happen.

1040
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:06,641
You just need to trust me.

1041
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:09,143
Oh, dear, a black hole!

1042
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,234
What's happening?

1043
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:17,682
If I can't pull
us out of here...

1044
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,780
we're going to be
smashed to smithereens
on the event horizon.

1045
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:28,580
There's not enough
power to resist
the gravitational pull!

1046
00:53:28,998 --> 00:53:31,583
I've got to divert everything
to the reverse thrusters.

1047
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,750
Why didn't you tell me?

1048
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:33,918
Tell you what?

1049
00:53:34,003 --> 00:53:35,461
Why didn't you
tell me Ms. Grunion

1050
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,046
was trying to take
me away from you?

1051
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:39,181
It's not your job to
worry about these things.

1052
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,860
You just didn't
think I could handle it.

1053
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:43,094
We'll discuss it later.
Now, sit down.

1054
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:45,138
I don't want to
discuss it later!

1055
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:46,639
Sherman, sit!

1056
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:48,725
You can't talk to me like that.

1057
00:53:48,893 --> 00:53:50,143
I'm not a dog.

1058
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:51,519
What did you say?

1059
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:54,105
I said, I'm not a dog!

1060
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,774
You're right,
Sherman, you're not.

1061
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:59,235
You're just a very bad boy!

1062
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,613
T-minus 10...

1063
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,740
Nine, eight...

1064
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:04,908
Seven...

1065
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:05,992
Six...

1066
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:07,243
Five...

1067
00:54:07,328 --> 00:54:09,120
Four, three...

1068
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:10,663
Two...

1069
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:11,831
One.

1070
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:27,472
Sherman?

1071
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:28,973
Penny?

1072
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:31,100
Sherman, are you okay?

1073
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:35,897
Sherman?

1074
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:44,989
He's gone.

1075
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:47,033
Where are we, anyway?

1076
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:49,702
Oh, no.

1077
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:53,164
We're on the brink
of one of history's
most ferocious conflicts...

1078
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:10,264
Delivery.

1079
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:20,358
How are we doing,
heroes of Greece?

1080
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:21,776
Feeling good?

1081
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:23,778
Feeling strong?

1082
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:26,531
Okay, let's get warmed up!

1083
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:28,366
We don't want to pull
something out there.

1084
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:30,368
Remember what
happened to Achilles.

1085
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:32,495
That whole thing with his heel.

1086
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:36,499
Looking good, Diomedes.

1087
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:38,584
Menelaus, my man!

1088
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:40,003
My man.

1089
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,422
Are you ready
to get on the field,
Shermanus?

1090
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:44,841
Sure thing, Mr. Agamemnon.

1091
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,176
That's cute.

1092
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:50,430
Shh.

1093
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:55,351
Odysseus,
what news do you bring?

1094
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,645
Someone left this for us.

1095
00:55:57,813 --> 00:55:59,063
A present. Nice.

1096
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,482
It looks just like our horse.

1097
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:04,360
Should I bring it inside?

1098
00:56:05,738 --> 00:56:07,071
It would be rude not to.

1099
00:56:12,453 --> 00:56:14,287
I did not see that coming!

1100
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:18,124
Ugh! Jeez Louise,
what is that smell?

1101
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,209
Oh!

1102
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,378
Ooh. That is
the smell of victory.

1103
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:24,756
Yeah! Victory!

1104
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:27,675
Greetings, men of
Athens, Sparta and Thebes.

1105
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:29,093
Peabody, here.

1106
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:30,845
I've come for Sherman.

1107
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:32,847
Do you know this guy?
I thought I did...

1108
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:34,474
but now I'm not so sure.

1109
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,768
Then he must be a spy.
Kill him!

1110
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,853
No! No!

1111
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,814
He's my dad.

1112
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:43,232
Your dad?
Huh?

1113
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,443
It's an adoptive relationship.

1114
00:56:46,195 --> 00:56:47,612
Aw!

1115
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,698
Thank you for
taking such good care
of my son, Agamemnon...

1116
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:53,242
but it's time for
him to come home.

1117
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:56,079
Sorry, Mr. Peabody,
I've joined the Greek army.

1118
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,538
Shermanus is one of us now.

1119
00:56:57,706 --> 00:56:58,946
He's a brother.
I'm his brother.

1120
00:56:58,999 --> 00:56:59,999
He's my son.

1121
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:01,334
He took an oath.
I took an oath.

1122
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:02,502
He's seven!

1123
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:04,295
And a half!

1124
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:08,007
All sons must
prove themselves
to their fathers.

1125
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:08,841
Today...

1126
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:13,429
Shermanus will prove himself
on the field of battle.

1127
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:14,597
But he's only a child.

1128
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:17,642
Your dad may not think
you're ready to
become a man, Shermanus...

1129
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:18,851
but we do.

1130
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:20,019
Yeah!

1131
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:21,062
Yeah, Mr. Peabody.

1132
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:22,980
Now, I'll show you
what I can handle.

1133
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,483
FYI, a lot of heroes
have father issues.

1134
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:27,068
My old man is a minotaur.

1135
00:57:27,236 --> 00:57:30,363
Half man,
half bull, all judgment.

1136
00:57:30,531 --> 00:57:32,657
Ajax, here, strongest
guy in the world...

1137
00:57:32,825 --> 00:57:36,369
but his father never
accepted that his real
dream was to sing.

1138
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:38,287
I wanted to be
in the Greek chorus.

1139
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,535
Uh, yeah, and
don't even get me
started about Oedipus.

1140
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:42,500
Let's just say
that you do not want

1141
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:44,460
to be at his house
over the holidays.

1142
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:45,837
It's awkward.

1143
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,131
Sherman, I'm concerned
you haven't
thought this through.

1144
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:51,551
This is war.
Do you realize
what's about to happen?

1145
00:57:51,844 --> 00:57:53,302
I'll tell you
what's gonna happen.

1146
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,680
We're gonna
destroy their houses!

1147
00:57:55,848 --> 00:57:57,181
Pull down their temples!

1148
00:57:57,349 --> 00:58:00,393
And make the streets
of the city run red...

1149
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,562
with Trojan blood!

1150
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:03,813
Yeah!

1151
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:08,442
Blood!
Blood! Blood!

1152
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:19,287
Zeus on three! One!

1153
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:22,123
Sherman, I absolutely
forbid you to fight
in the Trojan War.

1154
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:25,084
It's not fair! All my
friends are fighting
in the Trojan War.

1155
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:26,836
Two!
Sherman, it's dangerous.

1156
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:28,045
I'm wearing a helmet.

1157
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,547
Three!
You're not going!

1158
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:30,798
Oh, yes, I am.

1159
00:58:30,883 --> 00:58:32,592
Zeus!

1160
00:58:33,302 --> 00:58:35,344
Zeus! Zeus!

1161
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:41,100
Eat my bronze, you Trojan dogs!

1162
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:45,271
Eat my bronze, you Trojan dog!

1163
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,774
Ahh!

1164
00:58:58,577 --> 00:59:00,161
Well, that's cutting it close.

1165
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,749
This is why I ask you
to obey me, Sherman.

1166
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:10,004
Because I'm your father,
and it's my job
to keep you safe.

1167
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:14,258
But are you sure
Ms. Grunion won't
take me away?

1168
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:17,887
Not as long as I'm around.

1169
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:31,234
Mr. Peabody!

1170
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,902
Help me!

1171
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:34,737
Penny!

1172
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,080
Smell my victory!

1173
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:45,706
Smell it!

1174
00:59:45,874 --> 00:59:48,251
Hey! That's my ride!

1175
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:56,175
Mr. Peabody...

1176
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:57,426
hurry!

1177
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:01,347
I'll take that.

1178
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,022
You did it, Sherman!

1179
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:52,273
Mr. Peabody helped.

1180
01:00:52,441 --> 01:00:53,983
Now, let's get to
the WABAC, go home,

1181
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:55,693
un-hypnotize
Penny's parents...

1182
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:57,069
finish that dinner party,
eat my Baked Alaska...

1183
01:00:57,237 --> 01:00:58,557
charm the pants
off Ms. Grunion...

1184
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:00,948
and make sure none
of this ever happens
in the first place.

1185
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:02,908
Sounds good.

1186
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,076
I'm in.

1187
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:05,578
Ah!

1188
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,081
Sherman!

1189
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:11,250
Penny!
Sherman, no!

1190
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,095
Whoa!

1191
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,562
Mr. Peabody...

1192
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:34,273
Mr. Peabody?

1193
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:40,654
Mr. Peabody!

1194
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:43,657
Dad!

1195
01:01:54,086 --> 01:01:58,047
Oh, Mr. Peabody!
What should I do?
What should I do?

1196
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:03,761
There's nothing
you can do, Sherman.

1197
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,849
I just want to go home.

1198
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,186
Home.

1199
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:14,814
That's it.

1200
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:17,066
I got an idea.

1201
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:18,901
Come on!

1202
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:21,779
Where are we gonna go?

1203
01:02:21,947 --> 01:02:23,114
We're going home.

1204
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:25,199
There's only one person
who can help us...

1205
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:26,909
and that's Mr. Peabody.

1206
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:29,662
What are you talking about?
How is that even possible?

1207
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:31,110
We've got a time machine, Penny!

1208
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:33,040
I can set it so
that we'll get home

1209
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:35,000
when Mr. Peabody
is still there.

1210
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:36,657
But I thought
you're not supposed

1211
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:37,962
to go back to a time
when you existed.

1212
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:39,630
What choice do we have?

1213
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:44,760
Error.
You are attempting to travel
to an era in which you exist.

1214
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:46,568
This could alter
the fabric of space-time.

1215
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:51,058
Error. Error.

1216
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:52,935
Hang on!

1217
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,278
This is fun!

1218
01:03:05,157 --> 01:03:08,451
This is a little
homespun concoction
I like to call...

1219
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,036
"Einstein on the Beach."

1220
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,538
Yummy.

1221
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:15,958
To the kids.

1222
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:17,918
To the kids!

1223
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:20,337
Mr. Peabody.

1224
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:21,922
Sherman? Penny?

1225
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:23,424
Can we talk to you a second?

1226
01:03:23,592 --> 01:03:24,383
Of course.

1227
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:25,843
Excuse me.

1228
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:30,431
I've really hit it off
with your parents.

1229
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:33,767
I think we can file
this night under
"Unqualified Success."

1230
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:36,353
I'd hold off
filing it just yet.

1231
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:37,313
What do you mean?

1232
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:39,815
Why are you two dressed
like ancient Greeks?

1233
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:41,484
You used the WABAC!
I did.

1234
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,277
I know, it's terrible!

1235
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:44,445
But why?

1236
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:46,688
Penny and I got
into an argument
about George Washington.

1237
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:47,978
So, I made him
show me the WABAC.

1238
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:49,396
And I lost her in ancient Egypt.

1239
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:50,618
And I got engaged to King Tut.

1240
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:52,453
So, I came back
and got you.
Then we ran out of gas.

1241
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:54,246
In Florence.
Went into a black hole.

1242
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:55,998
And then you died
in ancient Troy.

1243
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:58,417
Died? I have a hard
time believing that.

1244
01:03:58,585 --> 01:03:59,585
It's true!

1245
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:02,046
But now you're here,
and everything's
gonna be okay.

1246
01:04:02,214 --> 01:04:04,215
I told you never to come back
to a time when you existed...

1247
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:05,758
because there
would be two of you!

1248
01:04:05,926 --> 01:04:08,385
Yeah, but the other one
of me is in ancient Egypt.

1249
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:13,265
Ahh!

1250
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:14,391
Who are you?

1251
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,227
He's you, but
from another timeline.

1252
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:19,480
But I thought you said
never to come back to
a time when you existed.

1253
01:04:19,648 --> 01:04:21,315
Exactly!
I know.

1254
01:04:22,067 --> 01:04:25,569
But what was I supposed
to do? Mr. Peabody
died in ancient Troy.

1255
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:26,487
Died?

1256
01:04:26,655 --> 01:04:28,197
I have a hard time
believing that.

1257
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:29,365
Thank you.

1258
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:30,783
What are we going to do?

1259
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:33,244
Well, for starters,
both Shermans
can't stay here.

1260
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:34,745
Why? We could
get bunk beds.

1261
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:36,113
I was thinking the same thing.

1262
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:37,748
That's so weird.
It's like we're twins!

1263
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:38,832
I was thinking that, too!

1264
01:04:39,251 --> 01:04:40,334
Ow!

1265
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:43,295
You see? We can't
have two Shermans in
the same timeline.

1266
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:46,882
It puts too much strain
on the space-time continuum.

1267
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:48,884
What to do?
The Petersons

1268
01:04:48,969 --> 01:04:50,344
can't know any of this.

1269
01:04:50,512 --> 01:04:51,929
Hey, Pea-buddy.

1270
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:53,639
Hey.

1271
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:54,765
How's it going?

1272
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:57,518
Patty and I are
working up an appetite.

1273
01:04:58,061 --> 01:05:00,104
Mmm. The smells
coming from your
kitchen are yummy!

1274
01:05:00,272 --> 01:05:02,398
Especially that Baked Alaska.

1275
01:05:02,983 --> 01:05:04,358
So, what's going on here?

1276
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:05,859
Yeah, what's with the getups?

1277
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,736
Toga party!

1278
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,446
Toga party?

1279
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:13,117
Yes, it is a toga party!

1280
01:05:13,285 --> 01:05:14,535
Well, what about dinner?

1281
01:05:14,703 --> 01:05:15,703
I'm starving.

1282
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:16,996
Why don't we head
into the dining room...

1283
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:19,243
and tuck into those quails
you've been yakking about?

1284
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:20,249
No!
Why not?

1285
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:24,128
Because it's so fun right here!

1286
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:27,089
Whoo-hoo!

1287
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:35,222
Ms. Grunion!

1288
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:37,016
How delightful.

1289
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,767
We were having
such a good time...

1290
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:40,295
I almost forgot
you were coming.
Oh!

1291
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:41,979
Well, why don't
you join the party?

1292
01:05:42,147 --> 01:05:45,733
I'm not here for a party.
I'm here for
the investigation.

1293
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:49,153
Good. Why don't
you start investigating
over here?

1294
01:05:49,321 --> 01:05:52,281
Or here, or here, or here...

1295
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:54,033
Stop waving your hands around!

1296
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:57,786
Sherman?

1297
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,622
Wait! Is that...?

1298
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,415
Sherman!

1299
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:04,752
Dos Shermanos? What's
going on here, Peabody?

1300
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:07,254
Oh...

1301
01:06:07,339 --> 01:06:08,505
Um...

1302
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:09,757
Nobody move!

1303
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:13,260
Sherman, I've got to
get you out of here
before you touch yourself.

1304
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:17,306
Mr. Peabody!
You didn't die!

1305
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:18,932
Of course I didn't die.

1306
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,184
Thank you.

1307
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,269
Hey. How did you get back?

1308
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:24,063
Well, after a few
failed experiments...

1309
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:26,440
I hit upon a combination
of bones, stone
and yak fat...

1310
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:28,609
and constructed
a rudimentary WABAC.

1311
01:06:28,777 --> 01:06:29,777
You know what they say...

1312
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:33,113
"If at first
you don't succeed,
Troy, Troy again."

1313
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:35,949
This is no time for puns!
Even good ones.

1314
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,576
Penny, Sherman, quickly!

1315
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,620
You're not going anywhere.

1316
01:06:39,788 --> 01:06:42,039
I've seen quite enough
to remove the boy...

1317
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:44,625
both boys,
from this home.

1318
01:06:44,793 --> 01:06:47,670
No, don't,
Ms. Grunion, please!

1319
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:50,964
This is all my fault.
I started it.

1320
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:53,676
I'm so sorry, Sherman.

1321
01:06:54,803 --> 01:06:57,554
You have nothing
to apologize for, Penny.

1322
01:06:57,722 --> 01:06:59,390
A dog should never
have been allowed

1323
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:01,183
to adopt a boy
in the first place.

1324
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:02,476
Now, come along.

1325
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:04,103
Ms. Grunion,
be careful!

1326
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:06,397
Ah! Oh!

1327
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:07,481
What's happening?

1328
01:07:12,404 --> 01:07:14,488
Mr. Peabody, help!

1329
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:15,823
Sherman!
Sherman!

1330
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:21,453
Oh!

1331
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:31,463
Hey! Where did
the other two go?

1332
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:36,218
Our cosmic doubles
combined in order to
reconcile a paradox...

1333
01:07:36,428 --> 01:07:39,012
in the space-time continuum.

1334
01:07:39,431 --> 01:07:40,931
Okay, that makes sense.

1335
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:43,350
I don't know what
just happened here...

1336
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:46,228
but I know it was wrong!

1337
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:48,105
This boy is coming with me!
Mr. Peabody!

1338
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:49,732
No, Ms. Grunion!
Ow! Let me go!

1339
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:50,941
Get back here!

1340
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,360
Ow! Ow! You're hurting me!

1341
01:07:56,364 --> 01:07:57,781
Oh! Oh!

1342
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:03,495
He bit me!

1343
01:08:04,873 --> 01:08:06,749
He bit me!

1344
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:09,877
Yes, hello, police.

1345
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:11,962
I'd like to report an assault.

1346
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:13,130
A bite.

1347
01:08:13,298 --> 01:08:15,382
Mr. Peabody,
what are we gonna do?

1348
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:17,030
Get here
as soon as possible.

1349
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:18,135
Run!

1350
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,721
He's kidnapping
the children! Oh!

1351
01:08:23,892 --> 01:08:25,517
I can't believe
you bit her, Mr. Peabody!

1352
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:27,436
I know, Sherman, it was wrong.

1353
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:28,312
"Wrong"?

1354
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,147
It was awesome!

1355
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:33,734
And now, to return
to our proper timeline
and erase this mess.

1356
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:41,158
There he is!
He's got my daughter
in that giant space apple!

1357
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:50,209
My face is numb.

1358
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:53,837
Whoo-hoo!
Yes!

1359
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:56,298
What's wrong?

1360
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:02,221
Time travel failed.

1361
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:03,680
Oh, dear.

1362
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:06,016
What is it,
Mr. Peabody?

1363
01:09:06,184 --> 01:09:07,142
Our cosmic doubles colliding...

1364
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:08,950
ripped a hole
in the space-time continuum.

1365
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:11,396
That's why we didn't
get to the past.

1366
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:16,610
Hey, Peabody!

1367
01:09:16,778 --> 01:09:18,737
Looks like the past
is coming to us.

1368
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:22,825
Oof! I will get you, dog!

1369
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:24,910
And your little boy, too!

1370
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:28,580
Penny!

1371
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:29,748
My bride!

1372
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:34,586
What?

1373
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:39,550
Oh, dear.

1374
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:49,560
Follow that orb!

1375
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:04,283
Incoming!

1376
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:09,788
What sort of creature are you?

1377
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:12,791
The name is Grunion!

1378
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:16,712
I'm in love!

1379
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:21,675
I just need to find a wormhole.

1380
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:30,809
Hey, Einstein, it's a red light.

1381
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:32,853
Hey, I'm walking, here!

1382
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:35,480
Cake!

1383
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:37,107
Mmm!

1384
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:42,571
There they go.
Don't lose them.

1385
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:50,203
I'm trying to find
another wormhole...

1386
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:51,246
but they all lead
back to the present!

1387
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:52,664
Time travel failed.

1388
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:54,833
Time travel failed.

1389
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:01,715
Whoo!

1390
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:03,967
There he is. After them!

1391
01:11:04,135 --> 01:11:06,803
Penny, my queen,
I know you're in there.

1392
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:09,848
We're coming, Shermanus!

1393
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:14,935
Time travel failed.

1394
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:16,021
Mr. Peabody!

1395
01:11:16,064 --> 01:11:17,189
Look out!

1396
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,692
Whoa!

1397
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:27,908
Shermanus, hold on.

1398
01:11:28,076 --> 01:11:30,035
We shall release
you from this egg.

1399
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:35,916
Drop the saber
and step away from
the futuristic orb.

1400
01:11:36,084 --> 01:11:38,251
I take orders from no man!

1401
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:48,053
Don't tase me, bro.

1402
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:50,597
Come out, Peabody,
with your paws in the air.

1403
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,977
Mr. Peabody,
you're under arrest...

1404
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:57,270
for kidnapping,
reckless endangerment...

1405
01:11:57,438 --> 01:12:00,732
And a multiplicity
of major traffic violations.

1406
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:01,900
You don't understand.

1407
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:04,236
There's a rip
in the space-time continuum!

1408
01:12:04,404 --> 01:12:06,363
If you arrest me,
I won't be able to fix...

1409
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:08,532
Blah, blah, blah.
For too long...

1410
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:11,576
you've bamboozled the world
with your fancy jargon...

1411
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:12,911
and that little
red tie of yours...

1412
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,413
and look what's come of it.

1413
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:15,580
Take him away!

1414
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:16,665
Wait.

1415
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:18,834
Mr. Peabody!

1416
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:19,876
Sherman!

1417
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:23,797
What's gonna happen
to Mr. Peabody?

1418
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:26,925
Don't you know
what happens to
dogs that bite?

1419
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:28,593
Let me go.

1420
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:30,041
You don't know
what you're doing.

1421
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:32,180
Please, before it's too late.

1422
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:33,765
Wait!

1423
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:35,767
Give him another chance.

1424
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:39,688
He's through with chances.
Now, he has to pay
for his mistakes.

1425
01:12:39,981 --> 01:12:41,648
But I'm the one
who made all
the mistakes.

1426
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:44,568
I'm the one
who used the WABAC
without permission.

1427
01:12:44,736 --> 01:12:47,612
The only mistake
Mr. Peabody ever made...

1428
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:49,948
was me.

1429
01:12:51,159 --> 01:12:52,534
Sherman.

1430
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:55,287
You're absolutely
right, Sherman.

1431
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:59,583
What kind of a father
could this dog
ever be to a boy?

1432
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:04,171
Maybe you're right,
Ms. Grunion.

1433
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:06,548
But there's one thing
you haven't considered.

1434
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:07,799
What's that?

1435
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:11,344
I'm a dog, too!

1436
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:15,974
If being a dog
means you're like
Mr. Peabody...

1437
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:17,934
who never turns
his back on you...

1438
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:20,979
and who's always there
to pick you up
when you fall...

1439
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:25,275
and loves you no matter
how many times you mess up...

1440
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:27,736
if that's what it
means to be a dog...

1441
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:31,114
then, yeah, I'm a dog, too!

1442
01:13:33,034 --> 01:13:37,913
I'm a dog, too.

1443
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:40,874
I'm a dog, too!

1444
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:42,292
I'm a dog as well!

1445
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:43,919
A poodle dog!

1446
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:46,004
I am a dog, too.

1447
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:47,672
Ditto on that dog thing!

1448
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:52,344
I'm a dog, too.

1449
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:54,012
I am a dog as well.

1450
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:55,305
I'm a dog, too.

1451
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:56,556
I'm a dog, too.

1452
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:07,526
I'm a dog, too.

1453
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:16,785
I'm Spartacus!

1454
01:14:17,245 --> 01:14:21,164
All right, fine,
you're all dogs, but
you can't change the law.

1455
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:23,208
I know someone who can.

1456
01:14:25,128 --> 01:14:27,048
George Washington.

1457
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:31,466
We hold these truths
to be self-evident...

1458
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:37,264
that all men, and some dogs,
are created equal.

1459
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:42,352
I hereby award Mr. Peabody
a presidential pardon.

1460
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,603
Me, too.

1461
01:14:43,771 --> 01:14:45,063
I've done worse.

1462
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:55,073
Huh?

1463
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:00,787
Uh, Mr. Peabody, look!

1464
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:07,836
Ahh!

1465
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:10,505
Ooh!

1466
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:15,260
It's getting closer!

1467
01:15:15,428 --> 01:15:16,720
What are we going to do?

1468
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:19,377
This is the greatest
collection of geniuses
ever assembled!

1469
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:22,309
Surely we can come
up with another way
of getting to the past.

1470
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:24,102
I can build a catapult.

1471
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:25,729
We go very fast.

1472
01:15:25,897 --> 01:15:28,982
But, remember,
as you approach
the speed of light...

1473
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:31,276
gravity will get too strong.

1474
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:34,779
Oh, indeed. "For every
action, there is an equal
and opposite reaction."

1475
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:38,575
How about we just punch
that big hole in the face?

1476
01:15:47,627 --> 01:15:49,252
I have an idea.

1477
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:52,380
Hey, everybody, I have an idea!

1478
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:53,673
Yes, what is it, Sherman?

1479
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:56,760
Why not go to the future?

1480
01:15:57,178 --> 01:15:58,261
The future?

1481
01:15:58,429 --> 01:16:02,807
I've never been there
before, so it's probably
not as messed up.

1482
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:05,143
Sherman, that's it!

1483
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:06,978
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

1484
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:08,355
Not usually.

1485
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:10,815
It's exactly what
you all just said...

1486
01:16:11,234 --> 01:16:13,235
except the total opposite!

1487
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:17,364
If we set
the WABAC for the future,
and go very, very fast...

1488
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:19,741
we'll create our own
gravitational field...

1489
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,701
that's equal and opposite...

1490
01:16:21,869 --> 01:16:25,163
to the rip in
the space-time continuum!

1491
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,083
Oh, my...

1492
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:29,626
I don't get it.

1493
01:16:29,794 --> 01:16:33,380
We're gonna fly up there
and punch that big
hole in the face!

1494
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:34,798
Yes!

1495
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:39,469
Sherman, you're a genius.

1496
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,097
But, Peabody...

1497
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:44,891
how far into
the future must you go?

1498
01:16:45,059 --> 01:16:46,851
Just a few seconds
ought to do it,

1499
01:16:46,978 --> 01:16:48,728
and then we'll
slingshot right back.

1500
01:16:48,896 --> 01:16:50,772
Are you sure this
is going to work?

1501
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,399
Don't worry, Penny.

1502
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:54,651
Just remember,
I'm a...

1503
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:57,445
Genius!

1504
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:58,738
Sherman...

1505
01:16:58,823 --> 01:17:00,657
I need to reprogram the WABAC.

1506
01:17:00,825 --> 01:17:01,908
All right, Mr. Peabody.

1507
01:17:02,076 --> 01:17:04,119
That means you have to drive.

1508
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:34,952
In order to make the leap
into the future...

1509
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:36,860
the WABAC will
have to go very fast.

1510
01:17:37,028 --> 01:17:38,820
Faster than it's
ever gone before!

1511
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:41,906
Are you ready, Sherman?

1512
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:43,408
I'm ready.

1513
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,664
Come on, Sherman, you can do it.

1514
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:02,093
Now, Mr. Peabody?

1515
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:04,012
Sherman, we need more speed.

1516
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:08,475
Now?

1517
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:10,268
Just a little more!

1518
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:14,230
Not yet, Sherman.

1519
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:15,398
Not yet.

1520
01:18:16,484 --> 01:18:17,484
Now!

1521
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:54,354
Whoa! Whoa!

1522
01:18:54,772 --> 01:18:56,106
Farewell!

1523
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:05,740
Ooh!

1524
01:19:05,825 --> 01:19:08,076
You haven't seen
the last of me,
Peabody.

1525
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:11,454
You'll make
a mistake eventually,
and when you do...

1526
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:13,790
I'll be there!

1527
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:15,583
The Grunion is mine!
Ooh!

1528
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:39,441
Come on, Sherman. Come on!

1529
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:04,048
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

1530
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:30,909
If you want
to watch television
before I get home...

1531
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:33,077
simply press
"input" three times...

1532
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:34,454
and then use
the remote control
as usual.

1533
01:20:34,622 --> 01:20:35,622
Yes, Sherman.

1534
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:38,269
And if you're worried
about making friends
at the PTA meeting...

1535
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:39,876
consider bringing
snacks for everyone.

1536
01:20:40,044 --> 01:20:41,711
Bagels are always appreciated.

1537
01:20:41,879 --> 01:20:43,213
Yes, Sherman.

1538
01:20:44,423 --> 01:20:45,924
And remember,
Mr. Peabody...

1539
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:49,010
I have robotics club
after school today.

1540
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,554
Sherman, wait.

1541
01:20:51,722 --> 01:20:53,473
Yes, Mr. Peabody?

1542
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:56,518
I...

1543
01:20:57,895 --> 01:21:00,146
I love you, Sherman.

1544
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:07,111
I have a deep regard
for you as well,
Mr. Peabody.

1545
01:21:18,666 --> 01:21:19,874
Hey, Mr. Peabody!

1546
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:21,125
Hey, Sherman!

1547
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:22,502
Wait up!

1548
01:21:25,422 --> 01:21:26,839
No doubt about it.

1549
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:29,509
Every dog should have a boy.

1550
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:52,532
Oh!

1551
01:21:55,494 --> 01:21:57,829
Ooh!

1552
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,664
Ah!

1553
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:03,543
A-ha!

1554
01:22:17,308 --> 01:22:20,893
I now pronounce
you husband and wife.

1555
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:23,271
You may kiss the Grunion.

1556
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:26,816
Come here, soldier.

1557
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:44,334
There's always time for living

1558
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:47,712
Can we just do it again?

1559
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:54,719
One more time
like it once was
way back when

1560
01:22:56,305 --> 01:22:58,973
You gave me
something to believe in

1561
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:02,602
We were the best of friends

1562
01:23:03,896 --> 01:23:09,525
Well, I remember
the good times
way back when

1563
01:23:16,367 --> 01:23:20,995
Memories will fade
if you wanted me
to let you go

1564
01:23:23,791 --> 01:23:28,002
I've got you on your way
I feel it for you,
don't you know

1565
01:23:28,087 --> 01:23:30,713
We're superheroes and villains

1566
01:23:31,674 --> 01:23:34,008
When we used to pretend

1567
01:23:35,094 --> 01:23:41,182
We'd go wherever our minds
would take us way back when

1568
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:50,108
Memories will fade
if you wanted me
to let you go

1569
01:23:53,278 --> 01:23:57,448
I've got you on your way
I feel it for you,
don't you know

1570
01:24:00,411 --> 01:24:04,872
It's a promise that I made
Never be afraid

1571
01:24:08,127 --> 01:24:12,463
I know we'll be okay
This luck we have,
it cannot go

1572
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:15,591
'Cause you're on your own

1573
01:24:17,136 --> 01:24:19,470
You're not alone

1574
01:24:20,806 --> 01:24:26,436
I know I'll see you again Again

1575
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:30,732
And if all these things

1576
01:24:31,525 --> 01:24:34,444
Come to an end

1577
01:24:35,195 --> 01:24:39,991
We'll always have
a way back when

1578
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:51,085
Memories will fade
if you wanted me
to let you go

1579
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:58,676
I've got you on your way
I feel it for you,
don't you know

1580
01:25:01,555 --> 01:25:05,558
It's a promise that I made
Never be afraid

1581
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:13,900
I know we'll be okay
This luck we have,
it cannot go
