1
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:53,555
<i>Long ago,
the world was full of wonder.</i>

2
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:01,646
<i>It was adventurous...</i>

3
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:04,649
<i>exciting...</i>

4
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:08,736
<i>and best of all...</i>

5
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:10,905
<i>there was magic.</i>

6
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,325
<i>Boombastia!</i>

7
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:27,171
<i>And that magic
helped all in need.</i>

8
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:28,881
<i>Flame Infernar!</i>

9
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,393
<i>Voltar Thundasir!</i>

10
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:57,452
<i>But it wasn't easy
to master.</i>

11
00:01:58,411 --> 00:02:01,247
<i>And so the world found
a simpler way to get by.</i>

12
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:04,042
I call it the light bulb.

13
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:12,800
'Tis so easy.

14
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:14,552
Huh.

15
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:19,182
<i>Over time...</i>

16
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:22,977
<i>...magic faded away.</i>

17
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:42,914
<i>But I hope...</i>

18
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,754
<i>...there's
a little magic left...</i>

19
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:52,215
<i>in you.</i>

20
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:14,463
<i>All right.</i>

21
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:16,406
<i>We're gonna get
Warrior Z90 fit.</i>

22
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:18,167
<i>Let me hear you say,
"I'm a mighty warrior."</i>

23
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:19,700
I'm a mighty warrior.

24
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:21,244
Morning, Mom.

25
00:03:24,122 --> 00:03:26,040
Oh! Blazey, down!

26
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:28,626
Bad dragon! Back to your lair.

27
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:32,255
Happy birthday, Mr. Adult Man.

28
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,631
No, Mom.

29
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:36,426
Hey, buddy. Don't wipe off
my kisses.

30
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:37,844
What?

31
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,762
You're wearing
your dad's sweatshirt.

32
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:42,348
Oh. You know. Finally fits.

33
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,851
Aw, my little chubby cheeks
is all grown up!

34
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:47,937
Okay, okay. Mom, I gotta eat
something before school.

35
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:49,439
Ah, we don't have much food.

36
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,040
I still have to go
to the grocery store.

37
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,483
Ah, hands off, mister.

38
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:54,026
Those are
for your party tonight.

39
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:56,279
It's not a party, Mom.
It's just us.

40
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:58,402
You could invite those kids
from your science class.

41
00:03:58,448 --> 00:04:00,491
You said
they seem pretty rockin'.

42
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,743
I'm, uh, pretty sure
I didn't say it like that.

43
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:04,579
And besides,
I don't even know them.

44
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:06,873
Well, your birthday's a day
to try new things.

45
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:08,666
Be the new you.

46
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,168
Speaking of trying new things,

47
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,794
did you sign up
for driving practice?

48
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,546
No! No.

49
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:16,007
I know you're a little scared
to drive, sweetie pie, but...

50
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:18,885
I'm not scared, Mom.
I'm gonna move Barley's game.

51
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:21,155
Okay, but you know
how he gets when someone

52
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:22,472
touches that board.

53
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:25,057
Well, he's gotta learn
how to clean up his toys.

54
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,184
Halt!

55
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:30,146
Doth my brother dare disrupt
an active campaign?

56
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,856
Oh, come on!

57
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:33,024
You know, Ian,

58
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:34,358
in the days of old,
a boy of 16

59
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,693
would have
his strength tested

60
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:37,153
in the Swamps of Despair.

61
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:38,988
I'm not testing anything.
Just let me go.

62
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,488
Let him go.

63
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,532
Okay.

64
00:04:41,574 --> 00:04:42,634
But I know you're stronger
than that.

65
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:44,368
There's a mighty warrior
inside of you.

66
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,578
You just have to let him out.

67
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:47,205
Right, Mom?

68
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:48,432
Oh, that's good.

69
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:50,500
Barley! You stink!

70
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,894
When was the last time
you showered?

71
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:53,562
If you tried a little harder,
you actually could

72
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:55,630
probably wiggle out of this.

73
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:58,841
See? Mom knows how
to let out her inner warrior.

74
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,092
Thank you.

75
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:01,219
Now, take out the trash.

76
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,158
<i>Stay on the
lookout for a runaway griffin.</i>

77
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:07,725
Ah, Officer Bronco.

78
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:10,186
Barley, Barley, Barley.

79
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,480
Every time the city tries
to tear down

80
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:13,689
an old piece of rubble,

81
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:16,400
I gotta drag my rear end
out here and deal with you.

82
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:18,486
I don't know
what you're talking about.

83
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:20,029
Oh, really?

84
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:22,782
<i>I will not let you tear down
this fountain.</i>

85
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:25,368
<i>Ancient warriors
on grand quests</i>

86
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:27,370
<i>drank from its flowing water.</i>

87
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:29,622
Barley.

88
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:31,457
They're destroying
the town's past.

89
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:32,834
Ugh. Well, come on in.

90
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,335
Rest your haunches
for a minute.

91
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:35,545
Thank you, hon.

92
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:37,421
Ugh.

93
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,675
Hey there, birthday boy.

94
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:43,844
So, ya workin' hard
or hardly workin'?

95
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:46,055
I'm just, you know,
making toast.

96
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:47,265
I'm serious, Barley,

97
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:49,106
you need to start thinking
less about the past

98
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,768
and more about your future.

99
00:05:50,977 --> 00:05:52,436
Ah, she's right.

100
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:56,652
You can't spend all day
playing your board game.

101
00:05:58,234 --> 00:06:00,736
<i>Quests of Yore</i>
isn't just a board game.

102
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:04,031
It's a historically-based
role-playing scenario.

103
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:05,366
Did you know, in the old days,

104
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:08,202
centaurs could run
70 miles an hour?

105
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,037
I own a vehicle.
Don't need to run.

106
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,622
Well, Ian,
you could definitely

107
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:13,040
learn a lot
from <i>Quests of Yore.</i>

108
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,166
- You wanna play?
- I don't.

109
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,353
You could be
a crafty rogue or...

110
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:19,297
Ooh! I know!
You can be a wizard.

111
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,173
I shall cast a spell on thee!

112
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,633
Hey! Careful of
Dad's sweatshirt!

113
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:25,052
I don't even remember Dad
wearing that sweatshirt.

114
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:27,763
Well, you do only have,
like, two memories of him.

115
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:28,931
No, I've got three.

116
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:30,558
I remember
his beard was scratchy,

117
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,226
he had a goofy laugh,
and I used to play

118
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:33,829
- drums on his feet.
- Drums on his feet. Right.

119
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:34,979
I used to go...

120
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:38,691
- Whoa!
- Five-second rule. Hah!

121
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,295
It's okay.
You just got to pull it.

122
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,403
No!

123
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:43,779
Barley!

124
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:45,990
Uh, you know...

125
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:48,117
I'm just gonna get some food
on the way to school.

126
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,911
I'll sew that later tonight,
okay?

127
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:50,995
Wait, wait, wait.

128
00:06:51,037 --> 00:06:54,040
By the laws of yore,
I must dub thee a man today.

129
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:55,207
Kneel before me.

130
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,543
Oh! That's okay.
I gotta get going.

131
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:58,770
All right, well,
I'll pick you up later.

132
00:06:58,794 --> 00:06:59,855
We'll perform
the ceremony at school.

133
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:00,921
Oh! No, no, no, no.

134
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:02,632
Don't do that. Don't do that.
Okay, bye!

135
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:16,687
Hey!

136
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:17,772
Go Griffins!

137
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:18,856
What?

138
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:20,149
You go to Willowdale College?

139
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:22,193
Oh, no. This was my dad's.

140
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:24,820
Lightfoot?
Wilden Lightfoot?

141
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,030
Yeah.

142
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:27,716
You're kidding.
I went to college with him.

143
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,367
- Really?
- Yeah.

144
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:33,496
Boy, I was so sorry to hear
that he passed away.

145
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:35,706
Yeah. Thanks.

146
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:39,502
You know, your dad was
a great guy. So confident.

147
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:42,922
When he came into a room,
people noticed.

148
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:46,509
The man wore the ugliest
purple socks every single day.

149
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,760
What? Why?

150
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:49,637
Hey, that's exactly
what we asked.

151
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,472
But he was just bold.

152
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:53,808
I always wished I had
a little bit of that in me.

153
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:59,563
Yeah. Wow. I've never heard
any of this about him before.

154
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:01,691
- What else do you remember?
- Dad!

155
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:04,193
Oh, sorry. Gotta get this guy
off to school.

156
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,945
Hey, it was nice meeting you.

157
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:08,406
Yeah. You, too.

158
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:11,075
Huh.

159
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:13,577
Bold.

160
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,499
Okay, class.
Sit down. We're starting roll.

161
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:09,759
Hey, uh, Gorgamon. Um...

162
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:12,595
Would you mind not putting
your feet on my chair today?

163
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:13,721
Sorry, dude.

164
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:15,014
Got to keep them elevated.

165
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:16,682
Gets the blood flowing
to my brain.

166
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:19,769
It just makes it a little hard
for me to fit in there.

167
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:21,329
Well, if I don't have
good blood flow,

168
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,272
I can't concentrate
on my schoolwork.

169
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,566
You don't want me to do bad
in school, do you?

170
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:27,485
Uh...

171
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,320
No.

172
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,071
Thanks, bro.

173
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:36,386
First road test.

174
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,495
Any volunteers?

175
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:42,750
A left here.

176
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:47,379
Now, take this on-ramp
for the freeway.

177
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:51,509
Okay, yeah.
I'm, uh, super ready for that.

178
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:56,388
Uh...

179
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,266
It's nice and fast.

180
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:00,577
Just merge into traffic.

181
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,019
Yep.
Just any minute.

182
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:03,163
- Merge into traffic.
- Uh...

183
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:04,230
Merge into traffic!

184
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:06,816
I'm not ready!

185
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,109
Pull over.

186
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:14,323
All right. So, what should
we do this weekend?

187
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:15,658
Move to a cooler town?

188
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:17,034
Oh, hey.
What up, dudes? Um...

189
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:19,036
I'm, uh, having
a party tonight,

190
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:21,288
and I was wondering if
you wanted to come over

191
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:23,624
and get down on some cake.

192
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,751
That's not something
anyone says.

193
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:27,711
Okay, don't say "dudes."
"Gang"?

194
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:31,006
What's up, gang?

195
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:32,591
What's up, gang?

196
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:38,597
Hey.
What's up, gang?

197
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:41,225
Oh, hey. Uh, Ian, right?

198
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:43,811
Oh! I didn't know
you knew my...

199
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:45,354
Anyway...

200
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,648
uh, if you like parties,
then I'm...

201
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,191
I was gonna do a party...

202
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:50,627
- What?
- What I was trying to say is

203
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,003
if you're not doing
anything tonight...

204
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:54,227
but I'm sure you probably
are doing something tonight...

205
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,198
and you like cake
like I like cake,

206
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,742
I've got a cake at my house.

207
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:01,078
Are you inviting us
to a party?

208
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,246
That's the one.

209
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:04,081
Oh. Yeah, we don't have
any plans.

210
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:05,166
- Yeah, okay.
- Totally.

211
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:06,250
Really?

212
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:08,252
I guess we can just take
the bus over to my house.

213
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:12,798
Oh, no, no, no.

214
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,176
Ha-ha! Is that
the birthday boy I see?

215
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:22,766
Behold! Your chariot awaits!

216
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:24,226
Do you know that guy?

217
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:26,812
- Uh...
- Sir Iandore of Lightfoot.

218
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,981
Seems like he's talking
to you.

219
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,190
Hey, Ian!

220
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:33,611
Hey, Barley.

221
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:35,613
Yeah, we were actually gonna
take the bus.

222
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:37,406
The bus? Nay!

223
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,325
I will give you
and your companions

224
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,410
transport upon Guinevere.

225
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:43,245
Um, who's Guinevere?

226
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,539
My mighty steed.

227
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:47,791
Oh. That's embarrassing.

228
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:49,627
That's okay, girl.
Patch you back up.

229
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:52,504
He's just joking around.

230
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,049
You've got
something on your face.

231
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,553
Oh, no. You... just...
Wait, no. It's... No...

232
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:01,680
Oh! Uh...

233
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:02,824
You know what?
I just remembered

234
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:04,183
that my birthday
is, uh, canceled.

235
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,851
- What?
- I mean, the party.

236
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:07,353
Uh, it was never
actually happening.

237
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,914
It was just
this huge misunderstanding.

238
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:10,189
So, I got to go.

239
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,482
Okay. Bye!

240
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:22,368
Ooh. Whoops! Sorry.
Let me just file those.

241
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,496
Hey, did those kids write
on your face?

242
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,122
Here. I'll get it.

243
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:29,416
Can we please just go home?

244
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,127
Okay, well, we'll perform
your birthday ceremony later.

245
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:33,629
Then you'll be ready
for adulthood

246
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:35,172
and its gauntlet
of challenges.

247
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:36,423
You know, in ancient times,

248
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:37,525
you celebrated
your day of birth

249
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:38,592
with a solemn quest.

250
00:12:39,385 --> 00:12:41,679
Of course, those were nothing
compared to the challenges

251
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,180
of the old days.

252
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:48,435
Mom?

253
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:50,646
Mom?

254
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:38,068
<i>Will, you're not gonna
get that thing working.</i>

255
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,278
<i>I think I've got it.</i>

256
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,755
<i>I'm gonna watch
from over here</i>

257
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,781
<i>for when it blows up.</i>

258
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:43,949
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

259
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,927
<i>I'll bet good money
you can't get it to work.</i>

260
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:46,994
<i>Oh, is that right?</i>

261
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:48,078
<i>Yep.</i>

262
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,222
<i>But you're doing a good job of</i>

263
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:50,890
<i>making it look like you know
what you're doing.</i>

264
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,583
<i>Well, I'm trying to.</i>

265
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,293
<i>Did you check
if it had batteries?</i>

266
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:56,479
<i>Of course you didn't.</i>

267
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:57,546
<i>I know.</i>

268
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:58,648
<i>So, is it really working?</i>

269
00:13:58,672 --> 00:13:59,715
<i>Let's find out.</i>

270
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:02,676
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

271
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:10,017
<i>Will, you're not going
to get that thing working.</i>

272
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:11,185
<i>I think I've got it.</i>

273
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:12,853
<i>I'm gonna watch
from over here</i>

274
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:14,438
<i>for when it blows up.</i>

275
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:15,689
Hi, Dad.

276
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,316
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

277
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:18,484
It's me, Ian.

278
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:19,568
<i>Oh, is that right?</i>

279
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,904
Yeah.
Did you have a good day?

280
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,447
<i>Well, I'm trying to.</i>

281
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,199
Yeah. Me, too.

282
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:27,743
Although, I could clearly use
some help.

283
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:32,664
I sure do wish I could spend
the day with you sometime.

284
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,916
<i>I know.</i>

285
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,709
Well, there are so many things
we could do.

286
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:37,211
I bet it'd be really fun.

287
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:38,754
<i>Let's find out.</i>

288
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:40,881
Yeah. I mean, I'd love to.
We could, uh...

289
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:43,300
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

290
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,428
Yeah.

291
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:48,055
Bye.

292
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:55,729
Oh, my...

293
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:58,399
Barley, keep your soldiers
off my land

294
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,983
or our kingdoms
will go to war!

295
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:01,652
Sorry, Mom!

296
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,446
Oh, this is the world's
longest gap year.

297
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:06,698
Honey, I was gonna do that.

298
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:07,908
It's okay.

299
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,953
Wow! You must have been taught
by some kind of sewing master.

300
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:14,331
Yeah. A very humble
sewing master.

301
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:23,340
What was Dad like
when he was my age?

302
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:25,217
Was he always super confident?

303
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:26,593
Oh, no.

304
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:29,513
It took him a while
to find out who he was.

305
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:32,349
I wish I'd met him.

306
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,144
Oh, me, too.

307
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:39,231
But, hey, you know,
when your dad got sick,

308
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:40,774
he fought so hard

309
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:43,694
because he wanted to meet you
more than anything.

310
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,034
You know what?
I have something for you.

311
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:55,205
I was gonna wait
until after cake,

312
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:57,457
but I think you've waited
long enough.

313
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:58,542
What is it?

314
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,795
It's a gift from your dad.

315
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:08,802
What do you mean,
it's from Dad?

316
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:10,846
I don't know. Mom said
it was for both of us.

317
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,264
What is it?

318
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:17,144
He just said to give you this
when you were both over 16.

319
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:21,398
I have no idea what it is.

320
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:29,823
No way!

321
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,325
It's a wizard staff.

322
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,743
- Dad was a wizard.
- What?

323
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:35,120
Hold on, your dad was
an accountant.

324
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:37,498
I mean, he got interested
in a lot of strange things

325
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:38,749
when he got sick, but...

326
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,000
There's a letter.

327
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,835
"Dear Ian and Barley,

328
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,296
"long ago, the world
was full of wonder.

329
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:46,465
"It was adventurous,
exciting,

330
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,467
"and best of all,
there was magic.

331
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,594
"And that magic
helped all in need.

332
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,262
"But it wasn't easy to master.

333
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:54,932
"And so the world found
a simpler way to get by.

334
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:57,434
"Over time,
magic faded away,

335
00:16:57,518 --> 00:17:01,939
"but I hope there's
a little magic left in you.

336
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:05,067
"And so I wrote this spell,
so I could see for myself

337
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:08,111
"who my boys grew up to be."

338
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,531
"Visitation Spell."

339
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,912
I don't believe this.

340
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,914
This spell brings him back.

341
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:21,250
For one whole day,
Dad will be back.

342
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,001
- What?
- Back? Like back to life?

343
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,086
That's not possible.

344
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,796
It is with this!

345
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,882
I'm gonna meet Dad?

346
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:31,885
Oh, Will, you wonderful nut.
What is this?

347
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,721
Now, a spell this powerful
needs an assist element.

348
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,366
And, I mean, for this to work,
Dad would've had to find

349
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,141
a Phoenix Gem!

350
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:39,518
Wow.

351
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,311
There's only
a few of these left.

352
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,397
Hold on! Is this dangerous?

353
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:45,607
We're about to find out.

354
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,653
- Ah!
- What?

355
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:51,571
Splinter.

356
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:56,660
"Only once is all we get,
grant me this rebirth.

357
00:17:56,702 --> 00:18:01,123
"Till tomorrow's sun has set,
one day to walk the earth."

358
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:07,504
Hold on.
I was just grippin' it wrong.

359
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:11,258
"Only once is all we get,
grant me this rebirth.

360
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,137
"Till tomorrow's sun has set,
one day to walk the earth."

361
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:17,180
"Only once is all we get,

362
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:18,765
"grant me this rebirth.

363
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,077
"Till tomorrow's sun has set,
one day to walk the earth."

364
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,477
"One day to walk the earth."

365
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:26,690
"Till tomorrow's sun has set,
one day to walk the earth."

366
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:28,066
Barley.

367
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,744
I'm sorry you guys
don't have your dad here,

368
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:44,291
but this shows just how much
he wanted to see you both.

369
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:47,085
So much
that he'd try anything.

370
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,380
That's still
a pretty special gift.

371
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,174
Yeah.

372
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:02,309
Hey, wanna come with me
to pick up your cake?

373
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:04,936
That's okay. Thanks, Mom.

374
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:37,928
"Only once is all we get,
grant me this rebirth.

375
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:45,477
"Till tomorrow's sun
has set...

376
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,861
"one day to walk the earth."

377
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:00,885
Hey, man,
what are you doing in here?

378
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,953
Holy Tooth of Zadar!
How did you...?

379
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,287
I don't know. It just started.

380
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:12,337
Whoa! Feet!

381
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,859
Hang on. I can help!

382
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,943
Barley, no!

383
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,843
Dad?

384
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:04,505
He's just legs.

385
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:07,809
There's no top part.

386
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:09,537
I definitely remember
Dad having a top part!

387
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,897
Oh, what did I do?
This is horrible.

388
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:14,983
Uh...

389
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,532
Hello?

390
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:26,995
It's really him.

391
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:29,664
Dad, you are in your house.

392
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:30,749
Whoa, whoa!

393
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:35,003
He can't hear us.

394
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:43,470
What are you doing?

395
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:03,281
That's right, Dad.
It's me, Barley.

396
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:14,709
Yeah, that's Ian.

397
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,003
Hi, Dad.

398
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:27,806
I messed
this whole thing up.

399
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,432
Now he's gonna be
legs forever.

400
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:32,602
No, not forever.
The spell only lasts one day.

401
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:35,039
At sunset tomorrow,
he'll disappear,

402
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,943
and we'll never be able
to bring him back again.

403
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:40,694
Okay, okay, okay. 24 hours.

404
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:42,279
That doesn't give us
much time, but...

405
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:49,452
Well, we'll just have to do
the spell again.

406
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:50,954
You mean you have to.

407
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:53,665
A person can only do magic
if they have the gift.

408
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:55,307
And my little brother
has the magic gift.

409
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,876
Okay! Okay.

410
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:58,962
But I couldn't even finish
the spell.

411
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:01,006
Well, you're gonna have
plenty of time to practice.

412
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:03,300
'Cause we have to find
another Phoenix Gem.

413
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:11,766
A-ha! We'll start at the place
where all quests begin.

414
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:13,810
The Manticore's Tavern.

415
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:15,979
It's run
by a fearless adventurer.

416
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:17,415
She knows where to find
any kind of gem,

417
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:18,523
talisman, totem...

418
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,275
Barley, this is for a game.

419
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:21,818
Based on real life.

420
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:23,236
How do we know this tavern

421
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:24,654
- is still there?
- It's there.

422
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:26,489
Look, my years of training
have prepared me

423
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:27,824
for this very moment.

424
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:29,951
And I'm telling you,
this is the only way

425
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:32,787
to find a Phoenix Gem.

426
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:35,540
Trust me.

427
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:42,797
Whatever it takes,
I am gonna meet my dad.

428
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:45,842
You hear that, Dad?
We're going on a quest.

429
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:51,556
Come on, Guinevere.

430
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:54,017
Uh, maybe we should
just take the bus.

431
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,269
She's fine.

432
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,668
Anyway, it's just, like,

433
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:22,003
this award for math.
It's no big deal.

434
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:24,339
But I'll show you
when we get back home.

435
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:27,384
Hey, uh, what are you two

436
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:28,718
Chatty Charlies up to
back there?

437
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,804
You know, I felt weird
talking to Dad

438
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:33,098
without a top half, so...

439
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:34,599
ta-da!

440
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:36,685
Oh, that's great!

441
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:38,937
Dad, you look
just like I remember.

442
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:40,122
Hey, don't worry, we'll have

443
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:41,540
the rest of you here
before you know it.

444
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:42,982
And then,
first thing I'm gonna do,

445
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:45,068
introduce you to Guinevere.

446
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,278
Rebuilt this old girl myself,

447
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,239
from the lug nuts
to the air conditioning.

448
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:56,287
Showing Dad your van?

449
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:58,623
- That's your whole list?
- What list?

450
00:24:58,665 --> 00:24:59,874
- Oh.
- What's that?

451
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:01,543
I'm just working
on a list of things

452
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:02,627
I wanted to do with Dad.

453
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:03,712
You know,

454
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,673
play catch, take a walk,
driving lesson,

455
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,842
share my whole life story
with him.

456
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:10,343
That's cool.

457
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:13,304
Oh. But before you cast Dad's
spell again, you're gonna

458
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:15,724
have to practice your magic.

459
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:17,809
This book is for a game.

460
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:20,270
I told you,
everything in <i>Quests of Yore</i>

461
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:21,855
is historically accurate.

462
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:23,314
Even the spells.

463
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:26,484
So start practicing,
young sorcerer.

464
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:30,780
Okay, Dad.
Let's try some magic.

465
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,578
Hey, sweetie?

466
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:39,914
Ugh! Blazey. Oh, this dragon
is always under my feet.

467
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:42,333
Honey, you want some cake?

468
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:23,374
<i>Aloft Elevar. Aloft Elevar.</i>

469
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,627
I can't get
this levitation spell to work.

470
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:27,545
Maybe I could try
something else

471
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:29,255
like Arcane Lightning?

472
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:31,090
Yeah, like a level-one mage
could bust out

473
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:32,735
the hardest spell in
the <i>Enchanter's Guide Book.</i>

474
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,570
Maybe we'll stick
with the easy ones.

475
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:37,055
Yeah, well, it's not working.
Am I saying it wrong?

476
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:39,224
Well, mmm, you said it right.

477
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:40,725
It's just,
for any spell to work,

478
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,644
you have to speak
from your heart's fire.

479
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,479
- My what?
- Your heart's fire.

480
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:47,482
You must speak with passion.
Don't hold back.

481
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:49,817
<i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

482
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:52,488
No, like <i>Aloft Elevar.</i>

483
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:53,947
<i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

484
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:56,157
No, from your heart's fire!

485
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:58,660
<i>- Aloft Elevar!</i>
- Don't hold back.

486
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,328
<i>- Aloft Elevar!</i>
- Heart's fire!

487
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,913
Stop saying "heart's fire."

488
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:04,916
This just clearly
isn't working.

489
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:09,337
Hey, it was a good start.

490
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:19,055
Oh. Gather your courage, men.
We've arrived.

491
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:21,641
The Manticore's Tavern.

492
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:24,018
Huh. It is still here.

493
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,186
Yeah, I told you.

494
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:34,696
Come on, Dad. That's good.

495
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:38,700
All right, listen.
First, let me do the talking.

496
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:40,493
Secondly, it's crucial we show

497
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:42,078
the Manticore
the respect she deserves,

498
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,914
or she will, thirdly, not give
us a map to the Phoenix Gem.

499
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:46,457
Wait, wait, wait. The map?

500
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:48,167
I thought she had
a Phoenix Gem.

501
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:50,670
You're so cute.
Hear that, Dad?

502
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:52,815
He's a smart kid, he just
doesn't know how quests work.

503
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:55,550
Well, is there anything else
you're forgetting to tell me?

504
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:57,385
Mmm. No.

505
00:27:57,427 --> 00:27:58,553
<i>♪ Happy happy birthday</i>

506
00:27:58,595 --> 00:27:59,929
<i>♪ Come join us on a quest</i>

507
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:02,307
<i>♪ To make your birthday party
The very, very best</i>

508
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,474
<i>♪ Hey! ♪</i>

509
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:05,310
Okay, okay, so the tavern

510
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:06,579
changed a little
over the years,

511
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:09,564
but the Manticore
is still the real deal.

512
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:13,169
I'll have the soup of the day.

513
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:15,195
Would my lord
like a cup or cauldron?

514
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,452
Madam, I request an audience
with the Manticore.

515
00:28:22,577 --> 00:28:24,204
But of course, milord.

516
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:27,874
Oh, Manticore!

517
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:34,839
No. No, no, no.
The real Manticore.

518
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:37,133
The fearless adventurer.

519
00:28:37,175 --> 00:28:39,135
Oh. You mean Corey?
She's over there.

520
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,013
Quick!
Somebody help me.

521
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:43,741
These griffin nuggets were
supposed to go out

522
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:45,558
minutes ago.

523
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:48,144
That's the Manticore?

524
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:50,438
Oh, great and powerful
Manticore.

525
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:52,565
Whoa! Sir, you're right
in the hot zone.

526
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:53,900
You're late, Adolphus.

527
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:57,862
I understand there's traffic.
You need to plan for that.

528
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:02,283
Well, maybe your mother should
get her own car!

529
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:03,910
Your fearlessness?

530
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:06,579
My brother and I seek a map
to a Phoenix Gem.

531
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:09,707
Oh! Well, you've come to
the right tavern. Table 12.

532
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:13,878
I have the parchment
you desire right here. Behold!

533
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:16,547
Oh. That's a children's menu.

534
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:19,175
Isn't that fun? They're all
based on my old maps.

535
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,343
Uh, now...

536
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:21,761
The great Manticore sends you

537
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:23,429
on your adventure
with a hero's blessing.

538
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:24,514
And here's some crayons.

539
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:27,517
That's very amusing,
your dominance,

540
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:29,185
but might you have
the real map?

541
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,521
Uh, yeah.
It's, uh, over there.

542
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:34,941
That's it.

543
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:36,901
- This is perfect.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

544
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:38,903
What are you doing?
You can't take this.

545
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,613
We have to.

546
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:42,490
What is that?

547
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:45,761
It's our dad. And we have
a chance to meet him, but...

548
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:48,246
But we can't do that
without a Phoenix Gem.

549
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:51,749
No! My days of sending people
on dangerous quests are over.

550
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:52,875
What? Why?

551
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:54,311
'Cause they're dangerous.

552
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:57,005
Corey, the karaoke machine's
broken again.

553
00:29:57,213 --> 00:30:00,883
I'm sorry, but you are
not getting this map.

554
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:03,428
Don't worry, ladies,

555
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:04,905
your adventure will continue
momentarily.

556
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:06,556
Okay, I can handle this.

557
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:08,433
No, Ian.

558
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:11,978
Miss mighty Manticore,
ma'am...

559
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,187
What are you doing?

560
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,064
Kid, this is not a good time.

561
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:17,150
Ugh. I'm giving this place
a one-star review.

562
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:19,986
It's just,
I've never met my dad and...

563
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:21,237
Look, I'm sorry about that.

564
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,072
But if you get hurt
on one of my quests,

565
00:30:23,114 --> 00:30:25,491
guess who gets sued
and loses her tavern?

566
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:27,243
I can't take
that kind of risk.

567
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:30,413
Now, if you'll just excuse me,
I have important things to do.

568
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:31,849
Testing.

569
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:33,875
<i>♪ You haunt my dreams</i>

570
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,251
<i>♪ My inbetweens ♪</i>

571
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:37,587
Please, we need that map.

572
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:39,005
No, I am not giving you
the map.

573
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:40,590
That's it! I am done talking.

574
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:43,509
- Well, I'm not!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

575
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:45,803
You say you can't risk
losing this place.

576
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:47,096
Look at that Manticore.

577
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:49,265
She looks
like she lived to take risks.

578
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:52,101
That Manticore didn't have
investors to look out for.

579
00:30:52,143 --> 00:30:53,686
She didn't have payroll
to cover.

580
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:55,646
She could just
fly out the door

581
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:57,333
whenever she wanted
and slay a magma beast.

582
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:59,359
Are you gonna fix
the machine or not?

583
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,568
Yeah, in a minute.

584
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,361
Okay, maybe this place isn't

585
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:04,364
as adventurous
as it used to be.

586
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:06,199
So it isn't filled
with a motley horde

587
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,909
willing to risk life and limb

588
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,036
for the mere taste
of excitement.

589
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:11,829
But so what?

590
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:13,716
Who ever said
you have to take risks in life

591
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:15,041
to have an adventure?

592
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:17,585
Apparently, you did.

593
00:31:22,507 --> 00:31:25,426
Table 32 said their
mozzarella sticks are cold.

594
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:28,137
What have I done?

595
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:29,514
Well, it's not too late.

596
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:30,824
I mean, you could just
give us the map.

597
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:32,100
This place
used to be dangerous.

598
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:33,202
Dangerous!

599
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:34,769
- And wild!
- Wild!

600
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:37,647
I used to be
dangerous and wild!

601
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:40,733
Dangerous and wild!

602
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:46,406
Wow.

603
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:50,493
I'm living a lie!
What have I become?

604
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:53,621
Oh, no.

605
00:31:55,456 --> 00:31:57,083
Everybody out!

606
00:31:57,125 --> 00:32:00,753
This tavern is closed
for remodeling.

607
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:13,850
Sorry, the karaoke machine
is broken!

608
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:20,314
Oh.

609
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:24,777
No! No, no, no!

610
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:25,945
No.

611
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:27,029
We gotta go!

612
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:38,166
<i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

613
00:32:49,594 --> 00:32:52,346
That was unbelievable.

614
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:54,028
I mean, you were just like...

615
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:55,683
and the beam
was just floating there!

616
00:32:55,725 --> 00:32:57,602
My brother is a wizard.

617
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:59,604
I can't believe that worked.

618
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:02,023
Oh! You're gonna nail
Dad's spell now.

619
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:03,774
Except we don't have a map.

620
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:06,944
But we've got this. Behold!

621
00:33:08,237 --> 00:33:10,448
Look, on a quest, you have
to use what you've got.

622
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,074
And this is what we've got.

623
00:33:12,116 --> 00:33:15,453
Best part is, little Kayla
already solved the puzzle.

624
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,496
Well, according to Kayla,

625
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:19,999
we just have to look
for Raven's Point.

626
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:24,378
Raven's Point. Raven's Point.

627
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:26,756
Yes! The gem
must be in the mountain.

628
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:28,233
We could be there
by tomorrow morning.

629
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:29,467
Tomorrow morning?

630
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:31,636
That still gives us
plenty of time with Dad.

631
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:37,016
Yeah. Well, it looks like

632
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:38,851
the expressway should take us
right there.

633
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:43,397
Mmm. Expressway is
a little too obvious.

634
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:45,900
On a quest, the clear path
is never the right one.

635
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:46,984
What?

636
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:48,611
During one
<i>Quests of Yore</i> campaign,

637
00:33:48,653 --> 00:33:50,571
Shrub Rosehammer and I
took the easy route,

638
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:53,532
led him straight into the
belly of a gelatinous cube.

639
00:33:53,658 --> 00:33:55,534
Only reason
I didn't suffer the same fate?

640
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:56,953
I followed my gut.

641
00:33:56,994 --> 00:34:00,373
And it's telling me
we take an ancient trail

642
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:02,917
called the Path of Peril.

643
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:04,835
But the expressway
is faster.

644
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:06,212
Maybe not in the long run.

645
00:34:06,337 --> 00:34:07,630
I know you want this to be

646
00:34:07,672 --> 00:34:09,507
like one of
your adventure games,

647
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:10,800
but all that matters

648
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:12,510
is that we get to spend
as much time

649
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,220
as possible with Dad.

650
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:22,270
So, we should just take
the expressway, right?

651
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:26,065
Yeah, you're right.

652
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:28,192
But if you end up
inside a gelatinous cube,

653
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:30,570
you are on your own.

654
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:45,334
<i>Manticore's Tavern</i>

655
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,919
<i>ahead on your right.</i>

656
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,215
- Hey.
<i>- I'm just checking in.</i>

657
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:52,550
<i>Did you catch up
to the boys yet?</i>

658
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:53,634
No, not yet.

659
00:34:53,676 --> 00:34:55,344
But I'm a little worried
because we had

660
00:34:55,386 --> 00:34:57,555
a weird family issue
come up,

661
00:34:57,597 --> 00:35:00,600
and, well, this just isn't
like Ian to run off.

662
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:02,435
I mean, Barley, yes,
but not Ian.

663
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:03,561
You know, it's late,

664
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,396
you shouldn't have to be out
looking for 'em.

665
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:06,981
I know, it's silly.

666
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:09,358
I'm sure they're both
probably on fire.

667
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,944
<i>- Fire?</i>
- Fire! The place is on fire!

668
00:35:11,986 --> 00:35:13,696
- My boys! I gotta go!
<i>- Laurel!</i>

669
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:15,906
Get it off, get it off,
get it off!

670
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,074
Excuse me. Hello?

671
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:19,452
Please, I'm looking for
two teenage elves.

672
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:21,954
I told you already,
there were two teenage elves.

673
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:24,498
Oh! Those are my sons.
Where did they go?

674
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:26,839
Oh. They went on a quest
to find a Phoenix Gem.

675
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:28,020
But don't worry, don't worry.

676
00:35:28,044 --> 00:35:30,105
I told them about the map,
I told them about the gem,

677
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:31,422
I told them about the curse.

678
00:35:31,464 --> 00:35:33,066
I forgot to tell them
about the curse.

679
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,425
- The what?
- Oh, boy.

680
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:36,344
Listen, this one's gone
a little...

681
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:39,138
Your boys are in grave danger!
But I can help!

682
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:40,890
Whoa, hey, hey!

683
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:43,976
You're not going anywhere.
We got questions for you.

684
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:46,687
I know where they're going!
We can still save them!

685
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:48,908
Okay, I think
everything's good here.

686
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:53,903
Last name "Manticore",
first name "The".

687
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:56,697
Hold on, you're right. She has
gone a little...

688
00:35:56,739 --> 00:35:59,700
It's no wonder
with a wound like that.

689
00:36:00,618 --> 00:36:01,952
That's just a scratch.

690
00:36:02,787 --> 00:36:04,389
Oh, I'm sorry, are you
an expert on minotaurs?

691
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:05,623
- Manticores.
- Manticores?

692
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:06,707
Well, no...

693
00:36:06,749 --> 00:36:07,917
Well, then you wouldn't know

694
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,752
that when their blood
is exposed to air,

695
00:36:09,794 --> 00:36:11,087
it makes them go bonkers.

696
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:12,254
I don't think that's true.

697
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:14,632
See? She's already
losing her grip on reality.

698
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,217
So, why don't you let me
save her life

699
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:17,635
before it costs you yours?

700
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,303
- Okay.
- Thank you.

701
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:21,430
Could we have
a little privacy here, please?

702
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:23,391
Just lie back. That's good.

703
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:25,059
But get your head
a little bit higher.

704
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:27,645
Just don't take too long
back there, okay?

705
00:36:28,312 --> 00:36:29,689
Hey, you hear me?

706
00:36:30,523 --> 00:36:31,875
I said don't take too long
back there,

707
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:33,234
because...

708
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:37,696
All right,
how do we help my boys?

709
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,574
Ooh! I'm gonna like you.

710
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:43,452
Radio, headlights, brakes,

711
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:44,912
tires, rims.

712
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:46,539
I mean,
it's hard to tell now, Dad,

713
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,683
before I replaced her parts,

714
00:36:47,707 --> 00:36:49,547
Guinevere was actually
kind of a piece of junk.

715
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,841
Looks like we're not gonna get
to do everything today, Dad.

716
00:36:58,259 --> 00:36:59,385
That's okay.

717
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:01,720
I just wanna meet you.

718
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:07,935
But don't worry,
we'll, uh, have you fixed up

719
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:09,520
and back home to see...

720
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:11,021
Oh, man. Mom!

721
00:37:11,522 --> 00:37:12,624
Barley, we're not
gonna be able

722
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:14,775
to get Dad back in time
to see Mom.

723
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:15,985
Oh.

724
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,904
Well, Dad, at least you won't
have to meet the new guy.

725
00:37:18,946 --> 00:37:22,158
So, you workin'
hard or hardly workin'?

726
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:24,535
Yeah.

727
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:26,120
Barley, Barley, Barley.

728
00:37:26,162 --> 00:37:28,122
Every time there's trouble,
I gotta deal with you.

729
00:37:28,164 --> 00:37:29,266
Is that your Colt?

730
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,332
Yeah.

731
00:37:30,374 --> 00:37:31,709
You're gonna wanna work
on that.

732
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:34,211
No, no, no!
Come on, old girl.

733
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,238
I thought you said
you fixed the van.

734
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:45,181
Relax. Guinevere is fine.

735
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:46,582
Her stomach
is just a little empty.

736
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:48,243
But it says
we have a full tank.

737
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:50,311
No. That doesn't work.

738
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:58,819
Oh. Only a few drops left.

739
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:01,947
Maybe if
there's a gas station...

740
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,162
Hmm.

741
00:38:15,002 --> 00:38:17,505
Is there a magic way
to get gas?

742
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:21,050
Oh! I like
your thinking, young mage.

743
00:38:23,803 --> 00:38:24,845
Growth spell!

744
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:26,931
We grow the can,
and then the gas inside

745
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,140
will grow with it.

746
00:38:28,182 --> 00:38:30,768
Uh, that's kind of
a weird idea.

747
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,645
I know! I like it, too.

748
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:33,729
Okay.

749
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:36,524
Loosen up. Heart's fire.
Here we go.

750
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:39,276
Whoa. It's not that simple.

751
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:40,611
This one learns
a little magic,

752
00:38:40,653 --> 00:38:42,112
thinks he's Shamblefoot
the Wondrous,

753
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:43,614
am I right, Dad?

754
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:45,991
A growth spell
is a bit more advanced.

755
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:48,285
Not only do you have to speak
from your heart's fire,

756
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:50,663
but now you also
have to follow a magic decree.

757
00:38:50,704 --> 00:38:51,747
A magic what?

758
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:54,959
It's a special rule that keeps
the spell working right.

759
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,086
This one states,
"To magnify an object,

760
00:38:57,127 --> 00:39:00,464
"you have to magnify
your attention upon it."

761
00:39:00,923 --> 00:39:02,466
While you cast the spell,

762
00:39:02,508 --> 00:39:04,760
you can't let anything
distract you.

763
00:39:04,885 --> 00:39:06,011
Okay.

764
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:07,096
Ow!

765
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:08,222
- What?
- Splinter.

766
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:09,598
Can we sand this thing down?

767
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,933
No. It's an ancient staff

768
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:12,768
with magic
in every glorious fiber.

769
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:14,186
You can't sand it down.

770
00:39:14,228 --> 00:39:17,815
All right. All right.
Here we go. Focus.

771
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,609
- Uh...
- Something wrong?

772
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,362
Sorry, it's just,
your stance is, uh... Here.

773
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:25,322
Chin up, elbows out,
feet apart,

774
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:26,907
back slightly arched.

775
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:28,784
- Okay, how's that feel?
- Great.

776
00:39:28,826 --> 00:39:30,452
- Oh, one more thing...
- Barley!

777
00:39:30,494 --> 00:39:31,704
Okay, okay.

778
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:38,002
<i>Magnora Gantuan!</i>

779
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,214
Don't let the magic spook you.

780
00:39:42,256 --> 00:39:43,299
Okay.

781
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:45,634
- Elbows!
- What?

782
00:39:45,676 --> 00:39:46,719
Elbows up!

783
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,280
No, no, no, it's too high.
That's too high.

784
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:49,555
I'm trying to focus here.

785
00:39:49,597 --> 00:39:51,717
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Focus. Focus on the can.

786
00:39:52,266 --> 00:39:53,809
Focus.

787
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:56,604
Focus.

788
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,564
Barley! Ah!
Forget it!

789
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,985
It worked!

790
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,820
The can is huge.

791
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:07,114
And the van is huge.

792
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:08,240
And you're...

793
00:40:08,282 --> 00:40:09,325
Oh, no.

794
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:11,086
- What happened?
- Looks like you shrunk me.

795
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:12,161
How?

796
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:14,330
Well, if you mess up a spell,
there are consequences.

797
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:16,558
I only messed up because you
wouldn't stop bothering me.

798
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:17,666
I was trying to help you.

799
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:18,871
Well, don't try to help me.

800
00:40:19,043 --> 00:40:21,170
Oh, okay. Fine. I won't!

801
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:23,589
Whoa, whoa. Dad, it's me.

802
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,675
Whoa! Dad, it's okay.
Don't worry.

803
00:40:26,717 --> 00:40:27,885
I'm gonna fix this.

804
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:30,429
Well, where are you going?

805
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:31,847
To find a gas station.

806
00:40:31,889 --> 00:40:33,599
- Well, I'm going, too.
- Fine.

807
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:35,017
Hey, I don't need your help.

808
00:40:35,476 --> 00:40:37,061
Fine with me.

809
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,065
Oh.

810
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:53,535
I just need a little break.

811
00:40:53,577 --> 00:40:55,412
My baby legs
can't go that fast.

812
00:40:57,998 --> 00:41:00,125
Look, a gas station.

813
00:41:00,376 --> 00:41:01,543
Good.

814
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:04,004
Oh, wait, I forgot.

815
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:05,673
You don't need my help.

816
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:09,968
Hey, I don't need you to
carry me. I'm a grown man.

817
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:13,013
Dad!

818
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:15,808
Come on, it's okay.
Barley is with me.

819
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:17,101
Yeah, I'm fine, Dad.

820
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,120
The side effects are supposed
to wear off eventually.

821
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,312
Do I look any bigger yet?

822
00:41:38,372 --> 00:41:40,290
Hey! Did you
just bump into me?

823
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:42,334
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't see you there.

824
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:45,254
Do it again, and you'll see me
in your nightmares.

825
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:01,770
This one's lucky. I know it.

826
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:05,107
Give me a bag of extra-sours.
Keep the change.

827
00:42:05,733 --> 00:42:07,693
Outta the way, beanstalk.

828
00:42:09,153 --> 00:42:11,530
Uh, 10 on pump two, please.

829
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:15,701
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting us food.

830
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:17,661
All right, I got it.

831
00:42:17,786 --> 00:42:19,997
And a couple of these.
Thank you.

832
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:22,166
Psst. I have to
go to the bathroom.

833
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:23,250
Can it wait?

834
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:24,793
It's your pocket.

835
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,129
Can we have the bathroom key,
please?

836
00:42:27,755 --> 00:42:29,590
Okay, be quick.
I want to get out of here.

837
00:42:29,757 --> 00:42:31,550
Okay, I'm goin'.

838
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,927
That'll be 12.99.

839
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,096
Hey, watch it!

840
00:42:36,138 --> 00:42:38,140
You got a problem, Shades?

841
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:41,560
Answer me
when I'm talking to you.

842
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:43,729
I'm sorry,
I don't really know

843
00:42:43,771 --> 00:42:45,189
where his head's at right now.

844
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:47,107
How could this night
get any worse?

845
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:52,112
You know, I would
fly us to help your boys,

846
00:42:52,154 --> 00:42:54,656
but the old wings
aren't what they used to be.

847
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:56,909
Oh, that's fine.
So, about this curse...

848
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,077
It's my own fault.

849
00:42:58,202 --> 00:42:59,787
I should be doing
my wing exercises

850
00:42:59,828 --> 00:43:01,389
every morning,
but you know how that goes.

851
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:03,624
Please, the curse.
What does it do?

852
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:06,335
Right. Sorry.
It's a Guardian Curse.

853
00:43:07,461 --> 00:43:10,839
If your boys take the gem,
the curse will rise up

854
00:43:10,964 --> 00:43:13,217
and assume
the form of a mighty beast,

855
00:43:13,342 --> 00:43:15,177
and battle your sons to the...

856
00:43:15,302 --> 00:43:18,055
Ooh. Well, how do your boys do
in a crisis?

857
00:43:18,097 --> 00:43:19,937
Not great. One of them
is afraid of everything,

858
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:21,809
and the other
isn't afraid of anything.

859
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:24,770
Yeah, that skinny kid of yours
is pretty fearless.

860
00:43:24,812 --> 00:43:26,605
No, no.
You mean the big one, Barley.

861
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:29,566
No, no, the little guy.
Ooh, he really let me have it.

862
00:43:29,608 --> 00:43:32,152
What? No, look, you said
you could help them, right?

863
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:33,904
Every curse has a core,

864
00:43:34,738 --> 00:43:36,657
the center of its power.

865
00:43:37,616 --> 00:43:38,635
And only one weapon forged of

866
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:40,369
the rarest metals
can destroy it,

867
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:42,454
my enchanted sword,

868
00:43:42,496 --> 00:43:44,456
the Curse Crusher!

869
00:43:45,082 --> 00:43:47,918
Well, okay, but you don't seem
to have that on you.

870
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,920
I sold it.

871
00:43:49,962 --> 00:43:51,880
Got in a little tax trouble
a few years back.

872
00:43:51,922 --> 00:43:54,591
But don't worry,
I know just where to find it.

873
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,343
I am on my way, boys.

874
00:43:56,385 --> 00:43:58,345
Just try to stay
out of trouble.

875
00:44:02,724 --> 00:44:04,893
What is taking you so long?

876
00:44:05,394 --> 00:44:06,834
Who you calling "whimsical"?

877
00:44:07,271 --> 00:44:08,313
Oh, no.

878
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:10,083
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- You've got a lot of nerve.

879
00:44:10,107 --> 00:44:11,149
I'm just saying,

880
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:13,318
sprites used to fly around
spreading delight.

881
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,403
That's a good thing.

882
00:44:14,528 --> 00:44:16,155
Sprites can't fly.

883
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,699
Well, your wings don't work
'cause you stopped using them.

884
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:21,743
- You calling me lazy?
- No, no, no.

885
00:44:21,785 --> 00:44:23,495
Not you. Your ancestors.

886
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:25,998
What did you say
about my ancestors?

887
00:44:26,123 --> 00:44:27,291
I didn't mean lazy...

888
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:28,959
I'm sorry, very sorry.
He's sorry, too.

889
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:30,627
You don't need to fly.
Who needs to fly?

890
00:44:30,669 --> 00:44:31,896
I mean, you've got
those great bikes.

891
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,381
What are you doing?
I was just discussing history.

892
00:44:34,423 --> 00:44:36,675
Barley, I'm trying
to take care of you and Dad,

893
00:44:36,717 --> 00:44:38,176
and you're not making it
any easier.

894
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:39,887
Dad, come on.

895
00:44:40,971 --> 00:44:42,014
Oh, no.

896
00:44:43,724 --> 00:44:46,435
Hey! You're dead!

897
00:44:48,437 --> 00:44:49,980
We're dead! We're dead!
We're dead!

898
00:44:50,022 --> 00:44:52,142
Relax. They won't be
able to lift those bikes.

899
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:54,067
They are strong.

900
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:55,962
We're gonna die! We're
gonna die! We're gonna die!

901
00:44:55,986 --> 00:44:57,029
It's locked.

902
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,113
What? Where are the keys?

903
00:45:01,283 --> 00:45:02,618
I got this.

904
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:04,870
Come on, Barley.

905
00:45:04,912 --> 00:45:06,455
Whoa!

906
00:45:07,915 --> 00:45:09,124
Okay, go, go, go!

907
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:12,794
No. No, no, no. No way.

908
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:13,962
You're gonna have to.

909
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:20,636
Come on.
Why won't it start?

910
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:21,863
There's a sweet spot.

911
00:45:21,887 --> 00:45:23,156
Not in the middle,
not quite at the end.

912
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,514
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

913
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:28,060
Come on, Guinevere!

914
00:45:28,477 --> 00:45:30,729
Put it in "o" for "onward."

915
00:45:36,652 --> 00:45:37,861
Drive!

916
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:43,450
Okay, you're gonna
have to merge.

917
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:46,763
- Speed up!
- I can't do this.

918
00:45:46,787 --> 00:45:48,306
- Yes, you can.
- I'm not ready!

919
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:50,165
You'll never be ready. Merge!

920
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:55,379
Nice job!

921
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:02,886
- Hey, don't hit Gwinny.
- Barley!

922
00:46:06,056 --> 00:46:07,766
- Oh, no.
- Get around 'em!

923
00:46:07,808 --> 00:46:09,285
- They're not letting me in.
- Signal.

924
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:10,519
You don't have a signaler.

925
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,146
Stick your arm straight out
the window to signal left.

926
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,948
- Get back here.
- Just keep driving.

927
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:30,539
Barley!

928
00:46:35,752 --> 00:46:36,813
The mountains are north.

929
00:46:36,837 --> 00:46:38,255
You need to get
all the way over.

930
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:43,093
What the...?

931
00:46:44,386 --> 00:46:46,805
Oh, it is on, Shades!
Get 'em!

932
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:02,988
- Ian, stay focused!
- I can't!

933
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:06,199
You have to focus
or we are all dead!

934
00:47:08,827 --> 00:47:09,870
Just stay cool.

935
00:47:18,587 --> 00:47:20,630
Way to go, Guinevere!

936
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:26,011
Hit it!

937
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,266
We're not gonna make it!

938
00:47:49,409 --> 00:47:50,577
Dad, are you okay?

939
00:47:50,619 --> 00:47:52,829
He's fine,
thanks to the skillful driving

940
00:47:52,871 --> 00:47:55,165
of Sir Ian Lightfoot.
High five!

941
00:47:55,374 --> 00:47:56,625
What is happening?

942
00:47:56,666 --> 00:47:58,668
I think the spell
is wearing off.

943
00:47:59,753 --> 00:48:00,796
Get off my face.

944
00:48:08,095 --> 00:48:10,722
Chantor's Talon! Cops!

945
00:48:10,764 --> 00:48:12,390
- Pull over.
- I don't have a license.

946
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:14,101
My wallet's still tiny.

947
00:48:18,772 --> 00:48:20,732
<i>Step out of the vehicle.</i>

948
00:48:20,857 --> 00:48:22,251
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

949
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:23,902
How are we gonna explain...?
Oh, no. Dad!

950
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:35,956
You have a long night
there, buddy?

951
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:37,100
Sir, I'm gonna ask you

952
00:48:37,124 --> 00:48:38,184
to walk this straight line.

953
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:39,310
They're gonna take Dad.

954
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:40,377
Okay, okay.

955
00:48:40,419 --> 00:48:42,129
Oh, I got it.
The disguise spell.

956
00:48:42,879 --> 00:48:45,549
You can disguise yourself
to be anyone you want.

957
00:48:45,674 --> 00:48:46,800
But what if I mess up again?

958
00:48:46,842 --> 00:48:48,009
According to the spell,

959
00:48:48,051 --> 00:48:49,886
"Disguising yourself
is a lie,

960
00:48:49,928 --> 00:48:51,972
"so you must tell the truth
to get by."

961
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:54,766
As long as you don't tell
a lie, the spell will be fine.

962
00:48:54,891 --> 00:48:57,978
Okay. Who are we gonna be?

963
00:48:58,353 --> 00:49:00,522
Okay, we're taking you down
to the station.

964
00:49:00,564 --> 00:49:03,275
What seems to be the problem

965
00:49:03,316 --> 00:49:06,736
here, fellow police folk?

966
00:49:06,903 --> 00:49:07,988
Officer Bronco?

967
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:09,322
Were you in that van?

968
00:49:09,781 --> 00:49:11,366
Affirmative. And we will...

969
00:49:11,408 --> 00:49:13,535
I mean, I will take
full responsibility

970
00:49:13,577 --> 00:49:14,911
for that fella right there,

971
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:17,080
so you can just release him
over to me.

972
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:18,832
Hey, I wanted to be the front.

973
00:49:18,874 --> 00:49:20,292
No way. I'll do the talking.

974
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:21,602
Bronco, I thought
you were working

975
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:22,878
on the other side of town.

976
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:24,546
I, uh, changed my mind.

977
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:27,215
Something wrong?

978
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,259
Just a little neck cramp.

979
00:49:30,844 --> 00:49:32,971
You have to stop lying.

980
00:49:33,013 --> 00:49:34,848
Answer every question
with a question.

981
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:36,808
What exactly
are you doing out here?

982
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:38,894
Uh... What am I doing
out here?

983
00:49:39,186 --> 00:49:41,438
What are any of us doing
out here?

984
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:44,858
Whoa. I never thought about it
like that.

985
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:46,067
Nice.

986
00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:48,487
With all due respect,
you didn't answer my question.

987
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:50,864
Well,
we were just exercising

988
00:49:50,989 --> 00:49:54,826
some driver's education drills
for Ian.

989
00:49:55,994 --> 00:49:57,579
Who is Ian?

990
00:49:57,704 --> 00:49:59,873
Oh, is that Laurel's kid?

991
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:02,501
Ian is Laurel's kid.

992
00:50:03,084 --> 00:50:05,462
Your stepson was swerving
all over the road.

993
00:50:05,587 --> 00:50:06,838
Yeah, well...

994
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,882
that guy's
not all there today.

995
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:11,801
Yeah, he does seem
a little off.

996
00:50:13,261 --> 00:50:15,764
You seem
a little off yourself.

997
00:50:15,972 --> 00:50:19,684
Uh, actually, if I'm being
completely honest,

998
00:50:19,726 --> 00:50:20,852
I'm not super great

999
00:50:21,394 --> 00:50:22,604
in this kind of situation,

1000
00:50:22,646 --> 00:50:24,648
and I'm starting to freak out
a little bit.

1001
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:28,109
And I'm all sweaty and weird,
and I don't know what to say

1002
00:50:28,151 --> 00:50:30,403
and I just feel like
I can't do anything right,

1003
00:50:30,445 --> 00:50:32,030
and I'm a total weirdo.

1004
00:50:32,072 --> 00:50:34,115
Hold on, hold on.

1005
00:50:34,658 --> 00:50:37,035
I think I know
what's going on here.

1006
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,537
Uh... You do?

1007
00:50:38,912 --> 00:50:41,039
It's not easy
being a new parent.

1008
00:50:41,164 --> 00:50:43,583
My girlfriend's daughter got
me pulling my hair out, okay?

1009
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:45,418
Oh. Oh, yeah.

1010
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:47,462
All right, we can let him go.

1011
00:50:47,504 --> 00:50:51,466
Okay, well, I'm just gonna
take him to the van.

1012
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:54,344
Hey, it gets better.
All right? Good luck, Bronco.

1013
00:50:54,386 --> 00:50:55,887
You, too, Officer.

1014
00:50:56,054 --> 00:50:58,723
Keep workin' hard
or hardly workin'.

1015
00:51:00,058 --> 00:51:01,935
Now, that was a good Colt.

1016
00:51:02,644 --> 00:51:04,312
I don't envy you, Bronco.

1017
00:51:04,354 --> 00:51:06,189
That Lightfoot kid
is a handful.

1018
00:51:06,606 --> 00:51:09,359
Uh, I'm gonna have to disagree
with you there.

1019
00:51:09,401 --> 00:51:12,362
I think Ian's
a pretty stand-up citizen.

1020
00:51:12,404 --> 00:51:15,073
Not him, the older one.

1021
00:51:15,115 --> 00:51:16,157
What?

1022
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:18,577
I mean, the guy's a screwup.

1023
00:51:18,952 --> 00:51:20,328
You can't say you don't agree.

1024
00:51:20,704 --> 00:51:22,247
Um, I don't.

1025
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:25,750
What?

1026
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,920
I mean, okay, well...

1027
00:51:28,962 --> 00:51:31,089
I gotta get going.
Gotta get Ian home.

1028
00:51:32,799 --> 00:51:34,235
I mean, I'm late for work.

1029
00:51:34,259 --> 00:51:35,969
Sorry, I mean,
I'm feelin' a little sick.

1030
00:51:36,011 --> 00:51:38,013
I mean tired. Sick and tired.
Gotta go!

1031
00:51:38,054 --> 00:51:39,306
See you Monday!

1032
00:51:43,435 --> 00:51:46,479
Oh, man.
Bronco is losin' it.

1033
00:51:46,605 --> 00:51:48,481
See, that's why
I never got married.

1034
00:51:48,523 --> 00:51:50,567
Old Gore can't be tied down.

1035
00:51:56,156 --> 00:51:57,866
This is Specter.

1036
00:51:57,907 --> 00:52:01,077
Can you put me through
to Officer Colt Bronco?

1037
00:52:11,463 --> 00:52:14,549
Barley, I don't know
what happened back there.

1038
00:52:14,841 --> 00:52:17,010
But I don't think
you're a screwup.

1039
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:22,474
Maybe the magic
just got it wrong, you know.

1040
00:52:23,516 --> 00:52:24,559
Yeah.

1041
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,397
I don't know what happened.

1042
00:52:29,439 --> 00:52:31,399
Barley! Barley!

1043
00:52:38,281 --> 00:52:39,824
Where are you going?

1044
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,411
Barley, come on.
This is all just...

1045
00:52:43,453 --> 00:52:44,621
I'm not a screwup.

1046
00:52:44,746 --> 00:52:46,039
I didn't say you were.

1047
00:52:46,081 --> 00:52:47,707
The magic said it for you.

1048
00:52:47,749 --> 00:52:49,459
Well, the magic got it wrong.

1049
00:52:49,501 --> 00:52:50,960
Magic doesn't get it wrong!

1050
00:52:51,086 --> 00:52:52,170
The cop asked a question,

1051
00:52:52,212 --> 00:52:54,964
you answered, and magic
revealed the truth. Right?

1052
00:52:55,173 --> 00:52:56,216
Right?

1053
00:52:56,257 --> 00:52:58,176
I don't know how
any of this stuff works.

1054
00:52:58,301 --> 00:53:00,011
All I know is that everything

1055
00:53:00,053 --> 00:53:01,846
we've done tonight
has gone wrong.

1056
00:53:01,888 --> 00:53:03,491
Yeah, it's gone wrong because
you won't listen to me.

1057
00:53:03,515 --> 00:53:04,557
Are you kidding?

1058
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:06,452
Because everything we've done
has been your idea.

1059
00:53:06,476 --> 00:53:07,727
But you didn't do it my way.

1060
00:53:07,811 --> 00:53:09,396
You didn't let me
handle the Manticore.

1061
00:53:09,437 --> 00:53:11,123
You freaked out
when I talked to the sprites.

1062
00:53:11,147 --> 00:53:12,500
'Cause you don't think
I have good ideas.

1063
00:53:12,524 --> 00:53:13,942
What? Of course I do.

1064
00:53:13,983 --> 00:53:16,486
Great! Then I think we should
take the Path of Peril.

1065
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:19,531
And I also think that
would be good, normally...

1066
00:53:19,572 --> 00:53:20,615
See?

1067
00:53:20,657 --> 00:53:22,242
But, I told you,
this isn't a game.

1068
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:23,993
All that matters today
is Dad,

1069
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:26,246
and right now
he's sitting in that van,

1070
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:27,455
and he's confused...

1071
00:53:27,622 --> 00:53:28,665
What?

1072
00:53:32,377 --> 00:53:33,878
What is he doing?

1073
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,297
I think he can feel
the vibrations of the music,

1074
00:53:36,339 --> 00:53:38,800
and he's dancing.

1075
00:53:42,429 --> 00:53:43,513
Wow.

1076
00:53:44,139 --> 00:53:46,433
He is terrible.

1077
00:53:51,938 --> 00:53:54,482
Yeah.
He's really, really bad.

1078
00:53:55,442 --> 00:53:57,026
Oh, no.
Here he comes.

1079
00:53:57,068 --> 00:53:58,903
No, no, no. Thanks, Dad.
Dad, thank you.

1080
00:53:59,154 --> 00:54:00,196
I'm good.

1081
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:01,364
Stop.

1082
00:54:01,406 --> 00:54:03,158
Okay. Okay.

1083
00:54:03,783 --> 00:54:05,285
No, no, no!

1084
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:07,078
I'm not really a big dancer.

1085
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,413
Uh...

1086
00:54:11,124 --> 00:54:13,710
Just imagine what the top half
of this dance looks like.

1087
00:54:13,877 --> 00:54:16,004
I bet it goes
something like this.

1088
00:54:25,263 --> 00:54:26,347
Ow.

1089
00:54:26,556 --> 00:54:28,850
Ah, you danced your shoelaces
loose there, Pop.

1090
00:54:32,771 --> 00:54:35,565
You know,
I wanna see him, too.

1091
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:38,943
Yeah, I know.

1092
00:54:39,444 --> 00:54:41,279
It's not fair for you
to call me a screwup

1093
00:54:41,321 --> 00:54:44,157
if you don't give me a chance
to get something right.

1094
00:54:44,866 --> 00:54:46,826
Just do one thing my way.

1095
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:50,789
You really think
this Path of Peril

1096
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:52,707
is the best way
to go to the mountain?

1097
00:54:56,628 --> 00:54:57,879
Okay.

1098
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:15,480
Uh... So, where is
your magic sword?

1099
00:55:15,563 --> 00:55:17,690
It lies beyond those gates.

1100
00:55:19,442 --> 00:55:21,361
If we don't leave here
with the sword,

1101
00:55:21,778 --> 00:55:23,196
your boys are doomed.

1102
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:25,073
There you are.

1103
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:26,699
One garlic crusher.

1104
00:55:26,825 --> 00:55:28,368
No, Curse Crusher.

1105
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:30,245
It's a large magical sword.

1106
00:55:30,703 --> 00:55:31,704
Sword.

1107
00:55:31,746 --> 00:55:34,040
Sword, sword, sword.

1108
00:55:34,082 --> 00:55:35,708
I mean, I got this thing.

1109
00:55:36,918 --> 00:55:38,294
- That's it!
- How much?

1110
00:55:39,546 --> 00:55:42,048
- Let's call it, uh, 10.
- Great!

1111
00:55:42,173 --> 00:55:44,008
Forged of the rarest metals,

1112
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:46,344
the only sword of its kind
in all the land.

1113
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:50,682
Hello, old friend.
We shall never part again.

1114
00:55:50,974 --> 00:55:53,184
Oh! Turns out this sword

1115
00:55:53,226 --> 00:55:56,187
is the only sword of its kind
in all the land.

1116
00:55:56,354 --> 00:56:00,066
So, let's call it 10,000.

1117
00:56:00,275 --> 00:56:03,611
- You can't do that!
- Well, I just did.

1118
00:56:03,653 --> 00:56:05,280
Okay, you had better...

1119
00:56:05,321 --> 00:56:07,240
Yeah?

1120
00:56:07,282 --> 00:56:09,075
Hey, I talked
to some other officers,

1121
00:56:09,117 --> 00:56:11,119
and they said the boys
were last seen going north.

1122
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,829
- Are they okay?
<i>- They're fine.</i>

1123
00:56:12,871 --> 00:56:15,206
But the officers said...
Well, honey,

1124
00:56:15,248 --> 00:56:17,584
<i>this night keeps getting
stranger and stranger.</i>

1125
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:19,419
Do you know who I am?

1126
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,629
Some kind of
winged bear-snake lady?

1127
00:56:21,671 --> 00:56:23,756
Argh!
Winged lion-scorpion lady!

1128
00:56:23,798 --> 00:56:25,133
It sure does.

1129
00:56:25,258 --> 00:56:26,843
Listen, I need that sword.

1130
00:56:26,885 --> 00:56:28,636
My sons have
a once-in-a-lifetime chance

1131
00:56:28,678 --> 00:56:29,721
to see their father.

1132
00:56:29,762 --> 00:56:30,805
Now, my oldest son...

1133
00:56:32,557 --> 00:56:34,809
Holy son of a...
You killed her!

1134
00:56:34,851 --> 00:56:37,353
It's okay. She's only
temporarily paralyzed.

1135
00:56:37,478 --> 00:56:38,980
Hey, you can't do this.

1136
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:40,898
- Well, I just did.
- Grab the sword.

1137
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,066
Don't you touch that.

1138
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:43,151
Here you go.

1139
00:56:43,192 --> 00:56:44,837
And a little something extra
for your trouble.

1140
00:56:44,861 --> 00:56:45,945
I love your store.

1141
00:56:45,987 --> 00:56:47,447
Oh, that's so pretty.

1142
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:49,741
Hey! Hey!

1143
00:56:49,824 --> 00:56:51,534
Yeah!

1144
00:56:51,576 --> 00:56:53,036
Laurel, what's happening?

1145
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:54,597
- Yeah!
<i>- Hello? Are you all right?</i>

1146
00:56:54,621 --> 00:56:55,663
<i>Laurel?</i>

1147
00:56:55,705 --> 00:56:58,082
Oh, Colt, I can't talk.
The boys need me.

1148
00:56:58,166 --> 00:56:59,792
Wait!

1149
00:57:00,001 --> 00:57:01,628
Dang those kids.

1150
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:07,133
Huh.

1151
00:57:33,952 --> 00:57:35,745
<i>♪ We're heading on a quest</i>

1152
00:57:35,787 --> 00:57:37,330
<i>♪ Our father we must retrieve</i>

1153
00:57:37,455 --> 00:57:39,624
<i>♪ The Lightfoot brothers
can't be stopped</i>

1154
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:41,084
<i>♪ Something, something</i>

1155
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:42,919
<i>♪ That rhymes with retrieve ♪</i>

1156
00:57:47,507 --> 00:57:49,300
Yeah, we're still here.

1157
00:57:49,842 --> 00:57:53,054
Well, good morning to thee,
dear Lightfoot men.

1158
00:57:53,096 --> 00:57:55,723
Welcome to the Path of Peril.

1159
00:57:56,057 --> 00:57:58,434
It's not much of a path.

1160
00:57:58,476 --> 00:58:01,020
Well, you know, they never
really developed around here.

1161
00:58:01,062 --> 00:58:02,939
So, heads up,
we could run into anything.

1162
00:58:02,981 --> 00:58:05,942
A centicore, wolf dragon,
gelatinous cube.

1163
00:58:06,067 --> 00:58:08,528
Okay, what is
a gelatinous cube?

1164
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:10,488
Oh, it's a giant green cube

1165
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:13,241
that instantly disintegrates
all that it touches.

1166
00:58:13,408 --> 00:58:15,243
We are not gonna run into a...
Oh! Stop!

1167
00:58:15,284 --> 00:58:16,786
Ahh!

1168
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:27,213
What is this?

1169
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,756
Bottomless pit.

1170
00:58:29,382 --> 00:58:32,552
Whatever falls in there,
falls forever.

1171
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:37,473
Aw, Dad, come here.

1172
00:58:37,765 --> 00:58:38,850
Ian, check it out.

1173
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:42,228
This is an ancient drawbridge.

1174
00:58:42,353 --> 00:58:43,646
We lower that bad boy

1175
00:58:43,688 --> 00:58:46,190
and we are on our way
to Raven's Point.

1176
00:58:47,275 --> 00:58:49,318
Look around for a lever.

1177
00:58:51,112 --> 00:58:52,238
Found it.

1178
00:58:52,363 --> 00:58:54,866
But it's on the other side.

1179
00:58:55,742 --> 00:58:57,994
Okay, I got this.

1180
00:58:58,494 --> 00:59:00,038
<i>Aloft Elevar.</i>

1181
00:59:04,542 --> 00:59:06,043
You can't cast
a levitation spell

1182
00:59:06,085 --> 00:59:07,146
on something that far away.

1183
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:09,714
It only has, like, a 15-meter
enchanting radius.

1184
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:11,632
Dad, can you believe this guy?

1185
00:59:12,925 --> 00:59:15,344
What we need
is a Trust Bridge.

1186
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:17,638
It's a spell that creates
a magical bridge

1187
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,973
you can walk on.

1188
00:59:19,098 --> 00:59:22,226
Just say <i>"Bridgrigar Invisia."</i>

1189
00:59:22,351 --> 00:59:24,479
Okay<i>. Bridgrigar Invisia.</i>

1190
00:59:24,604 --> 00:59:26,814
<i>Bridgrigar Invisia!</i>

1191
00:59:29,901 --> 00:59:32,070
- It didn't work.
- No, the spell's still going.

1192
00:59:32,195 --> 00:59:34,530
You won't know if your bridge
worked until you step on it.

1193
00:59:34,572 --> 00:59:35,656
Step on what?

1194
00:59:35,698 --> 00:59:37,825
If you believe the bridge
is there, then it's there.

1195
00:59:37,867 --> 00:59:39,911
- But it's not.
- Well, not with that attitude.

1196
00:59:39,952 --> 00:59:42,079
I'm not gonna step out
onto nothing.

1197
00:59:45,124 --> 00:59:46,751
Now we've got a rope.

1198
00:59:46,793 --> 00:59:48,270
But you're not gonna
even need it because...

1199
00:59:48,294 --> 00:59:49,545
- I want the rope!
- Okay.

1200
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:51,315
I'm just saying you're not
gonna need the rope,

1201
00:59:51,339 --> 00:59:53,424
because I know
you can make that bridge.

1202
01:00:04,185 --> 01:00:06,354
I'm dying! I'm dying!
I'm dead! I'm dead! I'm dead!

1203
01:00:06,395 --> 01:00:08,022
- Oh, my life is over.
- I got you.

1204
01:00:11,526 --> 01:00:12,777
Okay, you fell.

1205
01:00:12,819 --> 01:00:14,487
- But was that so bad?
- Yes!

1206
01:00:14,529 --> 01:00:17,448
- Are you still alive?
- Yes.

1207
01:00:17,573 --> 01:00:20,326
Okay, so now you know
the worst that can happen.

1208
01:00:20,451 --> 01:00:22,829
So, there's nothing
to be scared of, right?

1209
01:00:26,749 --> 01:00:29,377
<i>Bridgrigar Invisia!</i>

1210
01:00:32,547 --> 01:00:36,259
Hey. You can do this.

1211
01:00:44,934 --> 01:00:46,561
- Yeah!
- There you go!

1212
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:51,315
Believe with every step.

1213
01:00:54,026 --> 01:00:55,820
Oh, yeah!

1214
01:00:59,448 --> 01:01:00,575
You've got me, right?

1215
01:01:00,616 --> 01:01:01,659
I still got you.

1216
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:06,414
Ian Lightfoot is fearless.

1217
01:01:10,376 --> 01:01:12,753
This is amazing!

1218
01:01:15,423 --> 01:01:17,091
Yeah! But just keep going.

1219
01:01:17,133 --> 01:01:20,011
Don't look back.
Just straight ahead.

1220
01:01:21,804 --> 01:01:23,723
You've still got the rope,
right?

1221
01:01:23,848 --> 01:01:25,349
Yeah, I got it.

1222
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:28,269
I am not afraid!

1223
01:01:28,311 --> 01:01:31,188
Oh, man,
I could stay out here all day.

1224
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:32,440
Huh. Huh.

1225
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:35,318
Okay, but keep moving.
We've gotta see Dad, remember?

1226
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:38,988
Hey, Dad,
this last step is for you.

1227
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:42,366
Ahh!

1228
01:01:47,622 --> 01:01:49,123
Oh.

1229
01:01:56,547 --> 01:01:58,341
He did it, Dad.

1230
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:08,392
That was amazing.

1231
01:02:08,517 --> 01:02:11,103
How long was the rope gone?

1232
01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:13,898
Oh, just, like,
the second half of it.

1233
01:02:14,482 --> 01:02:16,609
I needed that rope.

1234
01:02:16,651 --> 01:02:18,903
Oh, but did you?

1235
01:02:24,617 --> 01:02:26,953
Ian! Look.

1236
01:02:28,454 --> 01:02:29,956
It's a raven.

1237
01:02:31,123 --> 01:02:33,960
The clue on the menu said
Raven's Point.

1238
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:36,754
Yeah. In the mountains.

1239
01:02:37,672 --> 01:02:39,799
But maybe the puzzle
didn't mean the mountain.

1240
01:02:40,174 --> 01:02:42,885
Maybe it means follow
where the raven is pointing.

1241
01:02:46,764 --> 01:02:48,516
It's another raven.

1242
01:02:49,392 --> 01:02:51,560
That one could be
pointing to another raven,

1243
01:02:51,602 --> 01:02:52,979
all the way to the gem.

1244
01:02:53,521 --> 01:02:55,815
I... I had us going
the wrong way.

1245
01:02:55,982 --> 01:02:58,234
Well, I told you.
My gut knows where to go.

1246
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:00,111
Don't you, boy? Yes, you do.

1247
01:03:01,529 --> 01:03:03,030
- Huh.
- Come on, Dad.

1248
01:03:03,072 --> 01:03:05,199
Guinevere will get us
to that raven in no time.

1249
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,666
You guys...

1250
01:03:14,375 --> 01:03:16,085
...are in trouble, big time.

1251
01:03:16,127 --> 01:03:17,712
No, no, no, Colt.
We found a spell.

1252
01:03:17,753 --> 01:03:20,548
If we finish it before sunset,
we'll get to see our father.

1253
01:03:20,589 --> 01:03:21,799
Ahh!

1254
01:03:22,258 --> 01:03:23,968
Well, uh, your mom told me

1255
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:26,470
there was some kind
of strange

1256
01:03:26,512 --> 01:03:28,014
family issue going on,

1257
01:03:28,055 --> 01:03:30,808
and this is
definitely strange.

1258
01:03:30,933 --> 01:03:32,018
But no, dang it.

1259
01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:33,978
I'm not letting you
upset your mother anymore.

1260
01:03:34,103 --> 01:03:36,313
Now you get in the vehicle,
I'm escorting you home.

1261
01:03:36,355 --> 01:03:37,481
No. No way.

1262
01:03:37,606 --> 01:03:39,400
I'm giving you
to the count of three.

1263
01:03:41,569 --> 01:03:43,738
- Okay, we'll go.
- Ian.

1264
01:03:43,863 --> 01:03:45,990
He's a police officer.

1265
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:54,081
What are you doing?

1266
01:03:54,206 --> 01:03:55,666
I don't know.

1267
01:03:56,876 --> 01:03:58,377
Son of a...

1268
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:02,757
I need backup. Runaway van!

1269
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:07,345
Yeah! Iandore Lightfoot,
breaking the rules.

1270
01:04:07,386 --> 01:04:09,055
I can't believe
I'm running from the cops.

1271
01:04:09,096 --> 01:04:10,407
You're not running
from the cops,

1272
01:04:10,431 --> 01:04:12,683
you're running from
our mom's boyfriend.

1273
01:04:13,934 --> 01:04:15,895
Okay, now you're running
from the cops.

1274
01:04:27,448 --> 01:04:28,491
Hold on!

1275
01:04:29,158 --> 01:04:31,077
Whoa!

1276
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:36,957
Yeah! Nice going, Guinevere!

1277
01:04:53,015 --> 01:04:55,142
Oh, what did I do?
I shouldn't have driven away.

1278
01:04:55,184 --> 01:04:56,811
No, it was great.

1279
01:04:56,936 --> 01:04:58,413
Hey, block the road
with those boulders.

1280
01:04:58,437 --> 01:04:59,855
What? How?

1281
01:05:00,106 --> 01:05:01,148
Arcane Lightning.

1282
01:05:01,649 --> 01:05:02,876
You said
that's the hardest spell.

1283
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,068
You are ready.

1284
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:05,736
"To make lightning
strike with ease,

1285
01:05:05,778 --> 01:05:07,279
"one must follow all decrees."

1286
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:08,405
You have to do everything.

1287
01:05:08,531 --> 01:05:09,633
Speak from your heart's fire,

1288
01:05:09,657 --> 01:05:12,034
trust yourself, focus,
all of it.

1289
01:05:14,078 --> 01:05:16,622
<i>Voltar Thundasir.</i>

1290
01:05:17,623 --> 01:05:19,250
<i>Voltar Thundasir.</i>

1291
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:21,127
<i>Voltar Thundasir!</i>

1292
01:05:28,008 --> 01:05:30,594
I can't! I can't do it.

1293
01:05:32,179 --> 01:05:36,392
We're not gonna see you, Dad.
And it's all my fault.

1294
01:05:55,995 --> 01:05:57,163
What are you doing?

1295
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:44,293
What the...?

1296
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,762
Barley.

1297
01:06:55,179 --> 01:06:57,723
She was just
a beat-up old van.

1298
01:06:59,016 --> 01:07:00,935
Come on, we gotta go.

1299
01:08:04,832 --> 01:08:05,874
Wait.

1300
01:08:20,848 --> 01:08:22,600
Oh. You see that, Dad?

1301
01:08:22,641 --> 01:08:25,561
The apprentice has become
the master.

1302
01:08:27,646 --> 01:08:29,189
It looks like water.

1303
01:08:34,153 --> 01:08:36,196
So, what's the, uh,
X mean?

1304
01:08:36,322 --> 01:08:38,949
On a quest,
an X only means one thing.

1305
01:08:39,658 --> 01:08:42,995
We go to the end of the water,
we'll find that Phoenix Gem.

1306
01:08:55,382 --> 01:08:56,508
Unicorns!

1307
01:09:15,194 --> 01:09:16,612
Whoa.

1308
01:09:18,906 --> 01:09:20,491
Cool.

1309
01:09:23,744 --> 01:09:26,622
This water
could go on for miles.

1310
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:28,207
We don't have that kinda time.

1311
01:09:28,957 --> 01:09:30,918
If we had something
to float on,

1312
01:09:30,959 --> 01:09:32,920
we could cast
a velocity spell on it,

1313
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:34,880
fly down the tunnel
like a magic jet ski.

1314
01:09:34,963 --> 01:09:37,257
Well, there's not much
to float on.

1315
01:09:37,383 --> 01:09:39,051
Remember, on a quest,

1316
01:09:39,093 --> 01:09:41,679
you have to use
what you've got.

1317
01:09:43,555 --> 01:09:45,808
<i>Magnora Gantuan!</i>

1318
01:09:47,768 --> 01:09:49,311
Woo-hoo!

1319
01:09:50,396 --> 01:09:51,939
<i>Accelior!</i>

1320
01:09:53,148 --> 01:09:54,525
Whoa!

1321
01:09:54,566 --> 01:09:56,860
This is actually kinda cool.

1322
01:09:56,985 --> 01:09:59,822
So, what other spells
do you know?

1323
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:02,157
Brace yourself,
young mage.

1324
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:05,035
I know all there is
to know of magic.

1325
01:10:08,205 --> 01:10:09,724
Colt, we know
where the boys are going.

1326
01:10:09,748 --> 01:10:12,084
We just have to get to them
before they unleash the curse.

1327
01:10:12,126 --> 01:10:14,628
- <i>The what?</i>
- Let's crush some curses!

1328
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:16,189
The curse. The curse
that protects the gem

1329
01:10:16,213 --> 01:10:17,691
by turning into
a rock dragon or something.

1330
01:10:17,715 --> 01:10:18,757
<i>A what dragon?</i>

1331
01:10:18,799 --> 01:10:19,842
I can't explain it.

1332
01:10:19,883 --> 01:10:21,844
I just know we have
to get to the boys fast.

1333
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:24,179
Oh, we'll get to them fast.
We'll get to them so fast.

1334
01:10:24,805 --> 01:10:25,848
Oh!

1335
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:29,101
Well, I almost had 'em,
but Ian, he just drove off.

1336
01:10:29,143 --> 01:10:30,853
- Huh. Good for him.
<i>- What?</i>

1337
01:10:30,894 --> 01:10:32,771
No, I just mean
he's scared to drive.

1338
01:10:32,813 --> 01:10:34,707
Thinks something's gonna
come at him out of the...

1339
01:10:45,367 --> 01:10:46,952
Oh! I think I stung my leg.

1340
01:10:47,077 --> 01:10:49,121
<i>Laurel, what happened?
What's goin' on?</i>

1341
01:10:49,163 --> 01:10:50,664
You almost killed me, lady.

1342
01:10:50,706 --> 01:10:52,624
Are you okay?
Where did you come from?

1343
01:10:52,666 --> 01:10:54,001
You were in our flight path.

1344
01:10:55,294 --> 01:10:57,129
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

1345
01:10:57,171 --> 01:10:58,797
Oh, no. Our transport!

1346
01:10:58,839 --> 01:11:00,924
How are we going
to get to your sons now?

1347
01:11:00,966 --> 01:11:03,969
Come on, Pixie Dusters,
let's take to the skies.

1348
01:11:04,011 --> 01:11:06,096
- Yeah!
- I was born to fly!

1349
01:11:07,347 --> 01:11:10,100
How do you feel
about exercising those wings?

1350
01:11:10,976 --> 01:11:12,019
Uh...

1351
01:11:14,605 --> 01:11:16,023
<i>Boombastia!</i>

1352
01:11:16,064 --> 01:11:18,400
- Ah, remember...
- Oh, right.

1353
01:11:18,901 --> 01:11:20,277
<i>Boombastia!</i>

1354
01:11:21,487 --> 01:11:22,654
Whoa!

1355
01:11:22,696 --> 01:11:25,324
Yeah! You're a natural!
Think fast.

1356
01:11:25,365 --> 01:11:26,658
<i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

1357
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,869
Yeah! Nice!

1358
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,764
Careful how much boat
you're eating there, man,

1359
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:33,641
we still gotta make it
to the end of the tunnel.

1360
01:11:33,665 --> 01:11:35,167
Yeah. Good point.

1361
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:41,089
I can't believe
I'm this close

1362
01:11:41,131 --> 01:11:42,883
to actually talking to Dad.

1363
01:11:43,008 --> 01:11:44,110
You know what
I'm gonna ask him?

1364
01:11:44,134 --> 01:11:45,570
If he ever gave himself
a wizard name.

1365
01:11:45,594 --> 01:11:46,637
What?

1366
01:11:46,678 --> 01:11:47,739
Well, 'cause he was
into magic.

1367
01:11:47,763 --> 01:11:49,139
Lots of wizards
have cool names.

1368
01:11:49,181 --> 01:11:50,766
Alora the Majestic.

1369
01:11:50,891 --> 01:11:53,310
Birdar the Fanciful.

1370
01:11:53,352 --> 01:11:54,895
Anyway, it'll just be nice

1371
01:11:54,937 --> 01:11:56,897
to have more than
four memories of him.

1372
01:11:56,939 --> 01:11:58,357
- Uh, three.
- Hmm?

1373
01:11:58,398 --> 01:11:59,858
You only have three memories.

1374
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,109
Oh, yeah.

1375
01:12:01,235 --> 01:12:02,569
Barley, do you have

1376
01:12:02,611 --> 01:12:04,279
another memory of Dad
you haven't told me?

1377
01:12:04,571 --> 01:12:07,908
No, it's just not my favorite.

1378
01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:09,201
What do you mean?

1379
01:12:11,537 --> 01:12:14,039
When Dad was sick,

1380
01:12:14,623 --> 01:12:19,461
I was supposed to go in
and say goodbye to him.

1381
01:12:20,587 --> 01:12:23,799
But he was hooked up
to all these tubes,

1382
01:12:25,342 --> 01:12:28,095
and he just
didn't look like himself.

1383
01:12:29,179 --> 01:12:31,181
I got scared,

1384
01:12:32,307 --> 01:12:34,351
and I didn't go in.

1385
01:12:37,521 --> 01:12:38,730
That's when I decided

1386
01:12:38,772 --> 01:12:41,733
I was never gonna be
scared ever again.

1387
01:12:46,655 --> 01:12:49,241
Oh. Looks like
we're coming up on somethin'.

1388
01:12:59,251 --> 01:13:00,836
The final gauntlet.

1389
01:13:13,515 --> 01:13:16,101
The Phoenix Gem
is just on the other side.

1390
01:13:19,146 --> 01:13:22,107
Careful, there could be
booby traps.

1391
01:13:22,149 --> 01:13:24,109
This place is, like,
1,000 years old.

1392
01:13:24,151 --> 01:13:25,485
There's no way
there could be...

1393
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,535
Oh, no.

1394
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:36,121
It can't be.

1395
01:13:37,956 --> 01:13:39,833
A gelatinous cube!

1396
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:47,382
Run!

1397
01:13:47,424 --> 01:13:48,610
Whoa! Wait!
It's some kind of puzzle.

1398
01:13:48,634 --> 01:13:49,819
We gotta figure it out
before...

1399
01:13:49,843 --> 01:13:51,345
No time. Grab a shield.

1400
01:14:03,774 --> 01:14:05,734
- Jump! Trust me!
- What?

1401
01:14:07,819 --> 01:14:08,987
<i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

1402
01:14:12,282 --> 01:14:13,325
Ow.

1403
01:14:15,077 --> 01:14:16,119
Ian.

1404
01:14:26,296 --> 01:14:27,381
Whew!

1405
01:14:27,756 --> 01:14:29,841
Don't step on that.

1406
01:14:32,594 --> 01:14:34,721
I didn't touch it.

1407
01:14:38,684 --> 01:14:39,851
<i>Voltar Thundasir!</i>

1408
01:14:47,693 --> 01:14:50,028
The tile down there has
the same shape as the opening.

1409
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:51,571
Maybe we were supposed
to step on it?

1410
01:14:51,613 --> 01:14:52,656
- What?
- I got it.

1411
01:14:52,698 --> 01:14:53,740
No, Barley!

1412
01:15:01,123 --> 01:15:02,332
Oh! It's working!

1413
01:15:05,502 --> 01:15:07,546
It's impossible.

1414
01:15:08,463 --> 01:15:11,007
No one can hold
their breath that long.

1415
01:15:44,416 --> 01:15:45,751
We made it!

1416
01:15:45,792 --> 01:15:47,043
Oh.

1417
01:15:47,085 --> 01:15:49,796
The Phoenix Gem
awaits beyond this door.

1418
01:15:49,838 --> 01:15:51,047
Shall we?

1419
01:15:51,131 --> 01:15:52,841
We certainly shall!

1420
01:15:52,966 --> 01:15:54,801
Dad, we have followed
the quest,

1421
01:15:54,843 --> 01:15:57,846
and it has led us
to our victory!

1422
01:16:16,907 --> 01:16:18,575
We're back home.

1423
01:16:18,617 --> 01:16:21,620
No, that doesn't make sense.
We took the Path of Peril.

1424
01:16:21,661 --> 01:16:22,746
We followed the ravens,

1425
01:16:22,788 --> 01:16:24,164
we went to the end
of the water...

1426
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:27,292
Unless the X meant
stay away from the water.

1427
01:16:27,334 --> 01:16:28,919
Or it could be,
like, a campfire?

1428
01:16:29,586 --> 01:16:30,855
It's okay.
We can figure this out.

1429
01:16:30,879 --> 01:16:33,340
Figure out what?
We're back where we started.

1430
01:16:33,465 --> 01:16:35,109
I mean, it has to be here.
There was a gauntlet.

1431
01:16:35,133 --> 01:16:36,843
I mean,
unless that gauntlet was for,

1432
01:16:36,885 --> 01:16:38,595
coincidentally,
some different quest.

1433
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:39,971
- That's a possibility.
- What?

1434
01:16:40,013 --> 01:16:42,599
No, no, no. This has to be
where the Phoenix Gem is.

1435
01:16:43,558 --> 01:16:44,726
I followed my gut.

1436
01:16:45,519 --> 01:16:47,854
- Oh, no.
- What?

1437
01:16:48,313 --> 01:16:50,315
The gem is in the mountain.

1438
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,234
The mountain
we could have been to

1439
01:16:52,275 --> 01:16:54,236
hours ago if we just...

1440
01:16:54,277 --> 01:16:55,946
If we just stayed
on the expressway.

1441
01:16:55,987 --> 01:16:57,739
No, the expressway
is too obvious.

1442
01:16:57,781 --> 01:16:58,925
You can never take
the obvious...

1443
01:16:58,949 --> 01:17:01,284
If I hadn't listened to you!
Okay?

1444
01:17:01,409 --> 01:17:02,828
I can't believe this.

1445
01:17:02,953 --> 01:17:05,288
You act like you know
what you're doing,

1446
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:06,748
but you don't have a clue,

1447
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:09,584
and that's because
you are a screwup.

1448
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:11,378
And now you've screwed up
my chance

1449
01:17:11,419 --> 01:17:13,213
to have the one thing
I never had!

1450
01:17:19,761 --> 01:17:20,846
Where are you going?

1451
01:17:20,971 --> 01:17:23,515
To spend what little time
we have left with Dad.

1452
01:17:24,808 --> 01:17:26,309
Ian, wait!

1453
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:29,604
We can still find
the Phoenix Gem.

1454
01:17:29,729 --> 01:17:31,815
We just have to keep lookin'.

1455
01:17:32,649 --> 01:17:34,150
Ian!

1456
01:17:34,693 --> 01:17:36,069
Ian!

1457
01:17:47,622 --> 01:17:48,790
No, Dad.

1458
01:17:48,915 --> 01:17:50,125
He's not here.

1459
01:18:01,928 --> 01:18:04,431
Come on. Where is it?

1460
01:18:05,223 --> 01:18:06,516
Follow the water.

1461
01:18:13,356 --> 01:18:14,399
Ugh...

1462
01:18:14,441 --> 01:18:16,067
All right. Come on,
out of the fountain.

1463
01:18:16,484 --> 01:18:18,528
No, I'm looking
for an ancient gem.

1464
01:18:18,695 --> 01:18:20,614
Oh, yeah, we know.
"The old days."

1465
01:18:20,655 --> 01:18:22,407
No! Stop! Please! No!

1466
01:18:22,449 --> 01:18:23,742
Okay, ow, okay!

1467
01:18:23,783 --> 01:18:25,827
Okay. I'm leaving.

1468
01:18:26,536 --> 01:18:27,913
- Hey!
- Come on!

1469
01:18:28,705 --> 01:18:31,875
Can someone call the cops?
We got the history buff again.

1470
01:18:59,486 --> 01:19:01,196
<i>- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.</i>

1471
01:19:01,238 --> 01:19:03,865
- I'm not ready!
- You'll never be ready. Merge!

1472
01:19:05,867 --> 01:19:07,160
<i>Nice job!</i>

1473
01:19:15,585 --> 01:19:18,088
- Think fast.
<i>- Aloft Elevar!</i>

1474
01:19:53,623 --> 01:19:55,083
Woo-hoo!

1475
01:19:55,667 --> 01:19:57,293
<i>I know
you're stronger than that.</i>

1476
01:19:57,335 --> 01:20:00,046
<i>My little brother
has the magic gift.</i>

1477
01:20:00,088 --> 01:20:01,423
<i>Don't hold back.</i>

1478
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:03,300
<i>Hey. You can do this.</i>

1479
01:20:30,243 --> 01:20:33,204
Okay, come on.
Get down right now.

1480
01:20:55,977 --> 01:20:58,271
Yeah! Yeah!

1481
01:21:04,778 --> 01:21:05,568
Barley!

1482
01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:06,988
Ian! Look!

1483
01:21:10,617 --> 01:21:11,701
Behind you!

1484
01:21:14,954 --> 01:21:16,539
It's a curse.

1485
01:22:10,552 --> 01:22:11,761
Barley, run!

1486
01:22:15,932 --> 01:22:18,101
What do you want? The gem?

1487
01:22:19,102 --> 01:22:20,186
Fine, take it!

1488
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:25,442
Ha-ha!

1489
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:48,506
The Manticore!

1490
01:22:48,548 --> 01:22:49,591
Mom?

1491
01:22:49,757 --> 01:22:52,010
It's okay, boys,
we'll take care...

1492
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:54,262
Whoa... You're tilting!
You're tilting!

1493
01:22:54,387 --> 01:22:56,598
- Mom!
- Go see your father!

1494
01:22:56,723 --> 01:22:59,642
It's okay! If they stab
the beast's core

1495
01:23:00,935 --> 01:23:01,954
with that sword,
the curse will be broken.

1496
01:23:01,978 --> 01:23:03,021
Come on!

1497
01:23:31,633 --> 01:23:34,510
Barley, what I said before...
I am so sorry.

1498
01:23:34,552 --> 01:23:36,429
There's no time.
The sun's about to set.

1499
01:23:38,306 --> 01:23:40,725
Only once is all we get,
grant me this rebirth.

1500
01:23:40,767 --> 01:23:44,312
Till tomorrow's sun has set,
one day to walk the earth!

1501
01:23:47,398 --> 01:23:49,359
Time to crush a curse!

1502
01:23:56,324 --> 01:23:58,076
Ooh, my back.

1503
01:24:03,414 --> 01:24:05,083
I am a mighty warrior.

1504
01:24:15,343 --> 01:24:17,637
I am a mighty warrior!

1505
01:24:23,685 --> 01:24:26,187
Hurry!
I can't hold this for long!

1506
01:24:32,402 --> 01:24:34,696
No! No, no, no!
Barley!

1507
01:24:58,678 --> 01:25:00,722
Boys, it's coming back!

1508
01:25:06,269 --> 01:25:07,395
I'll go distract it.

1509
01:25:07,437 --> 01:25:08,563
What? No!

1510
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:10,106
If you do that,
you'll miss Dad.

1511
01:25:10,148 --> 01:25:13,401
It's okay.
Say hi to Dad for me.

1512
01:25:14,819 --> 01:25:17,905
- No. You go and say goodbye.
- What?

1513
01:25:17,947 --> 01:25:20,491
I had someone
who looked out for me.

1514
01:25:20,533 --> 01:25:22,410
Someone who pushed me to be

1515
01:25:22,452 --> 01:25:24,454
more than I ever
thought I could be.

1516
01:25:24,787 --> 01:25:26,581
I never had a dad,

1517
01:25:27,498 --> 01:25:29,375
but I always had you.

1518
01:25:38,384 --> 01:25:40,011
<i>Bridgrigar Invisia!</i>

1519
01:25:41,721 --> 01:25:43,056
<i>Boombastia!</i>

1520
01:25:52,649 --> 01:25:53,941
<i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

1521
01:26:08,873 --> 01:26:09,916
No!

1522
01:26:17,965 --> 01:26:19,008
No! No, no, no!

1523
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:22,720
Use what I have.

1524
01:26:22,762 --> 01:26:24,555
Uh, what do I have?
I have nothing.

1525
01:26:24,972 --> 01:26:27,558
Splinter.
Magic in every fiber.

1526
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:29,852
<i>Magnora Gantuan!</i>

1527
01:26:31,688 --> 01:26:35,066
No!
<i>Voltar Thundasir!</i>

1528
01:26:41,989 --> 01:26:43,032
Ian!

1529
01:26:43,908 --> 01:26:45,159
<i>Accelior!</i>

1530
01:27:10,643 --> 01:27:11,936
Ian!

1531
01:29:00,545 --> 01:29:01,921
What did he say?

1532
01:29:03,548 --> 01:29:06,551
He said he always thought
his wizard name

1533
01:29:06,592 --> 01:29:09,262
would be Wilden the Whimsical.

1534
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:12,557
Wow. That's really terrible.

1535
01:29:12,682 --> 01:29:14,350
I know.

1536
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:20,022
He also said he's very proud

1537
01:29:20,064 --> 01:29:23,150
of the person
you grew up to be.

1538
01:29:24,235 --> 01:29:28,406
Well, I owe
an awful lot of that to you.

1539
01:29:30,116 --> 01:29:32,618
He kinda said that, too.

1540
01:29:35,454 --> 01:29:38,624
Oh, and he told me
to give you this.

1541
01:30:07,528 --> 01:30:10,573
<i>Long ago,
the world was full of wonder.</i>

1542
01:30:13,284 --> 01:30:16,287
<i>It was adventurous,
exciting,</i>

1543
01:30:16,787 --> 01:30:20,166
<i>and best of all,
there was magic.</i>

1544
01:30:22,877 --> 01:30:24,754
Whoa! Watch it!

1545
01:30:25,671 --> 01:30:28,382
Bullseye!

1546
01:30:28,716 --> 01:30:31,093
And then, with a slash
of my mighty sword,

1547
01:30:31,135 --> 01:30:34,055
I severed the beast's wings
from its wretched body!

1548
01:30:35,264 --> 01:30:38,059
Okay, who wants cake?

1549
01:30:41,687 --> 01:30:44,774
And I think, with a little
bit of magic in your life,

1550
01:30:44,815 --> 01:30:46,692
you can do almost anything.

1551
01:30:46,734 --> 01:30:48,778
Is that how you
put the school back together?

1552
01:30:48,819 --> 01:30:49,862
Uh, yes.

1553
01:30:49,904 --> 01:30:51,256
Is that also
how you destroyed

1554
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:52,615
the school in the first place?

1555
01:30:52,657 --> 01:30:54,408
Uh, also yes.

1556
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:58,579
- Hey, that was great.
- Thanks.

1557
01:30:58,621 --> 01:31:01,290
- You going to the park later?
- Yeah! See you there.

1558
01:31:06,379 --> 01:31:07,922
Mom! Oof!

1559
01:31:10,257 --> 01:31:11,550
Blazey, down!

1560
01:31:11,592 --> 01:31:13,511
Who's a good dragon?
Who's a good dragon?

1561
01:31:13,552 --> 01:31:14,762
So, how was school?

1562
01:31:14,804 --> 01:31:16,305
It was really good.

1563
01:31:16,347 --> 01:31:17,515
Well, all right.

1564
01:31:17,556 --> 01:31:19,475
Hey, there he is.
You workin' hard?

1565
01:31:19,517 --> 01:31:22,019
No, hardly workin'.

1566
01:31:22,061 --> 01:31:25,564
Oh, I gotta go. I'm meeting
the Manticore for a night out.

1567
01:31:25,606 --> 01:31:27,417
<i>We got
a one-one-three in progress.</i>

1568
01:31:27,441 --> 01:31:28,693
<i>All units report.</i>

1569
01:31:28,734 --> 01:31:30,778
Duty calls.
Time to hit the trails.

1570
01:31:30,820 --> 01:31:32,196
Oh, you forgot your keys!

1571
01:31:32,238 --> 01:31:35,700
Don't need 'em.
I was born to run.

1572
01:31:35,741 --> 01:31:36,867

is to take

called the Road of Ruin.

1583
01:32:08,482 --> 01:32:11,068
- Uh... It's too obvious.
- Wait, what?

1584
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:14,071

is never the right one.
