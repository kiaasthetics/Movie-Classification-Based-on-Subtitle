2
00:01:03,849 --> 00:01:05,470
 Yes, you got doughnuts.

3
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:06,990
I already ate all the balsam cream.

4
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:08,870
Kyle?

5
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,390
This place gives me the creeps.

6
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,850
Relax, that popsicle hasn't moved in 50 years.

7
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,830
Someone's hacking the system.

8
00:01:59,170 --> 00:01:59,470
What?

9
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,270
The containment tank is destabilizing.

10
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,010
He's waking up.

11
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,670
We need more guys.

12
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,550
That is all the guys.

13
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,959
Wait a second.

14
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,860
I thought we were going tubing.

15
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,140
Hold on, hold on.

16
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,580
Is this a race?

17
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,040
You're going down.

18
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,340
It is my destiny to claim the throne of family champion hedgehog.

19
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,500
Cute.

20
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,680
Are you sure you want to challenge the fastest creature in the universe?

21
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,480
I mean, that's kind of my whole brand.

22
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,240
Okay, Tom and Maddie, count us down.

23
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,080
Don't worry, little sibling, rivalry is healthy.

24
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,940
Me and my brothers used to do this kind of thing all the time.

25
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,160
Tom, your brothers are lunatics, and neither of them were born with the power to trigger

26
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,540
a global cataclysmic event.

27
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,960
That's a fair point.

28
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,600
Did you hear that, boys?

29
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,280
No cataclysmic events, okay?

30
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,700
Let's keep this cataclysmic-less.

31
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,500
I'm a stronghold of the donuts.

32
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,680
Then on your marks, get set, go!

33
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,920
And away out in front, to the surprise of absolutely no one, it's the blue blur, the

34
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,280
red chute rocket, the one, the only...

35
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,520
Come on, Sonic!

36
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:09,500
Hedgehog!

37
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,720
What, the what now?

38
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,800
I am also defeating you, hedgehog.

39
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,340
Seriously?

40
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,680
All right, you know what?

41
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,540
Time to light the afterburners.

42
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,120
It's a bird!

43
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,260
It's a plane!

44
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,280
It's air hedgehog!

45
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,440
Yes!

46
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,780
I did it!

47
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,220
I...

48
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,760
Lost?

49
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,940
How is that even possible?

50
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,040
I do not lose!

51
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,280
I am also defeating you, hedgehog.

52
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,940
Okay, okay, I get it, man.

53
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,900
No need to rub it in.

54
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,400
Come on, Sonic!

55
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,500
Catch up!

56
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:52,940
Yeah!

57
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,400
Wait, what's going on?

58
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:56,880
Ah!

59
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,600
Why are you guys acting like...

60
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,360
Holograms?

61
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,260
Which means, I remain the undefeated speed champion of all time!

62
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:06,880
Yes!

63
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,340
And the crowd goes wild!

64
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,760
But also, what's going on?

65
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,400
Surprise!

66
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,520
Wait a second, you guys, what is all this?

67
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,600
Happy Be-Arthur Day?

68
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,860
Oh, it's Happy Be-Earth Day.

69
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,560
Today is the anniversary of the day you came to Earth, bud.

70
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,120
It's your Earth Day birthday.

71
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,880
So the race was just a distraction, which I totally didn't bowl for, by the way.

72
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,680
Good try, though.

73
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,660
So you could throw a party for me?

74
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,280
Today we honor you, hedgehog.

75
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,400
If it wasn't for you, none of us would be here right now.

76
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,520
The boys are right, bud.

77
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,300
You know, the day you came to this planet is the day all our lives changed forever.

78
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,380
And we became a family.

79
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,100
You guys, I don't... I don't know what to say.

80
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:53,820
Except...

81
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,000
Let's party!

82
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:56,980
Yeah!

83
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,880
It's now on to the break of dawn!

84
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,760
Thanks for the surprise party.

85
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,280
It really means a lot to me.

86
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,580
Yeah, you deserve it, pal.

87
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,720
No way!

88
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,640
Is that...

89
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:13,880
What?

90
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,260
Dude, you're just for once walking my speed.

91
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,050
Whoa!

92
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,470
This is your...

93
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:26,690
Yep.

94
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,210
My old cave.

95
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,050
Oh, man.

96
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,610
I can't believe this is where you lived all those years.

97
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:32,850
Hey, hey!

98
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,870
My state-of-the-art security system!

99
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,590
It still works.

100
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:39,930
Hey, bud.

101
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,450
What's this?

102
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,250
Wow.

103
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,050
You know, I drew that on my first night on Earth.

104
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,530
I wanted to remember where I came from.

105
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,160
I still miss her.

106
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,600
You think Longclaw would be proud of me?

107
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,820
I know she would, pal.

108
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,360
Because even though you lost her at such a young age,

109
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,320
you didn't let your pain change who you are.

110
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,600
In here.

111
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,230
In my lungs.

112
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,730
Or your heart.

113
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:16,850
Heart, right.

114
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:17,750
Yeah, makes more sense.

115
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,430
Not lungs, heart.

116
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,090
That's the thing about life, Sonic.

117
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,790
It's all about the choices we make.

118
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,290
You're gonna make some good ones, and...

119
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,430
knowing you, you're gonna make some bad ones.

120
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:29,660
But...

121
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,100
as long as you remember to listen to your heart,

122
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,000
you're gonna make the right choice when it matters the most.

123
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,520
Thanks.

124
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,659
I don't know what I'd do without you.

125
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,820
I'd probably be a totally different hedgehog.

126
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,300
2024?

127
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,100
I've been trapped for 50 years?

128
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,300
Yes!

129
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:15,060
Why won't you leave me alone?

130
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:23,230
I have dishonored my marshmallow.

131
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,790
It's really just a question of temperature and distance.

132
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,410
It's not a competition.

133
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,130
This is so nice.

134
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,270
Peace.

135
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,290
Quiet.

136
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:35,210
Finally.

137
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:36,910
Finally.

138
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,270
Hey!

139
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,070
We're trying to have a family movement down here!

140
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,320
Mr. and Mrs. Wachowski.

141
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,680
Aliens.

142
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:49,980
Aliens?

143
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,080
Excuse me?

144
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,620
It's not like we're from different planets.

145
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,320
Oh, yeah, we are.

146
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,380
I guess we are alien.

147
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,140
Please keep your distance.

148
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:55,600
Continue.

149
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,680
I'm Director Rockwell.

150
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,320
There is a very dangerous situation unfolding right now in Tokyo.

151
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,900
Commander Walters is requesting Team Sonic's immediate assistance.

152
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,080
Team Sonic?

153
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,480
Who picked that name?

154
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,240
Love it.

155
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,080
Ten out of ten.

156
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:09,880
No notes.

157
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,600
Tom and Maddie, put the s'mores on ice,

158
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,960
because Team Sonic is off to save the day!

159
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,420
Remember!

160
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,440
Make good choices!

161
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,920
Good evening and welcome to Tails Air Flight 1012.

162
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,640
We're looking at an on-time arrival into Tokyo.

163
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:46,840
Okay, Captain.

164
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,320
We got a rogue alien on the loose.

165
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,280
How do we find him?

166
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,960
Uh, start with the giant fireball?

167
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,000
I love it.

168
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,640
Let's start with the giant fireball.

169
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,620
Finally, some action.

170
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,920
Okay, time to gear up.

171
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,640
Titanium handcuffs.

172
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,440
Completely indestructible.

173
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,760
I don't need your silly gizmos, Fox.

174
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,760
And you know why?

175
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,620
Because I am one million percent muscle.

176
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,840
Yes, good.

177
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,780
You've been listening.

178
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,860
We're over the drop zone.

179
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,140
All right, here we go.

180
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,200
Showtime.

181
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,200
Now look, we don't know if it's Godzilla or Hello Kitty down there,

182
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,960
but as long as we stick together,

183
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,800
there is nothing we can't handle.

184
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,400
Team Sonic on three.

185
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,900
One, two, three.

186
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,480
Team Knuckles.

187
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,860
Talk about low-budget flights.

188
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,180
No food or movies?

189
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,460
We're out of here.

190
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,360
We're out of here.

191
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,000
What happened here?

192
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,780
Looks like Dunn got their butts kicked.

193
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,020
Keep your eyes open.

194
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,220
Tails, anything?

195
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,080
Whoa, these energy readings are off the charts.

196
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,400
Look out!

197
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,300
One million percent.

198
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,300
Wow.

199
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,080
Are you guys seeing this?

200
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,900
He looks just like you.

201
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,560
Impossible.

202
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,120
You're a colorful bunch.

203
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,020
Um, excuse me.

204
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,780
Why do you look like me?

205
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,460
I don't look like you.

206
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,880
You look like me.

207
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,600
Why do you look like me?

208
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,540
Hey, you know what?

209
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,060
I'll ask the questions, new hedgehog.

210
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,200
Who are you?

211
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,500
Why do you look like me?

212
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,140
This is a waste of time.

213
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,140
Walk away before you get hurt.

214
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,900
Whoa, whoa, easy, buddy.

215
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,540
We don't want to fight you.

216
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,980
Actually, Sonic, I would like to fight.

217
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,480
Not now.

218
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,120
Why don't you stop throwing cars at us for a second

219
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,880
and come down here to talk?

220
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,120
You jumped out of a gun helicopter.

221
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,400
There's nothing to talk about.

222
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,760
All right, then.

223
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,500
Enough!

224
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,420
Knuckles, no!

225
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,440
Let us talk with our fists!

226
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:41,780
Knuckles!

227
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,300
Knuckles, Knuckles, are you okay?

228
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,480
No, not really.

229
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,840
Who is this guy?

230
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,080
He is much more impressive than the hedgehog I fought previously.

231
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,200
Dude, I'm standing right here.

232
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,300
Now, come on.

233
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,100
You can't take us all at once.

234
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:10,660
Okay, he took us all at once.

235
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,040
Weakling.

236
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,920
Don't try to follow me.

237
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,340
Sonic, I know that look.

238
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,460
Going after him is a bad idea.

239
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,080
When does that ever stop?

240
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,380
I gotta ask one hedgehog to another.

241
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,860
Who does your highlights?

242
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:43,780
Hey!

243
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,440
Dangerously weaving through traffic is my thing!

244
00:15:53,380 --> 00:16:01,430
I'm about to get started!

245
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:06,670
The more you talk, the harder I want to hit you.

246
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:10,930
Watch out!

247
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,270
I'm gonna throw up.

248
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,230
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

249
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:23,520
Yeah!

250
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,780
21 gigawatts.

251
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:07,930
Are you kidding me?

252
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:08,950
Sonic!

253
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,290
Are you okay?

254
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:11,650
I'm fine, guys.

255
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:16,150
And before you ask, I handcuffed myself for tactical reasons that I do not have time to explain.

256
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,210
You shouldn't have gone off on your own.

257
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,890
We're supposed to be a team.

258
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:20,870
Sorry, buddy.

259
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,630
I'm still working on this teamwork thing.

260
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,110
So now what?

261
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:28,330
Well, I'm not jumping out of any more helicopters until we get some answers from GUN.

262
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,170
We need somewhere to regroup.

263
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,490
I know just the place.

264
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,849
It's an ambush!

265
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,270
You'll never take us alive, foul beast!

266
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,430
Calm down, Knuckles.

267
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:54,849
This is the Chao Garden, one of the top ten must-see spots in all of Tokyo.

268
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,010
It's a perfect place for us to blend in.

269
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,810
Are you Detective Pikachu?

270
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,670
Yes, he is!

271
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,050
He does look like a Pokémon.

272
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,570
Pika Pika!

273
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,190
Commander Walters!

274
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:07,210
Sonic.

275
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,890
Thank God you're all okay.

276
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,410
I'm sure you have questions.

277
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,130
Just a big, ticked-off, red-and-black one?

278
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,570
Who was that guy?

279
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:18,350
Shadow's story began a lot like yours, Sonic.

280
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,490
But where you found family and friends on this planet,

281
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:25,050
Shadow found only pain and loss.

282
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,770
It begins over fifty years ago,

283
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:31,210
with a meteor crash in a quiet corner of Oklahoma.

284
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:35,450
The meteorite contained a life form.

285
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,570
The ultimate life form.

286
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,430
Shadow's power, his Chaos Energy,

287
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,150
went far beyond any living creature.

288
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,490
To discover and believe this power

289
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,390
would usher in a new era for humanity.

290
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:58,770
Dangerous.

291
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:04,360
A terrible accident destroyed the lab,

292
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,060
taking human lives with it.

293
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,380
The project leader was blamed for the incident

294
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,040
and imprisoned.

295
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,300
With the program cancelled,

296
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,280
Shadow was a loose end

297
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,040
no one knew how to deal with.

298
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,020
Too dangerous to be walking free.

299
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,880
Too valuable to destroy.

300
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,540
So I had him placed into stasis.

301
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:28,640
Indefinitely.

302
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,050
Wait a second.

303
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,490
If Shadow's been on ice for fifty years,

304
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,150
someone had to help him escape.

305
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,070
True.

306
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,930
But there's only a few people in the world

307
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,710
who even know of Shadow's existence.

308
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,190
Oh my God!

309
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,390
Get down!

310
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,010
Egg drones?

311
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,570
But Robotnik is supposed to be dead.

312
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,210
Konichiwa!

313
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,530
I'm sorry.

314
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,210
We already had our big motorcycle chase for the evening.

315
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:10,990
Commander Walters.

316
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,370
Commander Walters, are you okay?

317
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:16,510
Sonic.

318
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,460
Take this.

319
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:21,740
What is it?

320
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,720
A key.

321
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,440
To the most powerful weapon God has ever built.

322
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,080
You're the only one I trust to keep it safe.

323
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,360
Commander Walters.

324
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,100
Commander, secure the perimeter.

325
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,410
Commander Vak is on Earth.

326
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,940
His launch key is missing.

327
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,740
I knew they couldn't be trusted.

328
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,720
Why are we running from God?

329
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,500
Aren't we on the same team?

330
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,940
Until we get more information,

331
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,640
we're not trusting anyone.

332
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,440
Follow me.

333
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,760
Hold it right there, Tokyo Drift.

334
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,500
Who are you?

335
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,680
It's the goat milker.

336
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,580
It's the goat milker.

337
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:47,780
Relax.

338
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,240
I'm not here to fight.

339
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,060
Then why are you here?

340
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,820
And why did you free Shadow?

341
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,560
Are you kidding?

342
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,700
The last thing we want is more super-powered hedgehogs.

343
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,600
There are too many hedgehogs running around.

344
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,120
The doctor had nothing to do with it.

345
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,080
And I can prove it.

346
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:19,570
Please.

347
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,730
Join me in the crib.

348
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:26,170
And now back to la ultima passion.

349
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,470
I have fallen in love with another.

350
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:31,790
But who, Gabriela?

351
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,650
Tell me.

352
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:33,650
Who?

353
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,710
My twin brother, Pablo?

354
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,410
Bastardo!

355
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,430
Buenos dias, hermano.

356
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:46,830
No!

357
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,290
Let that be a lesson to you, Juan.

358
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,890
Family is a field of emotional claymores

359
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:58,530
that leave you abandoned,

360
00:23:59,150 --> 00:23:59,570
betrayed,

361
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:03,430
and weeping while you eat cake,

362
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,450
which creates copious amounts of adipose tissue

363
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,790
in what some calloused individuals refer to as

364
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,170
man boobs.

365
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,650
Doctor, we have visitors.

366
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:35,910
Really?

367
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,550
I thought I was having an anthropomorphic nightmare

368
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,950
where the only person I could trust in the world

369
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,510
showed up with all my worst enemies

370
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,910
while I was in a bathroom

371
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:47,170
playing congas on my big, fat belly.

372
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:48,610
Sorry, sir.

373
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:49,950
I don't believe it.

374
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,370
Eggman's alive.

375
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,910
And he's never looked worse.

376
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:58,170
Well, maybe this is what not giving a damn

377
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,130
what you think I look like looks like.

378
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:03,590
Sir, right now we have an even bigger problem.

379
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,110
Oh, come on.

380
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,550
There's an imposter out there using your technology.

381
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:10,890
Imposter?

382
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,070
That's impasa?

383
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:12,870
What?

384
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,130
No.

385
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:18,450
My sweet, mechanized spawn.

386
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,630
Whoever this party-pooping posse is looking for

387
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,390
has stolen my persona

388
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:28,210
and the precious babies from my egg sack.

389
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:34,650
Well, I'll soon egg sack my revenge.

390
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,410
You see what I did there?

391
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,950
It's time for the dramatic soap opera twist

392
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:43,530
where this Pablo reveals his wand.

393
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:48,130
I cross-reference the precise coordinates

394
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,310
of each drone's energy spikes.

395
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,810
I can track my babies

396
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,670
to the imposter's base of operations

397
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,630
right about there.

398
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,770
Sonic, I hate to say it,

399
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,850
but I think we're both after the same person.

400
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:04,650
Hold on, hold on.

401
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:08,650
You're not suggesting we team up with Dr. Robotstink, are you?

402
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,310
Perhaps the fox is right.

403
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,290
It could be our only chance to find this mysterious,

404
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,950
more impressive hedgehog.

405
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:15,890
Ugh.

406
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:17,330
All right, Egghead.

407
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:20,190
I hate to say it, but it looks like we're partners.

408
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,050
On one condition.

409
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:27,230
Dude, you have serious issues.

410
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,350
Let's do this!

411
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:35,590
Shit!

412
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,430
No!

413
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,370
I'm the troublemaker,

414
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,330
the killing skater!

415
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,510
I'm the hand-kissing,

416
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,990
and I kill in a second!

417
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,550
Tinkertailer, I need room.

418
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,210
Think Elvis, circa 1976.

419
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,930
Sir, I don't have the proper materials.

420
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:14,830
Pantom!

421
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:18,950
Resourceful.

422
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,790
Hey, this is a restricted area.

423
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:02,250
No, it's okay.

424
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,830
She's the professor's granddaughter.

425
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,550
He takes her everywhere.

426
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:07,990
Welcome to the lab, Maria.

427
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,490
I'm Captain Walters.

428
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,150
Oh, do you know where my room is?

429
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,630
Yeah, down the hall to the right.

430
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:13,830
Make yourself at home.

431
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,930
But, um, let's lose the skates.

432
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:17,790
Okay, get out.

433
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:18,550
Okay.

434
00:28:32,470 --> 00:30:02,800
Well, it's all right

435
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,680
Riding around in the breeze

436
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,380
Well, it's all right

437
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,220
Well, it's all right

438
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,920
Doing the best you can

439
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,120
Well, it's all right

440
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,600
As long as you lend a hand

441
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,420
You'll think of me and wonder where I am these days

442
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,620
Maybe somewhere down the road in somebody's place

443
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,620
Well, it's all right

444
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,720
Even when push comes to shove

445
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,260
Well, it's all right

446
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,440
Everybody's got something to love

447
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,960
Well, it's all right

448
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,180
Everybody's got something to love

449
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,720
Well, it's all right

450
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:22,280
I'm going to the end of the line

451
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,620
Wow, look at all those stars

452
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,660
They're like diamonds

453
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:36,470
My grandfather says it can take hundreds of years for the light of a star to reach Earth

454
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:41,290
And by the time we see it, the star might not even exist anymore

455
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:44,010
Isn't that crazy?

456
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:44,110
What do you mean?

457
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,140
The light shines, even though the star is gone

458
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,040
Yeah, it does

459
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:56,750
I wonder which one you came from, Shadow

460
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,010
I don't know

461
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,070
I don't know anything about my home

462
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:04,030
This is your home, Shadow

463
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:05,370
All right

464
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:17,950
Maria, do you think I'm dangerous?

465
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,890
What are you talking about?

466
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:25,950
The way the scientists look at me, I can tell they're afraid

467
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:29,790
Like I'm the horrible thing from that movie we watched

468
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:34,010
I don't know what I am

469
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,640
You're my friend

470
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,140
And you can do or be anything you want

471
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,660
Not because of your powers, but because of who you are in here

472
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:56,470
I don't know what I'd do without you

473
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:38,760
Professor?

474
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,820
It's good to see you, Shadow

475
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,450
I can't get her out of my head

476
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,870
The pain, it's too much

477
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:54,390
And that is why we have to punish them

478
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:02,270
Okay, I don't like you and you don't like me, let's get this over with quickly

479
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,810
Out of my way, dorkupine

480
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,530
Dorkupine? Really clever

481
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,920
This door is six inch thick solid steel and a pressurized latch

482
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:21,600
I'll need a moment to calculate the molecular density and invert the venting mechanics

483
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,080
I unlocked it

484
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,260
Subtle as always, fist for brains

485
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,160
Easy, Shadow

486
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,560
Those are the guests I've been expecting

487
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,240
Let's give them a warm welcome

488
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,460
What is this place?

489
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,180
Looks like a military base, but nobody's been here for years

490
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,720
I wonder if it's haunted

491
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,980
Haunted? Nobody said anything about being haunted

492
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:56,440
What's the matter? You afraid of g-g-ghosts?

493
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,520
Nothing scares an echidna warrior

494
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,980
Uh, yeah, do you remember what happened last movie night?

495
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,040
There's no such thing as a friendly ghost

496
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,360
So, which way do we go?

497
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,860
I know, we should split up

498
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,240
Everyone with hideous brightly colored fur take the left in the middle, Stone and I will go right

499
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,580
No, no, no, no, no, I'm not letting you out of my sight

500
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,380
Tails, you and Stone go left

501
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,680
Knuckles, you take the middle

502
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,560
Eggman, you and me go right

503
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,800
By all means

504
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,460
We could use some time together to work on your trust issues

505
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,280
You know what? You're right

506
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,800
I should be more trusting

507
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,540
I mean, you've only tried to kill me twice

508
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,540
Just a dark, creepy hallway

509
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,820
Nothing to be afraid of

510
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,180
You hear that, ghosts?

511
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,800
You don't frighten me

512
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,320
Get a grip

513
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,560
I'm just gonna come right out and say this

514
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,420
You're adorable

515
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,040
Thanks

516
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,760
So, what's it like being Sonic's assistant?

517
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,880
You have a daily routine?

518
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,120
Paid time off? Benefits?

519
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,160
Oh, I'm not Sonic's assistant

520
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,280
We're teammates

521
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,380
He's the leader

522
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,520
Knuckles is the muscle

523
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,980
And I'm the gadget guy

524
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,620
We all have a role to play

525
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,360
That's what makes the team so special

526
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,200
That and the fact we're best friends

527
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,020
You are

528
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,260
Well, yeah, just like you and Eggman, right?

529
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,220
Uh, yeah

530
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,780
Of course, yes

531
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,680
Me and the doctor

532
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,080
Best of friends

533
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,420
That's definitely what we are

534
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:10,010
Look at all this stuff

535
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:13,730
This was more than just a military base or lab

536
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,710
It was a home

537
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,250
People lived here

538
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,370
He had a family

539
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,650
Is that what I smell?

540
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,490
A stench of domestic harmony?

541
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:28,630
You ever wonder what your life would have been like if you had a family?

542
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,570
Hmm, no

543
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,730
Maybe you wouldn't have gone full supervillain

544
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:35,450
I have no parents, no aunts, no uncles

545
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:38,210
And something about my attitude renders me

546
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,710
Undesirable to all possible genders

547
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,610
My future is a contact

548
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,890
The robotic name ends

549
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,550
Avec moi

550
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:55,090
Yes, I know French

551
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:00,410
Whoa

552
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,370
Is this where you grew up, Shadow?

553
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,950
No wonder you're so mad

554
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:10,150
This place could really use a beanbag chair and some comic books

555
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,950
What happened here?

556
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,370
I'm tired of giving you warnings

557
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,330
Where'd you go, hedgehog?

558
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,130
I wasn't finished trauma dumping

559
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,870
My darlings

560
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:33,230
My hanging weddings

561
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:36,570
Memories

562
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:44,650
Lie the corners of my mind

563
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:50,930
Misty watercolor memories

564
00:38:53,510 --> 00:39:01,130
Of the way we went

565
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:06,720
I don't believe it

566
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,400
Don't you?

567
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,400
It's impossible

568
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:08,740
Is it?

569
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,460
It couldn't be

570
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,520
Are you?

571
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,360
Imposter!

572
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,140
You stole my babies

573
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,080
They know who their real daddy is

574
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,560
Drone Napper?

575
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,040
Magnificent creations, my boy

576
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,100
I borrowed them to lure you here

577
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,100
And reunite our family

578
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,220
Is he I owe?

579
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,760
I'm your grandfather

580
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,980
Gerald Robotnik

581
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,490
My grandfather?

582
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,180
And why?

583
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,600
And who did what with whom?

584
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:57,580
You hail from an ancestry of excellence

585
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,020
Tied directly a moi

586
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:03,580
Yes, I know French

587
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:08,050
You do look like me

588
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:10,470
But fatter and older

589
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:13,070
And there's that funny smell

590
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:17,610
But the resemblance is uncanny

591
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:19,570
It's as if

592
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:22,530
We were two characters in a movie

593
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:24,890
Being played by the same actor

594
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,230
But I need real proof

595
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:27,810
I will

596
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:29,270
We have very little time

597
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:32,810
But I could field a couple of queries

598
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:36,250
Name the most elegant formula in mathematics

599
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,570
Euler's identity

600
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:40,210
e to the i times pi plus one equals zilch

601
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:42,930
European capitals arranged alphabetically by the fourth letter

602
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:45,430
Riga, Monaco, Sarajevo, Toronto

603
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:47,290
The speed of light divided by the speed of sound

604
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:49,310
Divided by the speed of the bus and the movie speed

605
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,670
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep

606
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:53,670
17,893.3333

607
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,150
Rounding up

608
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,430
17,894 mph

609
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,610
And for all the marbles

610
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:02,130
Good, I lost mine

611
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,710
Rare lung disease

612
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:07,350
And the longest word in the English dictionary

613
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,890
In

614
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:12,530
Numeral ultramicroscopic silico-volcano-coliosis

615
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,730
Pop, pop

616
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:16,590
In the saggy flesh

617
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:19,450
But looking pretty good for a 110

618
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,950
Oh, grab me, boo

619
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:29,070
Where have you been

620
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,510
My entire life

621
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:34,450
Wait

622
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,270
Where have you been

623
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:37,810
My entire life

624
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,670
Locked in a top secret prison

625
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,970
For the last 50 years

626
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:46,630
Made it kind of hard to send Christmas cards

627
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:50,250
Now, you're probably wondering

628
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,370
Why I brought you here

629
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:53,590
You didn't bring me here

630
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:57,310
I used my unparalleled intellect to track you down

631
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:00,590
For the plan I concocted with my unparalleled intellect

632
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,170
You'll see

633
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:05,650
I have the answer to everything

634
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,910
Come on, kiddo

635
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:28,290
What, Tommy, this is some kind of concussion-induced nightmare?

636
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:00,990
There's two Eggmen now?

637
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:03,010
Double your villains, double your fun

638
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:05,590
Two Robotniks are way worse than one

639
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:05,990
Chespa?

640
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:07,790
No

641
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:10,950
Stone, why are you tied up?

642
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:12,490
Do that on your own time

643
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:13,330
You sicken me

644
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:16,330
You must be the long-lost grandson

645
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:19,470
And you must be another stinking hedgehog

646
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:21,690
So you're the one behind all this

647
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:22,890
The Shadow Breakout

648
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,170
The attack on Wolters

649
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:25,570
That musty old man smell

650
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:29,210
How dare you insult me with your unsolicited exposition

651
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:30,870
Shadow, get the key

652
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:32,610
Where is it?

653
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:34,690
Ha, good one, Hot Topic

654
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:36,850
Do you really think we'd be that stupid

655
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:38,910
To bring the key right to you?

656
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:40,770
Yup, we're that stupid

657
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:42,870
G.U.N. took everything from us

658
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:46,130
And now we are going to take everything from them

659
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,370
With this?

660
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,710
My masterpiece of malevolence

661
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:53,390
The Eclipse Cannon

662
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:56,490
In exchange for my freedom

663
00:43:56,490 --> 00:44:01,650
I gave G.U.N. the most powerful weapon mankind has ever seen

664
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:06,390
Capable of delivering a precision strike anywhere on Earth

665
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,910
Our first target, G.U.N. headquarters

666
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:13,290
But firing a weapon that powerful

667
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:15,630
Could threaten millions of innocent lives

668
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:17,030
Yeah, terror-bite me

669
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:22,570
This is one of two keys required to launch the Eclipse Cannon

670
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:25,110
The other is locked inside G.U.N. headquarters

671
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:26,610
Once we have both

672
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:30,270
I will take rightful control of my weapon

673
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:31,710
I'm in

674
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:40,250
Holy crap

675
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:42,110
Suspicious and crustaceous

676
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:45,710
Thank you so much for inspiring this little adventure

677
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:48,050
It really worked out for me

678
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:51,430
And you wonder why I have trust issues

679
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:55,030
Shadow, wait, don't do this

680
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:58,890
I know you're hurting, but don't let that change who you are inside

681
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:02,970
I've spent 50 years reliving what they did to her

682
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:06,170
This is who I am inside

683
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,300
Uh, nice magic marble, real scary

684
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,460
That actually is real scary

685
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,040
It's a mini black hole

686
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,640
It's going to suck in all the matter in this base

687
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,300
Fear not, friends

688
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,720
Even my teeth are muscles

689
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,500
Huh?

690
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:44,860
Sonic, try to reach one of my rings

691
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:46,100
Got one

692
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,420
Guess this out, Trenchard

693
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:53,480
Come on

694
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,980
Come on

695
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,680
Come on

696
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,980
Come on

697
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,760
Come on

698
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:28,670
I've spent years trying to cleanse the cosmos

699
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:32,010
Of that spiny blue speed freak

700
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:34,390
And you did it

701
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:37,130
In one afternoon

702
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,590
There's nothing we can't destroy together, my boy

703
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:44,950
Charting route to G.U.N. headquarters in London, sirs

704
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:47,890
ETA four hours, as the crowd flies

705
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:50,210
By all accounts, we're ahead of schedule

706
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:55,470
We should take this time to get to know each other better

707
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:57,190
Wow, what?

708
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:02,590
You mean, spend some quality time?

709
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:06,270
You've waited for this your whole life

710
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:13,610
How would you choose to spend one perfect day with your new grand pal?

711
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:09,310
Ooh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho

712
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:13,450
You know it seems the moment's all about

713
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:17,910
It only makes it worse to live without

714
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:50,930
And done, masterpiece, look at that

715
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:51,470
Yay!

716
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:55,630
It's really been great having time to ourselves

717
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:59,890
Right, absolutely, I just feel so relaxed, you know, clear-headed

718
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:02,250
Mm, look at all these new interests we've found

719
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:03,410
I know, so many hobbies

720
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:04,250
So many

721
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:08,490
After the action and adventure of the last few years, I could get used to this

722
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:08,910
Same

723
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:18,450
Tom, Maddie, we need your help on a super... Knuckles, do you mind?

724
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:19,890
Oh, excuse me

725
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:23,870
Tom, Maddie, we need your help on a super dangerous top-secret mission

726
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:27,170
Thank God

727
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:27,410
Let's go

728
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:28,150
Yeah, we're in

729
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:30,530
Really? You're in? Just like that?

730
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:33,530
Yes, it was getting so boring without you guys here

731
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:35,210
So, boring, no, not taken

732
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:37,750
I mean, whatever crazy plan you're cooking up, the answer's yes

733
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:41,210
Great, but first things first, what is that?

734
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:43,670
Oh, this is...

735
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:44,450
Little Tom!

736
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:45,390
It'd be great

737
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,640
I told you to get rid of that, it's very creepy

738
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,220
That's all there is to get rid of you

739
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:53,200
Okay, let's cross it off

740
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,320
You are in so much trouble

741
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,720
Okay, this is it, the belly of the beast, gun headquarters in London

742
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:05,380
Tom, we're finally gonna get to see London together

743
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,360
Hey, I told you we'd get there someday, baby

744
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:11,400
Okay, so here's the plan, I run in super fast

745
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:16,160
Right over that water, no problem, then right when I get to the...

746
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,740
What just happened?

747
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,500
Congratulations, you just got incinerated by their energy shield

748
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:25,240
We'll need to shut it down by planting a USB drive in their server room

749
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,140
That will give me full control over it

750
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,660
That's what we need you two for

751
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,320
We're badass spies, that's what we are

752
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,320
Mr. and Mrs. Smith

753
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:36,700
Once we disable the shield, you'll face the laser haul

754
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:41,440
These high-density bad boys will cut you into tiny pieces

755
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,720
And cut those pieces into even tinier pieces

756
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,760
Once again?

757
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,680
Can't we just get Tom Cruise to do this?

758
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:53,640
Nope, because not even he could break into the vault

759
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,360
Why is it empty in there?

760
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,220
Because we have no idea what's on the other side of that door

761
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:00,960
To prevent the vault from ever being accessed by a ring

762
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,960
All images and schematics have been wiped from GUN's database

763
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:09,140
So for the last leg of this heist, we're going in blind

764
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:19,400
Okay, I'm just gonna say it, it sounds like this plan will work a heck of a lot better

765
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:24,080
If Sonic used the Master Emerald to go golden god mode to get the key

766
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,260
No way, Maddy

767
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:29,040
The Master Emerald is too powerful to ever use again

768
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,620
We made a promise to each other to keep it hidden

769
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,940
In a location only Knuckles knows

770
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:36,000
As guardian of the Master Emerald

771
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,180
Anyone who tries to take it away for any reason

772
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,060
Will become a sworn enemy

773
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,260
Okay, okay, sheesh

774
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:45,160
No need to get all growly on me, buddy

775
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:48,040
You guys are always telling us to make good choices

776
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,220
Well, this is the right choice

777
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:54,220
Okay, I guess we're going to

778
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:17,350
GUN headquarters is right there

779
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:21,590
Let me go in, get the key, and destroy anyone in my way

780
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:23,130
I want revenge

781
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:24,490
Patience, Shadow

782
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:26,930
Just let us handle this

783
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:29,190
And I promise

784
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:31,250
You'll have revenge

785
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:35,070
On a scale you couldn't possibly imagine

786
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:36,970
Come on, granddaddy-o

787
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:39,690
We've got dirt to do

788
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:41,130
Suits

789
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:42,670
Right here, sir

790
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:45,730
Stone, babysit the hedgehog

791
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,510
Keep the crab on a low boil

792
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:51,350
It's time for more family bonding

793
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:57,150
Come on, Shadow

794
00:52:58,150 --> 00:52:59,990
Got fresh avocados in the crab

795
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:01,370
We'll make guac

796
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:05,130
Revenge guac

797
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:15,270
Guys, are you ready for me yet?

798
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:17,270
I've been waiting here all day

799
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:22,730
Sonic, we literally just started

800
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:25,230
Tom, Maddy, are you in position and ready?

801
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:26,710
We were born ready

802
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:27,590
Let's do this

803
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:28,910
Knuckles, how about you?

804
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:31,290
I have taken my perch atop the giant clock

805
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:34,090
Now, where is this glass I'm supposed to break?

806
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:38,130
Actually, Knuckles, your job is to break glass in case of emergency

807
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:39,050
Understood

808
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:43,430
I will shatter this glass like the jaw of a vile foe

809
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:45,030
In case of emergency

810
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:48,050
I will pulverize it like the skull of a loathsome vile

811
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:51,410
Just to be clear, the emergency is the important part

812
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:55,810
The glass will beg for mercy under the shadow of my mighty fist

813
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:57,150
Guys, remember, we're a team

814
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:57,910
Now, let's focus

815
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:58,490
Please

816
00:53:58,490 --> 00:53:59,990
You know what? Let's move on

817
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,930
All right, everyone knows what to do

818
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:04,150
Tom and Maddy, you guys plant the USB drive

819
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:05,350
I'll disable the traps

820
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:06,910
Sonic will snag the launch key

821
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,110
And, Knuckles, you stand by to...

822
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:11,050
Break glass in case of emergency

823
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:12,830
See? He gets it

824
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:13,970
Then we're all set

825
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:15,470
Hologram time

826
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,280
You go first

827
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:22,040
Tom, it's me, Rachel

828
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,080
Can you believe it? We're both in London together

829
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,940
Have you met your sister? Try again

830
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:28,800
Unless you're not up for this mission

831
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:31,540
Yeah, maybe when you'll be back in Green Hills baking sourdough

832
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:32,920
Thomas Michael Wachowski

833
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:33,200
Yeah

834
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,960
You brought aliens to my wedding, punched out my husband and buried me in an avalanche

835
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,220
Your day of reckoning is at hand

836
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:40,180
Yeah, that's perfect

837
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,240
Okay, now for her better half

838
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:46,360
Oh, my name is Randall

839
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,620
And I have too much to handle

840
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,080
Welcome to the gun show

841
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:55,260
Baby, would you describe me as jacked, juiced, or shredded?

842
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:58,340
I would describe your head as swollen

843
00:54:58,340 --> 00:54:59,660
Let's get to work

844
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:04,840
Agent Randall, Handle

845
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,780
I'm here to have lunch with my lovely wife, Rachel

846
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,380
I'm sorry, Agent Handle

847
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:11,440
This facility is currently locked down

848
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,320
Come on, level clearance only

849
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:14,600
One minute

850
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,860
Tails, we have a problem here

851
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:21,640
Wow, they must have tightened security after Shadow's escape

852
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,960
I got this

853
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,740
You must be new here

854
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:28,220
Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Rachel

855
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:30,340
Rachel gonna get you fired

856
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:33,300
Do you know what the gun stands for?

857
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:35,340
Of course, guardian unit

858
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:38,500
Getting ultra nasty

859
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:43,060
Do you want me to get ultra nasty?

860
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,140
Nasty, nasty

861
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:46,000
No, ma'am

862
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:46,740
Okay, then

863
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:50,460
Then go ahead and take those little sad fingers and start tippity-tap-tap-tap

864
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,100
That's right, go on

865
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,060
Sorry for the inconvenience, ma'am

866
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,680
That's what I thought

867
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:04,940
My God, I love being Rachel

868
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:15,960
Did it work?

869
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:17,220
Yeah

870
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,720
Director Rockwell, seeking access to the server room

871
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,600
Just one moment, ma'am

872
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,980
Oh no, it's her, it's her, it's the real her

873
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:33,120
What do we do?

874
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:34,580
Quick, change faces

875
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:35,480
Okay, did it work?

876
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:36,540
What am I...

877
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:37,880
What's going on?

878
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:39,960
What am I doing wrong?

879
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:40,160
Ow

880
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,760
Aye-aye, captain

881
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,060
Aye-aye, captain

882
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,420
Who are you? What am I?

883
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:51,480
I'm Anna Tushkin

884
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,360
Gee, get it together

885
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:58,920
Okay, Tails, what are we looking for?

886
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:02,420
The security server is in the seventh row, 23rd cabinet

887
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,240
Are you guys finished yet?

888
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,500
This is taking forever

889
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:08,940
Uh-oh

890
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:11,360
Has the time come to break the glass?

891
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,980
Or at least break something

892
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:15,420
All right, hang tight guys, Maddie's about to insert the drive

893
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:16,900
Ready?

894
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,560
Three, two, one

895
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,080
Go

896
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:28,690
It didn't work

897
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:29,690
Can you put it in the right way?

898
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:30,690
Try punching it

899
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:32,570
Do not try punching it

900
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:32,890
Ow

901
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:34,530
Take it out and blow on it

902
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:34,950
Yes

903
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:36,970
Come on, Tom

904
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:42,390
There's absolutely no scientific evidence to support...

905
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:44,550
Never mind, it worked

906
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:45,690
A little trick from the 90s

907
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:47,790
I mean, best decade ever, right?

908
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:50,370
I'm shutting down the outside sensors now

909
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:50,730
Yes

910
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:53,210
Uh, hold on

911
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:55,950
Is there supposed to be another USB drive here?

912
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:57,790
One with a giant mustache on it?

913
00:57:58,610 --> 00:57:59,610
Oh no

914
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:02,150
I've got two heat signatures en route to the vault

915
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:03,550
Which can only mean...

916
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:12,570
Our robotics have entered the chat

917
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:12,890
Wait

918
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:15,510
Wait

919
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:16,310
Poppyseed?

920
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:19,270
Grand Geezer?

921
00:58:20,190 --> 00:58:21,030
Donde esta?

922
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:22,550
I'm right here

923
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:26,370
If you weren't family, I could have cut you like a peasant

924
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:29,850
I mean, try to keep up

925
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:36,250
And now back to la ultima passion

926
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:41,250
Ultima passion can only belong to one

927
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:42,030
No

928
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:46,150
It can only belong to one

929
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:49,070
Gabriella, she killed them both

930
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:51,690
She's not a prize to be won

931
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:53,990
Kill this, murder that

932
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:55,970
You need to lighten up, Shadow

933
00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:57,550
We're about to rule the world

934
00:58:58,250 --> 00:58:59,330
When we're done

935
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:02,470
There won't be anything left to rule

936
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:04,010
That is dark

937
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:05,470
Even for you

938
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:07,910
What are you and the professor up to?

939
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:08,710
Hello

940
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:10,410
What's this?

941
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:12,790
I knew I saw an outside signal

942
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:17,230
Mario, I guess someone forgot to flush

943
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,240
What now, my cunning cohort?

944
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,440
Just a little teamwork

945
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:50,360
Hey

946
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,420
The lasers

947
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,220
Don't seem to be penetrating my suit

948
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:01,360
They're conforming to the shape of my bodacious barred deck

949
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,220
Of course

950
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:08,440
I designed these suits to create a field of laser-bending thermal distortion

951
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,380
Wasn't sure it would work till now

952
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:12,540
You're a heartless son

953
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,800
Rotten to the core

954
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,500
I'm surprised

955
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,980
So now we can just dance right through?

956
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,340
That sounds like a challenge

957
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:45,540
If you think about it, so many people do

958
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:46,980
Be cool and a little smarter

959
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,500
And you shouldn't even care

960
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:50,640
About those losers in the air

961
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,560
And the crooked stare

962
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:54,060
Cause there's a party over here

963
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:55,240
So you might as well be here

964
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,140
If people care

965
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,460
We are all the

966
01:00:58,460 --> 01:00:58,980
Destroyer

967
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:27,360
Hello, welcome to my lecture, I hope you're having a good time.

968
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:56,740
Welcome to my lecture, I hope you're having a good time.

969
01:01:56,740 --> 01:02:02,000
Hear ye, hear ye. Sonic the Hedgehog wants a cup of tea. Hold this for me please.

970
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,960
You're not gonna make it. I can make it.

971
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:16,920
You're not gonna make it. I'm gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it.

972
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:33,880
You're not gonna make it. You're not gonna make it. You're not gonna make it. You're not gonna make it.

973
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:43,120
Our destiny awaits. Stop right there, robo scum. Let's do this.

974
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:55,620
Too slow, Eggman. Now, if you don't mind, I've gotta get that key.

975
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:04,620
Why can't I use my beautiful feet? Because this vault is armed with variable gravity.

976
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:13,380
No kidding. Green goes up and red takes you down hard. Rockwell, listen to me. The Robotniks are

977
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:17,880
They're planning on stealing the second key, just like you are. Yes, I'm aware.

978
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:26,220
I called it the second Commander Walters was attacked, so thank you for taking the bait

979
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:34,000
and falling right into my trap. I don't believe this. I know, grandson. A woman in the military.

980
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:48,180
Let's go. Robotnik. You're going full spandex, huh? Who's the fossil? That's my grandfather,

981
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:55,140
you dough-eating dimwit civil. Who are they? A couple of bleeding hearts here to rescue their

982
01:03:55,140 --> 01:04:02,280
emotional support animals. Enough. It's over. The only way you're leaving here is in handcuffs.

983
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:07,380
There is no other way out. You know, there might be one other way out.

984
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:10,940
And what is that supposed to mean? Hey, big guy, I think it's time to

985
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,540
break class in case of emergency.

986
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:26,800
Nothing can stop Team Knuckles. Open fire.

987
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:31,060
God, Knuckles, turn this stuff off. Hurry. On it.

988
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:33,580
Uh-oh.

989
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,000
See how you like it.

990
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:55,720
Can you move? No, not at all. Tails, can you? No, I'm stuck.

991
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,240
They might be here a while.

992
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:03,520
Where's the key?

993
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,480
What was that? We might have a problem.

994
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:17,399
No, no, no, no, no.

995
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:49,440
I can't move. I'm moving. Grandson, hey.

996
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:58,160
No, no, no. I'm almost there.

997
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:23,690
Ow. That was so not worth it.

998
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:30,490
You okay? Yeah, I'm good.

999
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:32,430
Sonic. Hey.

1000
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:39,530
Sonic one, concrete boulder zero. Thanks for the save.

1001
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:43,350
Getting a little close, don't you think? Secure the room.

1002
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:46,850
She's got the key.

1003
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:50,650
I got an idea.

1004
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:03,570
Commander Walters. Sir, you're...

1005
01:07:03,570 --> 01:07:07,670
Still alive? I'll die before I let that key fall into the wrong hands.

1006
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:11,010
Thanks for keeping it safe. I'll take it from here.

1007
01:07:14,050 --> 01:07:21,960
That's an order, Director Rockwell. Now, organize the reinforcements.

1008
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:24,000
Yes, sir.

1009
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:33,640
Guys, guys, I got the key. I repeat, I got the key. Now, let's get out of here.

1010
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,600
Commander Walters. No, no, no, wait.

1011
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:05,140
Everyone's clear. Come on, let's go. You, what are you... Tom.

1012
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:11,980
Tom, Tom, what happened? Speak to me. Come on, come on, come on, come on. It's going to be okay.

1013
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,860
Please, please, please get up. Come on, please wake up.

1014
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:19,760
Wake up, wake up, wake up, come on. Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up.

1015
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:20,820
Who are you?

1016
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:31,190
What did you do? What I had to.

1017
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:35,450
Oh, my God, Tom.

1018
01:08:38,610 --> 01:08:40,110
Help me up, Tim.

1019
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:49,410
Any tricks up your sleeve, Captain Gruntastic?

1020
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:58,210
We got what we came for.

1021
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:05,050
Great job, Shadow. We have both keys.

1022
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,210
So where's your little science project?

1023
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:13,070
It's closer than you think, my boy.

1024
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:20,090
Welcome to my masterpiece.

1025
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:28,590
I must hand it to Gunn. They built her to my exact specifications.

1026
01:09:34,179 --> 01:09:36,500
Remarkable. Astounding.

1027
01:09:37,159 --> 01:09:41,200
Yes, that's my genius, Grand Gino.

1028
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,740
And I have one more surprise.

1029
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,700
It's a new suit.

1030
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:01,380
Gee.

1031
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:25,380
I'm a chip off the old block. I'm a chip off the old block.

1032
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:27,960
I'm a chip off the old block.

1033
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:32,080
What do you want, Stone? I'm busy.

1034
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,800
Doctor, I have a bad feeling about this.

1035
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:37,760
I don't think your grandfather's been completely honest with us.

1036
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,960
Something Shadow said. There's more to their plan.

1037
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:45,980
How dare you?

1038
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,920
You've been jealous of my long-lost grand pop-tart since the very beginning.

1039
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,840
I no longer require your obsequious groveling.

1040
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,980
Consider this your notice of termination.

1041
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:00,160
Your letter of reference will be ill for loser.

1042
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:04,340
Of course, I don't expect you to stay on until you've been successfully cloned.

1043
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:07,280
But you and I are done.

1044
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:10,360
Like a blackened catfish dinner.

1045
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:13,780
Sir, it's too dangerous and I'm not there to protect you.

1046
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:15,260
I already lost you once.

1047
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:16,720
Unsubscribe, blackened reporter.

1048
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:19,760
I can't lose you again.

1049
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:29,710
To the honors, grandson.

1050
01:11:36,390 --> 01:13:07,060
Be okay, Sonic.

1051
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,540
It'll be okay?

1052
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:11,800
Tom is fighting for his life and you think it'll be okay?

1053
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:15,000
The fox is simply trying to comfort you.

1054
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:16,800
Comfort's not what I need right now.

1055
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:18,420
I need to stop them.

1056
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,180
By any means necessary.

1057
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,060
Wait, you don't mean...

1058
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:23,660
The Master Emerald.

1059
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:26,760
The Emerald must never be wielded for vengeance.

1060
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:27,960
Not ever.

1061
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:30,100
We swore a sacred oath.

1062
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:31,900
Don't talk to me about oaths.

1063
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:32,420
Not now.

1064
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:35,740
But you told Tom using the Emerald wasn't the right choice.

1065
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:37,940
Well, now it's the only choice.

1066
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:41,320
And if neither of you have the guts to help me, then I'll do it alone.

1067
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:43,740
But I thought the three of us were a team.

1068
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,820
I thought that's what made us special.

1069
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,000
I'm not asking you twice, Knuckles.

1070
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:51,000
Where is the Master Emerald?

1071
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:56,280
Your heart is being consumed by anger, Hedgehog.

1072
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,540
You are in no condition to make decisions right now.

1073
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,300
I know you're upset about Tom.

1074
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:02,420
We all are.

1075
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:03,520
Last chance.

1076
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:06,280
Where is it?

1077
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:08,400
Don't do this.

1078
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:18,140
Part of our oath is to trust each other.

1079
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:20,600
And I must abide by that promise.

1080
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:22,840
Even if you have chosen to break it.

1081
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:24,620
But heed this warning.

1082
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:28,480
The Master Emerald is guarded by a fearsome warrior.

1083
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:34,280
And to seize this ultimate power, you will have to go through him.

1084
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:36,820
Okay, wait.

1085
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:38,660
All comes down to this.

1086
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,140
The last few seconds.

1087
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:42,520
Whipple down the ice.

1088
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:43,420
He shoots.

1089
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:44,740
He scores!

1090
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:49,020
Wayne Whipple is the champion again!

1091
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:56,060
Oh, hey, Sonic.

1092
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:57,000
See my goal?

1093
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:58,260
Pretty sick, right?

1094
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,020
I'm here for the Emerald.

1095
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:01,980
Look, Sonic, I'm sorry.

1096
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:04,180
I promised to guard this Emerald with my life.

1097
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:06,020
I will do whatever it takes.

1098
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:08,140
Well, I tried.

1099
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:19,340
All right!

1100
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:25,340
This is an urgent national emergency broadcast.

1101
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:31,160
A spacecraft designed by the Agency GUN has been hijacked and launched out of the River Thames.

1102
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,500
Eggman is believed to be the culprit.

1103
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:40,180
All residents are urged to seek immediate shelter.

1104
01:16:05,570 --> 01:16:09,190
Professor, is this really what Maria would have wanted?

1105
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:15,260
The question isn't what Maria would have wanted.

1106
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:18,140
It's what do they deserve.

1107
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:21,940
Remember what you meant to us.

1108
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,540
Remember what they took from us.

1109
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:39,960
Prince, we have to go, now!

1110
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:47,380
They want to take Shadow away from us, Maria!

1111
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:56,360
Hey!

1112
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:57,100
Hey!

1113
01:16:57,340 --> 01:16:58,000
What are you doing?

1114
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:58,660
Those are children!

1115
01:16:58,900 --> 01:16:59,780
We've got an order!

1116
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:00,620
Stand down!

1117
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:27,240
Maria!

1118
01:18:14,609 --> 01:18:17,030
Excuse me, Grand Pasa Doble.

1119
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:20,230
What is that thermonuclear gerbil doing?

1120
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:24,270
Infusing the core with chaos energy.

1121
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:26,450
That's my little secret.

1122
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:32,270
The Eclipse Cannon is about to turn this planet into a flaming pile of rubble,

1123
01:18:32,830 --> 01:18:42,510
wiping out everything in a 25,000 mile radius, including us.

1124
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:47,330
What?

1125
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:51,910
We can't annihilate the Earth!

1126
01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:57,070
By combining our genius, we can rule humanity, together!

1127
01:18:57,730 --> 01:18:59,910
Humanity is a failed experiment.

1128
01:19:00,830 --> 01:19:03,050
If anyone should know that, it's you.

1129
01:19:03,730 --> 01:19:06,970
All your life, you've been rejected by this world.

1130
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:09,830
You have nothing down there.

1131
01:19:11,470 --> 01:19:13,430
No one who cares about you.

1132
01:19:15,530 --> 01:19:16,790
But I have you now.

1133
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:20,480
We're family.

1134
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:22,840
We have each other.

1135
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:25,820
Oh, Ivo.

1136
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:29,040
You're no Maria.

1137
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:36,140
I lost her, my family was gone forever!

1138
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:42,460
The only way to give Maria's life meaning is to destroy the world that took her from me.

1139
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:45,000
So I'm burning it all down!

1140
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:48,900
It's done.

1141
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:50,720
Good work, Shadow.

1142
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:53,320
I'm prepping the firing sequence.

1143
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:57,060
The weapon will be fully charged in 10 minutes.

1144
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:03,170
It's almost finished, Maria.

1145
01:20:04,030 --> 01:20:06,070
You will have justice.

1146
01:20:09,790 --> 01:20:10,310
What?

1147
01:20:10,710 --> 01:20:12,010
What is that?

1148
01:20:13,030 --> 01:20:15,470
Is Gunn launching missiles at us?

1149
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:16,770
Impossible.

1150
01:20:17,510 --> 01:20:18,710
It's moving too fast.

1151
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:23,290
It's him!

1152
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:33,810
You've hurt my family!

1153
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:35,790
This ends now!

1154
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:41,140
Fifty years!

1155
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:44,680
You've made the same choice I did.

1156
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:46,140
I'm nothing like you!

1157
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:47,380
We'll see.

1158
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:56,500
Show yourself, coward!

1159
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:29,760
One thing.

1160
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:33,480
This ends now.

1161
01:21:59,280 --> 01:21:59,920
What?

1162
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:00,300
What's happening?

1163
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:01,940
Where are they?

1164
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:03,520
Up there.

1165
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:04,140
Where?

1166
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:04,700
Higher.

1167
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,900
You left yourself open.

1168
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:08,880
Ivo!

1169
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,020
What are you doing?

1170
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:12,000
Thwarting your evil plan!

1171
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:24,080
Green!

1172
01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:25,360
Let go on three.

1173
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,120
One, two, three!

1174
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:32,880
Oh.

1175
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:35,300
A nanofist.

1176
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:39,020
I haven't seen that since I hate-watched Green Lantern in 2011.

1177
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:41,220
I was saving it for Comic-Con.

1178
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:43,660
But now there won't be a Comic-Con!

1179
01:22:56,240 --> 01:23:08,480
Where are your friends?

1180
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:12,440
They tried to stop you, didn't they?

1181
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,180
But you came anyway.

1182
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:16,480
Your anger was too much.

1183
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:21,640
What kind of hero abandons his friends to pursue revenge?

1184
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:24,080
Abandons his family?

1185
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:26,860
Don't you dare talk about my family!

1186
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:29,660
And here I thought you cared for them.

1187
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:31,660
Especially the one...

1188
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:33,060
What's his name?

1189
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:34,660
Tom?

1190
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:55,640
No!

1191
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:01,500
Go ahead!

1192
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:02,560
Finish it!

1193
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:05,740
What are you waiting for?

1194
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:06,600
Do it!

1195
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,480
I'm right here!

1196
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:12,340
You didn't let your pain change who you are.

1197
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:14,540
In here.

1198
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:24,730
This is not who I am.

1199
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:26,990
What are you doing?

1200
01:24:27,650 --> 01:24:28,350
You won!

1201
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:30,150
Take your revenge!

1202
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:34,020
There are no winners with revenge.

1203
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:50,520
Look at all those stars.

1204
01:24:56,140 --> 01:25:02,410
The last time I sat beneath stars like this, I was with her.

1205
01:25:04,490 --> 01:25:06,470
I felt this pain for so long.

1206
01:25:08,190 --> 01:25:09,590
It's all I know.

1207
01:25:10,730 --> 01:25:14,010
When I lost Longclaw, I felt the same way.

1208
01:25:16,110 --> 01:25:18,230
Did your pain eventually go away?

1209
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:19,810
No.

1210
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:24,310
But in time, I learned there's something even more powerful than pain.

1211
01:25:25,070 --> 01:25:26,930
The love we felt for each other.

1212
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:30,210
That's what you need to hold on to, Shadow.

1213
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:34,410
Maria might be gone, but your love will always remain.

1214
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:52,820
The light shines, even though the star is gone.

1215
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:06,320
This whole mess is my fault.

1216
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:11,760
I've been so blinded by rage, I thought I had no choice.

1217
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:17,320
You always have a choice.

1218
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:25,420
Making the right one is never easy.

1219
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:29,840
One more thing I learned is that when you really screw something up,

1220
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:31,880
you can't fix it on your own.

1221
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,180
Gotta go fast.

1222
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:51,200
Don't tell me you've got a catchphrase.

1223
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:52,740
That's right, new hedgehog.

1224
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,480
And everyone loves it.

1225
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:18,840
I will not try to stop my elders from destroying the world.

1226
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:26,060
Playtime is over.

1227
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:37,000
There's no going back now.

1228
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:43,420
Set up defense.

1229
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:47,120
Damn you, autocorrect.

1230
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:53,360
Mantis!

1231
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:05,660
I'm right here, Arachnerd.

1232
01:28:15,940 --> 01:28:18,820
That's what I call mantiscaping.

1233
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:21,660
That's elder abuse.

1234
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:31,260
Alert, alert, alert.

1235
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:34,760
Shadow, I see you've chosen betrayal.

1236
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,620
And you were once so useful to me.

1237
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:56,880
Are you ready to recycle some tin cans?

1238
01:28:56,980 --> 01:28:58,060
Just try to keep up.

1239
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:32,680
Please, Grandson, don't do this.

1240
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:34,180
Sorry, kiddo.

1241
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:37,620
Bringing your grandkid to work day is over.

1242
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,080
Any last words?

1243
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:51,740
Just one thing that I never thought I'd say.

1244
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:53,380
What is it?

1245
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:55,860
I love you.

1246
01:29:56,740 --> 01:29:59,820
No, it was something even better.

1247
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:02,520
But I'm not gonna say it if that's the way you're gonna be.

1248
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:04,220
Okay, bye.

1249
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:22,560
Oh, Grandchildren, all the fun and none of the responsibility.

1250
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:27,400
Who said life was pointless?

1251
01:30:29,020 --> 01:30:31,360
Oh, right, you did.

1252
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:38,520
Ah, victory!

1253
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:40,560
See what you want about my granddad?

1254
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:42,860
He made one hell of a bug zapper.

1255
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:46,920
You gotta stop that laser!

1256
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:49,480
I knew there was something I was forgetting.

1257
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:03,180
We're out of time. The cannon is about to fire.

1258
01:31:03,620 --> 01:31:04,380
Where are you?

1259
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:06,800
Uh, you know, just making friends.

1260
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:08,920
They're all yours.

1261
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:18,800
Follow me.

1262
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:27,520
Now this might hurt a little.

1263
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:43,960
So this was your plan?

1264
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:49,560
Would someone mind shutting down the giant death ray?

1265
01:31:51,580 --> 01:31:53,760
We can't stop the cannon from firing.

1266
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:56,080
But we can steer it away from the Earth.

1267
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:57,520
Coming around the starboard.

1268
01:31:57,700 --> 01:31:58,420
Aye, aye, doc.

1269
01:31:58,420 --> 01:31:59,120
Yes!

1270
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:04,060
Here we go.

1271
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,640
It's a little tight.

1272
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:10,440
Definitely not power steering.

1273
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:18,460
Keep turning.

1274
01:32:21,460 --> 01:32:23,660
Jump at any time. Here goes.

1275
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:33,020
Can't hold much longer.

1276
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:53,920
Yes! I did it! I did it!

1277
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:00,800
Look what you did!

1278
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:02,440
Hey, look down there!

1279
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:03,420
Sonny!

1280
01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:13,030
Lost one.

1281
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:48,300
Really? What's happening?

1282
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:50,400
The reactor core is overloading.

1283
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:53,440
It's only a matter of time before it blows.

1284
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:55,640
So what does that mean for Earth?

1285
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:57,820
A radioactive atmosphere?

1286
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:01,020
Rain that kills the crops and melts your flesh?

1287
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:02,820
Other than that...

1288
01:34:02,820 --> 01:34:04,080
We're not done here.

1289
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,480
You try to stabilize the reactor.

1290
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:07,820
Buy me some time.

1291
01:34:08,220 --> 01:34:11,380
I'll push the station away from Earth before it explodes.

1292
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:15,960
This is our last chance to do the right thing.

1293
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,060
Core integrity failing.

1294
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:35,320
Oh, no!

1295
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:36,560
I'm sorry, Sonny!

1296
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:36,740
Dad!

1297
01:35:40,290 --> 01:35:41,530
Agent Stone!

1298
01:35:42,370 --> 01:35:44,050
No, no! Doctor, wait!

1299
01:35:44,350 --> 01:35:46,250
If I can't rule the world,

1300
01:35:47,550 --> 01:35:49,190
I might as well save it!

1301
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:56,880
Stone, you...

1302
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:13,620
I'll miss your lattes with keen doctrine.

1303
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:32,820
Sonic, look!

1304
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:44,580
Shadow and Robotnik,

1305
01:37:44,860 --> 01:37:48,480
they sacrificed themselves to save everyone.

1306
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:51,360
You always have a choice.

1307
01:37:53,990 --> 01:37:55,890
I'm really sorry for running off like that.

1308
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:57,430
I shouldn't have left you behind.

1309
01:37:59,530 --> 01:38:00,170
The truth is,

1310
01:38:01,090 --> 01:38:03,910
you're the best teammates a hedgehog could ever ask for.

1311
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:08,920
Can you ever forgive me?

1312
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:14,500
Team Sonic.

1313
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:48,720
Big finish.

1314
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:53,860
Now that's what I call teamwork.

1315
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:00,680
How could you?

1316
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:01,880
Gotta be mad!

1317
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:04,620
Give me a break.

1318
01:39:05,220 --> 01:39:06,800
I'm a little slow over here.

1319
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:07,280
Donut!

1320
01:39:10,180 --> 01:39:12,840
I am having the lunch.

1321
01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:23,420
And nothing is gonna stand in our way.

1322
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:28,580
That one piece of unfinished business.

1323
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:47,440
Let's do this!

1324
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:48,240
Yeah!
