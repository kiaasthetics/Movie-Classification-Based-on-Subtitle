1
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,858
Walter, have you seen
my tweezers?

2
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,459
Um, sorry.
Did you need that mug?

3
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,174
I needed that coffee.

4
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,388
So...

5
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,931
Unitee.
...what you making, bud?

6
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,010
A gadget for you

7
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,432
to wear on patrol.
Oh.

8
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,805
It's the perfect tool
to keep you safe.

9
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,644
This button
makes a really loud sound

10
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,268
to incapacitate
your enemies.

11
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:52,862
Like that.

12
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,146
This one can wrap you
in an inflatable hug

13
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,901
so no one can hurt you.
A-ha.

14
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,776
And this one is for when
you're outnumbered.

15
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,569
You just hold out your hand
and say, "Stop!"

16
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,033
And boom!

17
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,617
Glitter cloud!

18
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,912
And the bad guys
will leave you alone.

19
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:11,336
Oh! Because glitter makes
people happy?

20
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,791
Because the refracted light

21
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,373
causes the
enterochromaffin cells

22
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,174
to release serotonin.

23
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,012
Yeah, glitter makes
people happy.

24
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,052
Let's try it out.

25
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,261
Remember how you told me

26
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:25,673
not to take apart
your cell phone?

27
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,303
Walter Beckett,
you took apart my...

28
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,732
Still wanna kill me?

29
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,145
No. Just the opposite.

30
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,323
Then it works!

31
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,197
I also wanna add
some kitten visuals

32
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,115
to trigger
the orbitofrontal cortex.

33
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,263
11-A-25,

34
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,823
Code Six, 104 North.

35
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,997
Hon, I gotta go.

36
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,165
Time for my shift.

37
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,074
Be good for Gram, okay?

38
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,663
Uh, I'll come
with you.

39
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,077
I can finish this
on the way.

40
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,916
You won't even
know I'm there.

41
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:58,258
What you need to do
is get ready for school.

42
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,840
Oh, Mom,
school's boring.

43
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,255
And the kids
think I'm weird.

44
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,433
Weird?

45
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,925
Hey, look at me.

46
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,468
What's wrong with weird?

47
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,102
The world needs weird.

48
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:13,686
Listen, I'm out there
keeping the neighborhood safe.

49
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:17,645
But one day, your ideas...

50
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,654
your gadgets...

51
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,361
are gonna keep
the world safe.

52
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:27,738
And everybody will wish
they were as weird as you.

53
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,750
You think?

54
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,950
I know.

55
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,379
Now, give me
a non-inflatable hug.

56
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,502
Love you, partner.

57
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,343
I promise
I'll always have your back.

58
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,514
Team Weird?

59
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,474
Team Weird.

60
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,747
Man, it's cold!

61
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,295
Hey, fellas.

62
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,278
Special Agent Lance Sterling.

63
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,302
How you livin'?

64
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,840
Whoa, okay, okay.

65
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:26,557
Everybody good?

66
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,218
I'm just gonna
take his gun

67
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,800
and I'm gonna toss it
to that snowman.

68
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,931
And while you're both looking
all confused,

69
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,291
trying to figure out
what's going on...

70
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,306
- I'm just gonna knock you out.
- Huh?

71
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,605
Ugh.

72
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,984
He didn't deserve that.

73
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,275
Rats with wings.

74
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,241
I'm in position.

75
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,828
What is your situation?

76
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,790
Just getting a visual...

77
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,169
now.

78
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:06,970
10 o'clock.

79
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,052
Katsu Kimura.

80
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,091
Everybody's favorite
arms dealer.

81
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,851
There.
That briefcase is your objective.

82
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,058
Inside is the M9 Assassin.

83
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,269
The first semi-autonomous
attack drone,

84
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,975
powered by
atmospheric energy.

85
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,477
Never shuts down,

86
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,277
never stops pursuing
its target.

87
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,072
They stole it
from our covert weapons lab.

88
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,774
Uh, Director Jenkins,

89
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:28,949
he's got incoming.

90
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,237
Detecting 70 extra hostiles
around the perimeter.

91
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,914
I don't want
another mess like Kyrgyzstan.

92
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,747
Lance, listen to me.
You've got 70 yakuza incoming.

93
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,081
Stand down.

94
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,275
That's better odds
than I usually get.

95
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,789
No! Do not engage.

96
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,848
This time, you need to wait
for the backup team.

97
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,710
Team?

98
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:48,848
I fly solo.

99
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,695
Wait. Lance, listen to...

100
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,719
I think he cut off...

101
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:56,932
I get it!
Yeah, great,

102
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,292
that's right. Sorry.

103
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,208
The buyer is here. Go!

104
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,331
Huh.

105
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,117
Uh-oh.

106
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,905
Guess it's time
to introduce myself.

107
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,829
Huh?

108
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,440
You know
how you can tell

109
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,063
when you're the world's
greatest spy?

110
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,486
Sterling.

111
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,147
Lance Sterling.

112
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,815
Everyone knows the name.

113
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,577
I'mma need that case.

114
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:36,870
Over my dead body.

115
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:47,126
Just 3 ounces of pressure
to the vagus nerve...

116
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,790
and then look at your boy.

117
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,254
Sleepy night-night.

118
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,210
Hey, you mind
giving me a hand?

119
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,050
Hey, come on.

120
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,638
What was it?
The hand joke?

121
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,439
You don't remember me,
do you?

122
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,654
What can I say?
I meet a lot of bad guys.

123
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:21,202
I'm gonna show you pain
that you can't imagine.

124
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,556
Make it hurt.

125
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,977
I don't think
that subtitle was in my favor.

126
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,435
Okay. Oh, okay.

127
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,356
You wanna do it the hard way?
Let's go, then.

128
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,899
Let's do it
the hard way.

129
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,539
It's about to get messy.

130
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,335
Aw.

131
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,337
What the...

132
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,029
Ooh.

133
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,204
Hey, don't take
the loss so hard.

134
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,299
I mean,
you did great.

135
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,832
And you got to meet
Lance Sterling.

136
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,324
Next. Okay,
put everything in the bin.

137
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,999
Yes, come through.

138
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,373
- Oh! He's coming.
- Wow. Here he comes!

139
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,670
Yes,

140
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,957
your eyes
aren't deceiving you.

141
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,207
Yep, it's him.

142
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:41,385
Thank you, thank you.

143
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,780
Looking good,
Agent Sterling!

144
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,340
Hey, not looking
so bad yourself.

145
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,242
Thank you. Thank you.

146
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,946
Yeah, you know what?
Go ahead back to work.

147
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,723
Go ahead back to work.
It's too much.

148
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:51,930
It's probably
the right amount.

149
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,123
But still go back to work.

150
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,147
Still go back to work.

151
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,768
You're so crazy.

152
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,233
What's up, Sterling?

153
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,358
Lucas!

154
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,480
My name's Dave.

155
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,112
There you go.
Good to see you.

156
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,408
Morning, sir.

157
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,857
Fellas, give it to me.

158
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,242
Dude, did you see that?
Never wash that hand again.

159
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,779
I feel stronger.
Like, I legit feel stronger.

160
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,117
Can I hold it?
Yeah.

161
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,395
Dude from Accounting.
Thanks for the win, Sterling.

162
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,375
Keep my money right.
Keep my money right.

163
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:17,581
Go ahead, man.
All right.

164
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,857
Hey,
welcome back, Lance.

165
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:19,916
Thank you,
thank you.

166
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,965
Aw, he's the most
adorable agent ever!

167
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,339
Somebody gonna get it.

168
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,282
Oh! Agent Sterling.

169
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,544
Walter Beckett.

170
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,734
Weirdo.

171
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,153
Unitee loves you.

172
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,217
All right, Unitee.

173
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,130
Imagine...

174
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:11,298
a hydrothermal explosion is
about to melt your face off.

175
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,559
But what's this?

176
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,888
A gadget that can surround you
in a pressurized pocket

177
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,139
of safety?

178
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,600
"Can it work?"
It hasn't yet, but maybe.

179
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,752
Here we go.

180
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,687
Session number nine,
test 30... Oh!

181
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,810
Oh, hey, Terrance.

182
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,229
Tonight's the season finale
of Hearts in Seoul.

183
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,442
I sent you an e-vite.

184
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,448
I, uh...

185
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,200
You just click "accept"
in your...

186
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:32,948
Agent Sterling.

187
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,913
Uh... Hi, wow.
Uh, Walter Beckett.

188
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:37,084
Pleasure to meet...

189
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,158
Aw.

190
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,330
You used it.

191
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,336
You touched my stuff.

192
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,916
Okay, okay. Look, I know
it's non-traditional, but...

193
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:47,129
Feel me here, little man.

194
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,543
So, I'm out there...

195
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,970
and I'm saving the world,
doing big things.

196
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,220
That's what I do.
Mmm-hmm.

197
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,973
And the way I do it...

198
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,929
is to have my things

199
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,511
do the things
I expect my things to do.

200
00:14:58,689 --> 00:14:59,804
Yep. Ow.

201
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:02,353
Like blow stuff up.

202
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,270
See, out there...

203
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,687
I gotta fight
fire with fire.

204
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:11,153
Because if I try to fight
fire with glitter...

205
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:15,119
I could get my face
burned off.

206
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,825
But you didn't.

207
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,452
Because the kitty glitter
worked.

208
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,832
Kitty litter?
Glitter.

209
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,617
Kitty glitter.

210
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,796
It's scientifically proven
that watching kittens...

211
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,788
causes the
enterochromaffin cells

212
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:26,883
to release serotonin.

213
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,755
Glitter makes people happy.

214
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,258
Know what works
even better?

215
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,010
A grenade.

216
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,799
It's kinda violent,
don't you think?

217
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,809
Can't save the world
with a hug, Wilson.

218
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,727
It's Walter.

219
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,513
And what if you could?

220
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,307
The inflatable hug.

221
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:49,567
Kind of a personal protection
device I've been developing.

222
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:02,250
This is a vile
waste of taxpayer dollars.

223
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,421
Look, I'm just saying
you can do more

224
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,044
by bringing
people together...

225
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,298
than blowing them up.

226
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,051
And if I can
convince you,

227
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,003
we can convince
the whole agency.

228
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,547
There is no "we."

229
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:16,765
Uh, Agent Sterling.
Just...

230
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,595
Okay. Okay, okay.
Millennials.

231
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,205
No, wait, wait, wait.
Please don't close that door.

232
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,229
Not interested.

233
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,416
Listen, you gotta
hear me out.

234
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,896
Whatever it is, no.

235
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,188
Phew. Look,
I've been working

236
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,381
on this thing
at home, right...

237
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,147
that is gonna change
spying forever.

238
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,075
Imagine...

239
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,108
if I could make you,
wait for it...

240
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,527
drumroll, please...

241
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,413
disappear.

242
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,791
Disappear?

243
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:42,876
Yeah.

244
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,541
Disappear.

245
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,661
Why are you saying it
like that?

246
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,672
For effect.

247
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,008
I'm totally
excited about it.

248
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,214
It's called

249
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,216
bio-dynamic concealment.

250
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,005
Boom. Mic drop.

251
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,011
Huh? Conceal this?

252
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,123
I mean, you wouldn't
need a bulletproof suit.

253
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,625
You wouldn't need
exploding cufflinks.

254
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,264
You could
blend in anywhere.

255
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,228
What if you were totally...

256
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,735
...invisible?

257
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,606
Wow. Dude.

258
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,274
That's a mess.

259
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,196
Don't worry yourself.

260
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,202
The effects,
they're only temporary.

261
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,659
All right, cool, cool.
I'm gonna get outta here.

262
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,039
Wait, wait, wait.

263
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,161
Look, you're
the world's greatest spy.

264
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,997
Nobody ever listens
to my ideas

265
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,832
or gives me a chance...

266
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,750
but if you did...

267
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,179
together...

268
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,884
we could really
make a difference.

269
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:41,970
"Make a difference"?

270
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:45,011
Boy, I am the difference.

271
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:48,556
All I need from you
is when I want a grenade...

272
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,270
make me a grenade.

273
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:51,695
Can you do that?

274
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,479
There's a better way.

275
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,615
Wrong answer, Willy.

276
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,408
You're fired.

277
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,910
What? Wait.

278
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,321
No, no, no.
Uh, please don't fire me!

279
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:11,879
Weirdo.

280
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,384
Mission accomplished.

281
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:20,638
Oh, man, I'm telling you,
it was one of my best.

282
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,205
I was on fire.

283
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:26,264
Fighting, explosions,
tons of witty catchphrases.

284
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,355
Lance?

285
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,307
I had to jump
through a helicopter.

286
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,484
Lance?

287
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:34,644
- Right?
- Lance!

288
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,320
Hmm?
Please tell me

289
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:39,069
you have an explanation
for why this is empty.

290
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,870
I know why.

291
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:43,862
Because he stole it.

292
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,200
Excuse me?

293
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,535
Agent Marcy Kappel,
Internal Affairs.

294
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,325
Mind if my team
sweeps the room?

295
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,583
Yes, I mind.

296
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:51,870
They call me Eyes.

297
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,710
Spectral analysis and quantum
optical thermography.

298
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,715
Ears. Sound.

299
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,053
Okay.

300
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,844
Hey, y'all need to ease out
of my face right now.

301
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:02,464
Whoa! Hey.

302
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,799
Weapons deactivated.
Backing up.

303
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,558
Take Agent Sterling
into custody.

304
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,185
All right, enough!

305
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:11,063
We're talking about
my top agent here.

306
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,723
I trust this man.

307
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:17,228
The only thing we can trust
is the facts.

308
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,323
Eyes?

309
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,572
A surveillance camera
in Tokyo

310
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,380
picked this up two hours
after your mission.

311
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,236
Stop right there.

312
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,839
Lance?
Joy.

313
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,220
His heart rate
just spiked.

314
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:44,597
That's because
it isn't me.

315
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,257
Vocal patterns
is all off the hook.

316
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,515
This has to be wrong.

317
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,013
This is wrong!
I didn't...

318
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,639
Look, there was a guy
with a robot hand.

319
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,182
He stole the Assassin,

320
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,016
and he scanned my face
to frame me.

321
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,985
That sounds plausible,

322
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,778
and not like something
you just made up.

323
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,359
Sounds a little
Scooby-Doo, bro.

324
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,534
It isn't me!

325
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,574
Okay, so,
just to be clear...

326
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:08,033
there's a man with a robot
hand and Lance's face

327
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,072
who took the M9 Assassin.

328
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,366
We all feel good
about that?

329
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,041
Okay, case closed.
Let's go home.

330
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,296
You know what?

331
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,538
There's a bad guy

332
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,997
who needs
to be stopped.

333
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,423
Couldn't agree more.

334
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,467
Huh. You're good.

335
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,754
Lance, just cooperate.

336
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,672
Didn't see that coming,
did you?

337
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:28,307
Did you see that coming?

338
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,684
He's running.
Why do they always run?

339
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,398
Off to save
the world again?

340
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,899
Uh, yeah, you, too.
You, too.

341
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,107
'Sup, Sterling?
All good, all good.

342
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,775
Sorry.

343
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,659
Sterling!

344
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,789
Now.

345
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,059
Northwest corner.

346
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,083
Got him.

347
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:58,957
Coming through,
coming through.

348
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,629
Security!

349
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,178
Shut this place down!

350
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,348
Agent Sterling?

351
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,548
I would do what she says.

352
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,637
She is very unpleasant.

353
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,900
Agent Sterling!
What's happening, man?

354
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,235
I was just telling the guys
about the time you...

355
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,042
All right, Sterling.

356
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:25,795
Think.

357
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,380
Think.

358
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:31,639
Somebody else knows
about Robot Hand.

359
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,178
Who?

360
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:38,398
Kimura.

361
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,981
Find Kimura.

362
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,400
Tracking Katsu Kimura.

363
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:46,779
Wireless signal intercepted
in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico.

364
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:47,946
You shouldn't be
calling me.

365
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:48,992
Mexico.

366
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,156
I'm trying to lay low!

367
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,279
I need to disappear.

368
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,704
Disappear.

369
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,630
Bingo.

370
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,665
Hope you got
your pants on, Wilbur.

371
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,643
Unitee.

372
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,655
I miss you, Mom.

373
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,275
See, Lovey?

374
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,190
Some dreams do come true.

375
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,866
Oh, um...

376
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:18,537
Okay.

377
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,296
Commencing bio-dynamic
concealment

378
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:37,723
test number 83,
batch five.

379
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,519
Exothermic reaction.

380
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,805
That's an exothermic reaction.

381
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,687
Uh, Lovey, could I borrow
a feather, please?

382
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,268
Thank you.

383
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:50,975
Here's a little something
for you.

384
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,449
If this works,

385
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,372
they'll have to
give me my job back.

386
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,671
No way. It worked.

387
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,548
It worked.

388
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:17,054
It worked! It worked!
It worked!

389
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,304
Lovey, it worked!
It worked!

390
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,475
I need to disappear.

391
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:23,790
What... How did you...

392
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,417
What are you doing in my...

393
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:26,561
What's up?

394
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,608
Okay, listen.

395
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,562
That next-generation
concealment tech

396
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,922
you were
talking about earlier...

397
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,528
you wouldn't happen to have
it on hand, would you?

398
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:36,361
Actually, I do happen
to have it in hand.

399
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,366
Show it to me.
Sure. Um...

400
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:39,739
Well, can I
offer you a drink?

401
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:40,872
I got water,

402
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,492
Soylent drinkable
meal replacement...

403
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,539
Mmm. Good.
We had a drink.

404
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,062
So, what are we
talking about here?

405
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,576
Light-bending
camo suit?

406
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,591
Adaptive response silicon...

407
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,206
Diet stuff
has a weird aftertaste.

408
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,464
What's the tech?

409
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:57,303
Um... Well,
you just drank it.

410
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:59,054
Drank what?
The tech.

411
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,306
Now it's gone. Yep.

412
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,224
Why do you have
a pigeon in here?

413
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,807
Yeah, okay, that's just Lovey.
She's my roommate.

414
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,709
How am I gonna do this?
Um, that's weird.

415
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:08,768
This is bad.
No, it's not.

416
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:09,919
To have a pigeon
in your house.

417
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:10,943
It's amazing.

418
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,814
It's science.
Here we go.

419
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,944
You just drank
an ingestible formula

420
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:16,632
that uses a CRISPR-Cas9
genetic editor...

421
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,778
to resequence your DNA
on a molecular level.

422
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,992
Science rocks.

423
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:24,196
Wow! Okay, here's
what I need you to do.

424
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,365
Pretend like
you're a normal person

425
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,667
talking to a much cooler
normal person.

426
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:31,583
In precisely 45 seconds,

427
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,334
you will transform into...

428
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:34,967
a pigeon.

429
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,104
I'm out.

430
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:47,762
Wait, wait, wait.

431
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,146
What you're about
to experience

432
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,543
is the future
of espionage.

433
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:51,602
Okay.

434
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,651
You might be experiencing
some mild discomfort.

435
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,486
Or severe.

436
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,468
I'll make a note of that.

437
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:00,153
This is because
I fired you, right?

438
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:03,201
Okay, I'm gonna walk
outta here.

439
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:04,703
Yeah, that might be hard.

440
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:08,161
Because you're in the middle
of chromothripsis.

441
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,284
Okay, might pass out.

442
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,957
Oh, you're definitely
gonna pass out.

443
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,373
Your genomes
are being smashed apart...

444
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,587
so they can be reassembled
with pigeon DNA.

445
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,839
Muscle it down, Lance.

446
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:21,674
Muscle it down.

447
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,723
Oh! What did you do?
What did you do?

448
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:26,638
Whoa.
You're entering Phase Two.

449
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:29,098
Epigenetic modulation.

450
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,725
Think of each gene
as having a switch.

451
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,356
And one by one, your switches
are flipping to pigeon.

452
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:36,060
Human-pigeon, human-pigeon,
human-pigeon.

453
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,729
Human-pigeon,
human-pigeon, human-pigeon.

454
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,898
Stop with the lights!

455
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,691
Wait, look at my hand!

456
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:46,078
What's happening
to my hand?

457
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,321
Baby hand.

458
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,615
This is the final phase!

459
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,831
This isn't so bad.

460
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,820
Your body is
being flooded with endorphins

461
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,564
to prepare you
for the immense physical pain

462
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,211
you're about to experience.

463
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,755
Wait. Say that again.

464
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:09,809
You poisoned me!

465
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:11,314
"Poisoned"?

466
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,142
That's not even
my department.

467
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:14,978
Squeeze the poison out.

468
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:18,571
I wouldn't do that.

469
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,675
Three seconds.

470
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,530
You're gonna be fine.
Trust me.

471
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,525
Here we go.

472
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,244
Hmm?

473
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:30,535
Ha!
What?

474
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,997
Whoa. That clock's fast.

475
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,585
Lance?

476
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,386
Lance.

477
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,055
It worked.

478
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:45,929
Subject's vitals are stable.

479
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:49,136
Inserting rectal thermometer.

480
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,433
It's okay, buddy.

481
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,432
Hey, it's okay.
Don't you worry.

482
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,147
Your good friend Walter
is here.

483
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,987
Subject appears disoriented.

484
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,614
Of course I'm disoriented.

485
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:13,793
You can talk?

486
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,204
Lovey, he can talk!

487
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:16,414
It worked.
My eyes!

488
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:17,607
It worked.
Can you believe this?

489
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:18,691
What did you do
to my eyes?

490
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,075
Hey, Lance, look at me.
What did...

491
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,460
Look at you?

492
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:24,172
I can't not
look at you, Walter.

493
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:27,759
I can see my butt and your
face at the same time!

494
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,264
That is so cool!

495
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,846
Fact, pigeons have
360-degree vision.

496
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:33,643
Now, nobody can sneak up
behind you.

497
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:35,614
- Stop, girl. Come on.
- This is so great.

498
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,481
Pigeons can be found in every
major city around the world...

499
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:39,767
and no one notices them.

500
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,936
It's the most perfect form
a spy could take.

501
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,730
You better un-bird me right now.

502
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,990
That's it. I'm not playing
with you. Un-bird...

503
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,160
I'm raising my voice.

504
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,444
I probably shouldn't be
raising my voice at you.

505
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,828
I guess you could imagine

506
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,155
I'm a little stressed
right now.

507
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,081
I need you
to un-bird me, Walter.

508
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,537
Mmm-hmm.
Of course.

509
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,231
I'll start working
on an antidote right now.

510
00:29:58,255 --> 00:29:59,290
Start?

511
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,984
Well, the formula was purely
theoretical until you...

512
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:03,545
You're gonna start?
You don't have an antidote?

513
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,334
Stop, girl, seriously.

514
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,627
Okay, okay.

515
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,262
So, you birded me,
and you can't un-bird me.

516
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:12,095
Technically, you kind of
birded yourself.

517
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:13,926
I'mma hurt this boy.

518
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,164
- I'mma hurt this boy.
- No, no, look.

519
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,868
I know you're upset,
but everything's okay.

520
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,584
I called the Agency
and told them you're here.

521
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:19,688
You did what?

522
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,811
No, no, no, it's okay.

523
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:21,963
I didn't tell them
you're a bird.

524
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,147
Although I think
they're gonna

525
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,857
figure that out
pretty quickly.

526
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,529
I gotta ghost.

527
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:32,286
Yeah, there may be one or two
downsides to your new form.

528
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:35,163
Webster, open the door.

529
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,915
Okay. Okay.

530
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,160
What... Why are you running
from the Agency?

531
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,329
Get off me! I'm running...

532
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,713
because there's a bad guy
out there with my face...

533
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,249
and now I have to try
to stop him

534
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,551
from hurting people
while being a bird.

535
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:50,007
And thank you for that.
Thank you very much for that.

536
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,298
You know what?
You're fired again.

537
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:53,768
Double fired!

538
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,680
Mmm, I don't think
that's a thing.

539
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:58,012
Oh, it's a thing.
It's a thing now.

540
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,062
Okay.

541
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:08,697
It's a wingsuit.

542
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,027
How hard could it be?

543
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,777
Time to fly.

544
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:17,493
Nope.

545
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,908
You broke into the Kremlin
using a napkin

546
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,413
and a piece of duct tape.

547
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:25,456
You should be able
to get into your own car!

548
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:33,593
Yep, yep, yep.

549
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:38,101
Got it, got it,
got it... Ow!

550
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:39,397
Come on.

551
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,735
Okay,
hear me out.

552
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,217
Is somebody talking?
I don't hear anybody talking.

553
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,232
Especially somebody
that's been double fired...

554
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,695
working on a triple fire.

555
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:53,869
I'll come with you.

556
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,077
I can show you all the
advantages of being a pigeon

557
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:58,364
and how it can make you
an even better spy.

558
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,328
And then you'll give me
my job back.

559
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:01,537
We both win.

560
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,789
All right,
let me think about that.

561
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,087
No.

562
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,165
Okay. Well, I suppose
you have somebody else

563
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,340
who has a mobile lab...

564
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,918
who could turn you back
into a man.

565
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,593
Get in the car. You won't
even know I'm here.

566
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:25,674
I'll just ride out here,
don't worry.

567
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,642
Oh, right. My bad.

568
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,271
Go, go, go!
Moving through.

569
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,526
I want that tree gone, now!

570
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:33,886
Agent Sterling,

571
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,990
exit the premises now!

572
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:36,868
What are you doing?
Get in the car!

573
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,224
Holy...

574
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:39,863
Wilfred! Let's move!

575
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,372
Let's go, go, go!

576
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,000
Activate auto-drive.

577
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:45,581
Auto-drive engaged.

578
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,495
Sterling private jet hangar.

579
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,126
See that, Walter?

580
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:50,791
You can bird me...

581
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,550
but you can't stop me.

582
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,006
He was behind us.

583
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,386
Buckle up. And get me

584
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,059
everything we can
on that Beckett kid.

585
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,582
You think
they're working together?

586
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:05,018
Sterling works alone.
He's using him for something.

587
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,483
You brought the lady bird?

588
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,398
She's my emotional
support animal.

589
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:18,193
You're gonna need
a life support animal

590
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:19,573
if that bird poop in my...

591
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,780
We got company.

592
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,120
We've got units
blocking every street,

593
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:26,452
overpass, and exit
within a 5-mile radius.

594
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,087
Perfect.
Time for a cattle drive.

595
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,337
Saddle up!

596
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:34,062
Evasive maneuvers activated.

597
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:41,182
I don't have
time for this.

598
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:42,478
Activate weapons.
What?

599
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:43,915
- Activating weapons.
- Relax.

600
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,429
I'm just gonna
take out her tires.

601
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,351
Uh, that's really bad.

602
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,682
I dare you.

603
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:49,879
Deactivating weapons.

604
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:50,963
No,
we're the good guys.

605
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,727
We can't shoot
the other good guys.

606
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:53,986
Yeah, you're right, Walter.

607
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,301
Let's just pull over
and talk it out.

608
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:56,565
Exactly. Can we?

609
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,233
Activate weapons.
Activating weapons.

610
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,447
Deactivate weapons.
Deactivating weapons.

611
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,266
How about something
non-lethal like oil slick?

612
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,290
Activate weapons.

613
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,455
Deactivate weapons.

614
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,354
Don't listen to Walter.
Activate weapons.

615
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:07,458
Oil slick.
Activate weapons.

616
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:10,044
Oil slick! Oil slick!
Oil slick!

617
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,914
This man trippin'.

618
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:14,799
Oil slick! Oil slick!
Oil slick!

619
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:16,906
Deactivate.

620
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,770
System shut down. Goodbye.

621
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:21,052
Oh, what did you do?

622
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,232
He's like a god
of the asphalt.

623
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:32,609
We'll see about that.

624
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,427
All right, all right.
I got this. I got this.

625
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,451
I got this. I got this.

626
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:40,696
We're gonna die!

627
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,656
Oh, no.
Watch out!

628
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,212
We should be coming
up on him any second.

629
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:02,722
This ends now.

630
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:03,892
Is everyone in position?

631
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,300
Affirmative.
In position.

632
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,268
Walter, get that computer
back online.

633
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:08,499
Systems coming back online.

634
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,293
Defensive applications online.

635
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:11,317
Oil slick?
Fine,

636
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,443
whatever! Just press it!

637
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:14,839
Wait!
We're driving backwards.

638
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,048
We're driving backwards.

639
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:45,719
No!

640
00:35:58,323 --> 00:35:59,608
That was tight.

641
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:02,115
Yep. It's official.
I'm a fan.

642
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,698
Did anyone else see a
pigeon in that car?

643
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,913
Auto-drive engaged.

644
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:14,123
I can't help but feel like
some of this is my fault.

645
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:17,585
Some? Joker,
this is all your fault.

646
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,750
Airstrip. Now.

647
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:20,928
I'm sorry. Jeez.

648
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,836
Didn't mean to ruffle
your feathers.

649
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,546
I hate you.

650
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,565
Lovey, this is the opportunity
we've been waiting for.

651
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:46,109
There are so many gadgets
I wanna test in the field.

652
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,152
We got the binder bubbles,
collide-oscope,

653
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,284
hypno-stars,
blamethrower, snorepedo.

654
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,493
We've got the multi-pen.

655
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,479
We haven't even tried the
multi-pen in the...

656
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,334
I'm gonna need
a code name.

657
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:58,497
Bond. Hydrogen Bond.

658
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,673
Oh, no, where is it?

659
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,254
Wait! What is that?

660
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,630
What is that?

661
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:06,137
Oh! No, no.
Fly, fly, fly!

662
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,646
Hey, everything go okay
in there?

663
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:26,658
I just found out that
number one and number two...

664
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:29,319
both come out
of the same place.

665
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,113
So, no.
Things are not okay.

666
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:34,533
Yeah. It's called
a cloaca.

667
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,417
It sounds weird and gross,

668
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,869
but having a cloaca
just means...

669
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,162
Dude!

670
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,205
I know what it means.

671
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,999
Saw it in the mirror.

672
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,961
I know you're not
in a good place right now...

673
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:49,051
but there are benefits
to being a pigeon.

674
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,511
Okay, so read
what used to be my lips.

675
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,551
You're only here,
because A,

676
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,932
I can't work a touchscreen
enough to eject you...

677
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,565
and B, you're supposed to be
working on something, correct?

678
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:01,814
Oh, the antidote.
Right. Sure.

679
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,650
Yeah, that's going to take
18 hours to render.

680
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:07,987
I'm stuck like this,
with this body, for 18...

681
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,610
Ooh, boy...

682
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:13,367
Whoo! Okay,
walk this one off.

683
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:27,260
You know,
being a pigeon

684
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:29,929
is actually way cooler
than it seems.

685
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,594
And if you just embrace
your new form,

686
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,471
you'll see
all the advantages.

687
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:37,058
Like, fact,
did you know

688
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,309
that pigeons can see
in slow motion?

689
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:40,811
Because, fact,
pigeons can fly

690
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:43,359
up to 92.7 miles
per hour.

691
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,770
And, fact, pigeons are

692
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,675
highly intelligent animals
who like to play games.

693
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:47,699
Oh, and, fact...

694
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,404
Fact! You should have kept
your seat belt on.

695
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:51,787
Whoo!

696
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:57,949
Fact, pigeons can see
ultraviolet light...

697
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,583
which is a broad
spectrum of light

698
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:00,877
the human eye
can't even see.

699
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,878
Fact, pigeons are
a flock animal,

700
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:04,235
which makes it easier
for them to...

701
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:21,397
All right, Kimura,
I'm coming for you.

702
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:24,025
Lance Sterling
is on the scene.

703
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,402
And Bond.
Hydrogen Bond.

704
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,399
Dude, you need medicine.

705
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:36,700
Go, go, go!
Hey!

706
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,060
You just pushed me.

707
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,496
All right, y'all better squad
up, cause here comes the...

708
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,786
Hey! Did you just
toe-poke me?

709
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:46,206
You're a pigeon.
You can walk right past them.

710
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,378
Oh. Huh.

711
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,004
Just a regular old bird.

712
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:56,599
Uh, that's not
a pigeon sound.

713
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,179
Till you grow a cloaca,

714
00:39:58,271 --> 00:39:59,727
I decide
what the bird sounds are.

715
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,686
They're so stupid.

716
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:06,351
You see, it's like
you're invisible.

717
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:07,481
All right.

718
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,198
Your room key, sir.

719
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:18,332
Bingo.

720
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,532
Okay, let's figure this out.
You and me. Let's go.

721
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,292
Let's brainstorm.
How we gonna find this nut?

722
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:26,086
Uh, you are gonna
sit down right here

723
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,664
on this very nice couch.

724
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:28,842
But I'm your wingman.

725
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,797
Ooh, you know who needs
a wingman? That couch.

726
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,428
Go sit your narrow behind down
and do some science stuff...

727
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,215
and I'mma go find Kimura.
Alone.

728
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:41,181
Oh, what is that
heavenly smell?

729
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:42,471
Mmm.

730
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:44,890
Oh, no.

731
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:46,774
Do not do it, Lance.

732
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:47,976
Oh...

733
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,361
Mmm. Lance!
Have some dignity.

734
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,323
Walter, what is happening?

735
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:57,110
It must be some sort of latent
avian instincts kicking in.

736
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,074
Why am I eating food
off of the ground?

737
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,036
Why does it taste amazing?

738
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,585
Ugh. No, I'm good.
Thank you.

739
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:07,916
Oh, wow.

740
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,173
My dude, seriously,
give me 10 feet.

741
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:13,255
Hey, no, human feet.
Back up.

742
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,091
Oh, no.
I wish I could unsee that.

743
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,301
This is huge. They've made
you part of their flock.

744
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,276
I'm not trying to be
a part of nobody's flock.

745
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:22,560
Shoo! Back up, fanboy.

746
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,721
I don't care that your name is Jeff.
Beat it.

747
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:25,816
You can understand them?

748
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,935
What? No, no!

749
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,629
Does Lovey really love me?
I'm not hearing bird-talk.

750
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:29,797
Am I her best friend?

751
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,061
None of this is right!

752
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,399
Nice to meet you, Jeff.

753
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:33,858
Stop talking to Jeff!

754
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,486
Ugh.

755
00:41:57,098 --> 00:42:00,932
All right, what alias
are you using, Kimura?

756
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,437
"Not Kimura."

757
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,017
Wow. That's clever.

758
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,812
I am way too good at this.

759
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,815
Oh, come on.

760
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:19,279
Seriously, fellas.
Not now.

761
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,286
This is so humiliating.

762
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,414
Hey, I'm not for the games.

763
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:27,784
You better not...
Mmm-mmm.

764
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:29,838
Stop it.

765
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,289
Stop it! Stop!

766
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,470
No!

767
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,590
Stop it!
What is wrong with you?

768
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,134
Oh.

769
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,916
Well, would you look at that?
Being in a flock helped you.

770
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,247
Not my flock!

771
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,421
Lance...

772
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:12,874
Lance.

773
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:14,049
Wait, wait, wait. Uh...

774
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:16,208
You should not
go up there alone.

775
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,091
Maybe I have something else
that can help.

776
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:22,346
Walter, I do not need
your help.

777
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:23,723
Never will.

778
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:28,227
Can you push "20"
for me, please?

779
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,416
I thought
you didn't need any help.

780
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,475
I don't.

781
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:31,710
Feels like helping.
Nope.

782
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:32,878
Yeah, a little bit.
Didn't.

783
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:35,018
Did!
Did not!

784
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,519
Who's there?

785
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,352
Talk while you still
have lips.

786
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:14,526
Shut it, Kimura.

787
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,276
Sterling.

788
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,442
Uh-uh. Eyes front,
hands up.

789
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:23,449
Ooh. Scratch that.
Pick up your towel.

790
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,950
One hand up.

791
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:28,116
What do you want?

792
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:29,747
Here's how this works.

793
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,374
I ask the questions,
you answer.

794
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,585
What?

795
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,120
I don't know
how to answer that.

796
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:37,539
How did you get here?

797
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:38,668
Huh? How did I...

798
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,087
I'm not telling you anything.

799
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:42,382
Stop! Get off of me.

800
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,883
You sold the Assassin
to a guy with a robot hand.

801
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,057
Where is he?

802
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,825
He'll kill me
if I tell you that.

803
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,301
Oh, and you think
I won't? Talk!

804
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,740
Remarkable.
A remote-operated pigeon.

805
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,234
How do you make it speak?

806
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:07,329
Oh!

807
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:14,371
All right, Kimura, 3 ounces of
pressure to the vagus nerve.

808
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,830
Sleepy night-night!

809
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,216
I miss my hands.

810
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:27,922
Lance Sterling
is gonna die a pigeon...

811
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,842
and be buried in a shoebox.

812
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:40,401
Lance, are you okay?

813
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:41,731
Walter?

814
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:48,034
Sterling is here somewhere.
I want agents on every exit.

815
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:49,614
And everyone be careful.

816
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,366
This is Lance Sterling
we're dealing with.

817
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:53,740
Tell me where
Robo Hand is.

818
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:54,834
Never.

819
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:57,752
Boy, I'm about to
pigeon-wing-slap...

820
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:02,085
Oh. Oh, tough guy.
Okay.

821
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,796
Then we do it
the hard way.

822
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,676
Walter,
I need a funnel,

823
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,243
jumper cables,
and a Nickelback album.

824
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:08,306
Nickelback?

825
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:09,972
What?
But that would hurt him.

826
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,552
That's the whole point.

827
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:13,434
I know what to do.

828
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:16,558
No, no, no.

829
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:18,185
Don't do that.
Ooh.

830
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:19,812
That's what
I'm talking about, Walter.

831
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:20,902
Go science on this fool!

832
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:22,318
Oh, yeah!

833
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,228
I'm gonna science
all over your face.

834
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:26,193
Please, don't!

835
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:32,494
Did you just give that
man a refreshing spritz?

836
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:34,405
It's a truth serum,
but yes,

837
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,910
it has a lavender
quality to it.

838
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:37,037
Watch.

839
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:39,039
Kimura,
what's your biggest secret?

840
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:40,878
I peed in the pool.

841
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,293
That's a lot of honesty.

842
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,341
Who is Robo Hand?
And why is he wearing my face?

843
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:47,752
I don't know who he is.

844
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,170
Then what do you know?

845
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,708
Well, I know
how to play the flute.

846
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,181
About Robo Hand!

847
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,262
I know he's on his way
to Venice right now

848
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,889
to steal the Agent Database.

849
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,436
He's going to kill me.

850
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,221
Agent Database?
Database.

851
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:00,502
Who says "database"?

852
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:01,526
Shut up.

853
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,977
He'll know the identities
of everyone at the Agency.

854
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,903
And once he does...

855
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:10,237
he'll use the Assassin
to eliminate all of them.

856
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,947
Not if I stop him first.

857
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,448
She is relentless.

858
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,366
Block the door.
We need something heavy.

859
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,539
I'm heavy.

860
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:24,966
Are you pulling?

861
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:27,133
Of course I'm pulling!
Why aren't you pushing?

862
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:28,447
Just put your weight
behind it.

863
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:30,632
I am putting my weight!
I'm feathers!

864
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:36,851
It's like a big bag
of pudding!

865
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:41,646
Ugh. Yuck.

866
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:44,103
This is so embarrassing.

867
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,733
Come on, Walter.
Use your glutes.

868
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:51,733
You're out of moves, Sterling.

869
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:53,492
You and Beckett
are wanted for treason.

870
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:54,902
We gotta go. Now.

871
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:56,287
No. Don't leave me
like this.

872
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:57,822
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

873
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,581
Ears?
Consider it done.

874
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:05,525
We gotta get to that balcony.
We're gonna have to parkour.

875
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:06,549
What?

876
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:08,124
Cat pass! Tic-tac!
Jelly roll!

877
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,712
Desk lamp!
Flimflam! Bottle cap!

878
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,548
I don't know
what any of that means.

879
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,176
Hi.

880
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:20,185
What the... What happened
to you?

881
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:22,187
Oh, don't do that.
You're gonna make me...

882
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,046
Now or never, Walter.
Gotta go! Come on, Walter!

883
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,276
You can do this!

884
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:29,277
Okay, it's a physics problem,
Walter. Come on.

885
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,779
It's basic physics!

886
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,565
It's just basic physics.

887
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:39,159
You're right.

888
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:40,831
- We can do this.
- Beckett!

889
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,354
- We can do this.
- Beckett, don't you...

890
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:43,498
We're gonna do this!

891
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:44,671
We can do this!

892
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,844
Use your gadgets!

893
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,551
Use your gadgets!

894
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,890
A-ha! Grappling hook!

895
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:02,845
Fly! Fly!
What am I doing wrong?

896
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,600
There he is!

897
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:13,402
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

898
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,948
Well, that's not good.

899
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,131
Oh!

900
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,975
Walter, what else
you got on that pen?

901
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:32,469
No.

902
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:40,258
Oh, hello, soft landing.

903
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:42,059
Oh! Whoa!

904
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,394
Walter!

905
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,013
Go, go, go!

906
00:49:58,037 --> 00:49:59,743
Oh, these guys
are the worst.

907
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:01,016
- There he is!
- Don't move!

908
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,496
The multi-pen!

909
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,202
Yes! Great.
Shoot 'em!

910
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,496
Well, that is suboptimal.

911
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:10,208
That has a bit of
a suck factor to it.

912
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,427
Yeah, pillow.
Good call.

913
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:21,427
Lance, get down.

914
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:23,593
Get down!

915
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:30,357
Huh?

916
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,402
Serious string.

917
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,689
Like Silly String,
but serious.

918
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:39,108
Oddly effective.

919
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:41,865
Come on, let's ghost.

920
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:44,788
There's something
you don't see every day.

921
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:47,416
Wow. This is tripped out.

922
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,872
This is...
I don't know what this is.

923
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,958
This couldn't
have been Sterling.

924
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,417
No one's even hurt.

925
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,128
It might be
that kid, Beckett.

926
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,712
But that doesn't make sense!

927
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,469
Beckett is just some nobody
in the gadget lab.

928
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,880
Well, according
to his file,

929
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:03,432
that "nobody"
graduated MIT at 15...

930
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:06,594
and invented a way
to edit human genomes

931
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:08,099
in middle school.

932
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:10,265
Dude is Jeopardy! smart.

933
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:12,103
Well, so are we.

934
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,565
I stepped in it.

935
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,198
I stepped in the goo.

936
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:18,731
Yeah, me, too.

937
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:21,776
These are my new kicks, man.

938
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:31,796
I hope this works.

939
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,191
I hope this works.
I hope this works.

940
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:35,126
Please, please, please.

941
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,016
Weapons system online.

942
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,968
Agent Database
required for targeting.

943
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,105
It's done!

944
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:52,515
The entire facility
is running at full capacity.

945
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:54,587
Everything is exactly
how you wanted it.

946
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:59,317
But, please, the destruction
this is capable of...

947
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:03,317
Since when
does your agency care

948
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:06,700
about the many, many,
many lives it destroys?

949
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:10,082
No!
Wait, wait, wait! No, no, no!

950
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,834
No, please, please!
Wait, wait, wait!

951
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:15,041
You said if I helped you,
you'd let me go.

952
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:18,457
Oh, yeah, I did.
Didn't I?

953
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:24,422
I hear Venice is wonderful
this time of year.

954
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:33,230
Aw, yeah.

955
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,981
Just wait
till I get to Venice.

956
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:37,230
I'mma tear that fool
his own cloaca.

957
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:40,073
Walter!

958
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,356
Walter!
Huh? What?

959
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,365
You're still working
on that antidote, right?

960
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,235
Working on it?

961
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,698
In a couple minutes,
it's done.

962
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,785
But do you know
what else is working?

963
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,324
If you say being a pigeon...

964
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:53,868
Being a pigeon!

965
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:55,953
I'm really gonna
throw this boy in the ocean.

966
00:52:56,048 --> 00:52:57,088
What?

967
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:59,043
Hey, how did
y'all get here?

968
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:01,591
Jeff and Crazy Eyes
aren't going to abandon you.

969
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:03,753
- They're part of your flock.
- Come on. No.

970
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:04,971
Get your beak
out my drink.

971
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,493
I have no idea
where that beak has been.

972
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:07,597
Back out.

973
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:09,759
- No! Stop it!
- Okay, okay.

974
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:11,018
Here you go, guys.
Come on.

975
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:13,141
Have some of these.
They're gluten-free.

976
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:14,315
You're joking, right?

977
00:53:14,483 --> 00:53:16,974
That one ate gum
stuck to a tissue.

978
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,605
And a spy pen.

979
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:24,694
We should probably
do something about that.

980
00:53:27,246 --> 00:53:28,281
It's ready.

981
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,740
Finally.

982
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:42,382
May I?

983
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,505
Not this time, Lovey.
Thank you.

984
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:46,052
Ow!

985
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,425
Joker.

986
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:04,029
Well, that's not good.

987
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,815
"Not good" as in
it'll taste bad

988
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,696
but still turn me back
into a human?

989
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,402
Mmm, "not good" as in
it won't turn you

990
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,497
back into a human...

991
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,825
and if you drink it, all your
cells will catch on fire.

992
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:14,959
Come on, man!

993
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,700
I'm sorry.
I'll figure it out.

994
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,035
Science is
all trial and error.

995
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,044
This isn't
a science lab.

996
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:23,207
If I don't stop this guy,
people will die!

997
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,071
You don't think
that I want to stop him, too?

998
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,460
Why do you think
I'm on this boat?

999
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,845
Do you have any idea

1000
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,469
of how much motion sickness
medication I'm on right now?

1001
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:34,680
I can hardly feel my legs!

1002
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:38,310
But I'm here
because I believe...

1003
00:54:38,484 --> 00:54:43,899
together, we can find
a good way to stop the bad.

1004
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:48,615
I know you do, man.

1005
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,819
But it's a fantasy.

1006
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:56,282
When the bad guys hit you,
you hit 'em back.

1007
00:54:57,085 --> 00:55:00,669
You hit 'em so hard
that they don't get back up.

1008
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:04,461
You gotta fight fire
with fire.

1009
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:08,719
When we fight fire with fire,
we all get burned.

1010
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:12,096
There's no good guys
or bad guys.

1011
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:13,844
Just people.

1012
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:18,012
And people are worth saving.

1013
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:20,226
Isn't that our job?

1014
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:26,274
Evil doesn't care
that you're nice.

1015
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:35,617
I watch good people
be taken every day.

1016
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,033
But you wouldn't know
nothing about that.

1017
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,503
You'd be surprised.

1018
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,073
First time in Venice?

1019
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:13,700
First time anywhere, really.

1020
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:15,111
It's always been my dream

1021
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,786
to come here
and feed the pigeons.

1022
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:18,894
You need help.

1023
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,372
Time to put
your game face on.

1024
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:28,961
That's the Agency Data Vault.

1025
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:30,501
Data Vault.

1026
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:32,882
If Robo Hand wants
a list of agents,

1027
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:34,053
that's where he'll find it.

1028
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,138
You remember the plan?

1029
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:37,310
What plan?

1030
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:38,663
You said, "Stay out of the
way and let me kick some..."

1031
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:39,687
Good. You remember it.

1032
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:43,764
Long way
from home, Walter.

1033
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:45,808
Kimura talked.

1034
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:48,819
I know Sterling's here
in Venice. Where is he?

1035
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:50,604
Stay cool.

1036
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:53,274
Where's Sterling?

1037
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:55,818
I can tell you
where he's not.

1038
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:58,453
Which is right here.

1039
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:02,370
What? No,
we can't just kill her.

1040
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,375
That's dark, Lovey.

1041
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:08,038
Look, I know
you're not a criminal.

1042
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:10,423
You're a bright kid.

1043
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:15,429
You're inventing things that
nobody has ever thought of.

1044
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,966
I know because my boot is
still stuck in one of 'em.

1045
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,475
Sorry.

1046
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:24,521
No, no. We're the ones
who owe you an apology.

1047
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:28,024
You're trying to keep
the world safe...

1048
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:30,060
just like your mother did.

1049
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:34,072
I read your file.

1050
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:38,869
I know she sacrificed her life
to save people.

1051
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,910
I can help you, Walter.

1052
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:45,496
I can get you
your job back.

1053
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:48,788
A new lab.
All the equipment you need.

1054
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:52,458
Show them what you can do...

1055
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:57,050
and no one will
ever call you weird again.

1056
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:01,804
You just have
to give me Sterling.

1057
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:05,106
No.

1058
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,560
We should
all be working together.

1059
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:11,317
Bad move, Beckett.

1060
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:13,531
Sterling!

1061
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:16,235
Stay here.

1062
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:18,442
Let's go.

1063
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:24,414
- It's the Assassin.
- Come on.

1064
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:25,704
Destroy the target!

1065
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:26,896
We can't let that thing
out of here.

1066
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,000
Open fire!

1067
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:29,232
It's got the database.

1068
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:31,580
Oh, man.

1069
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:32,878
It's not working!

1070
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:34,048
I'm on it.

1071
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:37,761
This is not good!

1072
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,296
- Take cover!
- Now!

1073
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,064
Let's go.
Beckett, don't you...

1074
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:51,635
Don't worry. We'll stop it.
Beckett!

1075
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:54,812
I mean, I'll stop it, because
Lance is definitely not here.

1076
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:03,904
We can't catch this thing
on foot.

1077
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,351
Whoa, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

1078
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,375
You're a pigeon, Lance.

1079
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,812
You're one of the fastest
birds in the world.

1080
00:59:07,836 --> 00:59:09,042
No, put me down, Walter!

1081
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,952
You need to fly!
I believe in you.

1082
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:12,166
There's another way!

1083
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:15,047
Boy, don't you throw me
off this roof!

1084
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:18,927
He'll figure it out.

1085
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:23,924
Come on.
I'm gonna die.

1086
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:29,638
I'm flying.

1087
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,727
I'm flying.

1088
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:32,818
I'm flying...

1089
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:35,269
Oh, you're flying me.

1090
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:37,187
Thank you.
Good looking out.

1091
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:38,692
Whoa!

1092
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:42,742
Whoa. All right, guys.
Let's go!

1093
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:44,236
We got an Assassin to catch.

1094
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,904
Excuse me.
Sorry.

1095
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,252
That works, too.

1096
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:52,623
This is official business!
Oh.

1097
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,424
Okay.

1098
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:02,629
Phew.

1099
01:00:04,893 --> 01:00:06,508
This is official business!

1100
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,310
We need to get
that database.

1101
01:00:09,481 --> 01:00:10,481
Any ideas?

1102
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:14,274
Oh! I like how you think.

1103
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:17,151
Bullseye!

1104
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,528
Got it.

1105
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:24,446
Yeah, didn't think
he'd like that.

1106
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:26,705
Good job.

1107
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,866
Oh, that's right.
You all like games.

1108
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,580
Let's play
some Keep Away.

1109
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:34,713
Go long.

1110
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,419
Oh, no!

1111
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:49,513
Not so easy,
is it, Roomba?

1112
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,855
Lovey, all you, girl!

1113
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,815
Hit me. I'm open.

1114
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:57,771
I got it! I got it!

1115
01:00:57,946 --> 01:00:58,946
Oh, no.

1116
01:01:11,543 --> 01:01:13,454
Oh, no, no, no!

1117
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:14,837
This is about to suck!

1118
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,956
No!

1119
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:21,666
Come on, come on, come on!

1120
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:29,265
Catch of the century!

1121
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:31,392
I've never caught anything
in my whole life!

1122
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:38,316
That was amazing.
We did it!

1123
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:39,463
We're gonna
talk about

1124
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:40,548
you throwing me
off that roof, though.

1125
01:01:40,572 --> 01:01:42,508
Yeah, I really thought
that would work out better.

1126
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:43,572
Nah, it's cool, it's cool.

1127
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:44,802
We're gonna holler
about it in a minute.

1128
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:46,512
You know, I'm gonna let you
have this moment.

1129
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,367
Whoo! We're unstoppable...

1130
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:05,969
Uh-uh-uh.

1131
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:08,422
That belongs to me.

1132
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:12,889
Technically, it belongs to
the United States government.

1133
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:17,852
Lance! Lance!

1134
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,350
Sterling?

1135
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,393
What do you say, Lance?

1136
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:26,023
Come out.
We'll have some good fun.

1137
01:02:26,201 --> 01:02:28,032
You're the hero, right?

1138
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:31,036
The spy who saves the day...

1139
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:35,040
destroying anybody
that stands in your way.

1140
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,877
Oh, I'd love
to have some fun.

1141
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:44,416
Guess he's not coming.

1142
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:47,085
No.

1143
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:50,464
Ah, life's full
of disappointment.

1144
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:54,267
You don't have
to do it this way.

1145
01:02:54,396 --> 01:02:55,602
It won't make
anything better.

1146
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:56,852
No.

1147
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,103
No!

1148
01:02:59,651 --> 01:03:01,016
Walter!

1149
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:21,586
Breadcrumbs?

1150
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,334
They're gluten-free.

1151
01:03:34,853 --> 01:03:36,343
Lance, let's go.

1152
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,985
Hold it right there!

1153
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:48,609
Turn around
nice and slow!

1154
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,775
Hands where I can see them.

1155
01:03:57,167 --> 01:03:59,123
Both hands.

1156
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:01,622
Watch out!

1157
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:09,342
Did anybody else see that
Agent Sterling had...

1158
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,628
A robot hand?

1159
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:12,973
Yeah.

1160
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:23,314
Phew.
Totally crazy.

1161
01:04:23,485 --> 01:04:25,629
When he had his foot on my
head, I was like...

1162
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:26,984
And you were like, "No!"

1163
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:29,066
And then, I was like,
"Breadcrumbs!"

1164
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:31,489
He still got away
with the database.

1165
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:36,870
Or did he?

1166
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,739
Or did he?

1167
01:04:39,918 --> 01:04:41,624
I feel like
you want me to say,

1168
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:42,831
"What are you
talking about?"

1169
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,585
Oh, I'll tell you
what I'm talking about.

1170
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:47,543
During the whole
bird-nado thing,

1171
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:48,874
I put a tracker on him.

1172
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:51,543
Wait. That's him?

1173
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,131
That's Robo Hand?

1174
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,388
Yep.
Yes!

1175
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:56,968
Yes! My man!

1176
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:58,724
Oh, there is no way

1177
01:04:58,812 --> 01:05:00,456
I could have done this
without you, Walter.

1178
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,220
What?
What?

1179
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:03,847
What did you say?

1180
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:05,185
I think I said...

1181
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,601
You said you couldn't
have done it without me.

1182
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:21,792
All right.

1183
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,292
Okay, we've reached the
time limit on this, Walter.

1184
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:26,703
All right, hey, hey,
will you stop?

1185
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:28,880
You're squeezing too...

1186
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:30,207
Oh! Whoa!

1187
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:41,802
Walter, what happens
in the submarine

1188
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:43,636
stays in the submarine.

1189
01:05:43,815 --> 01:05:45,225
You just laid an egg.

1190
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:46,647
You laid an egg!

1191
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,858
It just kinda
slipped out, man.

1192
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:50,268
You just laid an egg!

1193
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:52,062
Lance, this is amazing.

1194
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,605
Do you not realize
what this means?

1195
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:54,700
You're a girl!

1196
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:55,903
Oh! Excuse me?

1197
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:57,283
Of course, of course.

1198
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:58,934
That's why
I couldn't figure this out.

1199
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:01,739
I used Lovey's DNA in the serum.

1200
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:03,656
And that helps us how?

1201
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:05,450
Because now
all I need to do

1202
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:07,501
is change one variable
in the antidote...

1203
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:09,003
and you'll be human again.

1204
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:11,372
I'm gonna be me.

1205
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:13,542
Unless, you know,

1206
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:16,002
maybe you wanna stay
a pigeon a little longer.

1207
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:18,849
Right.

1208
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:20,886
Of course.

1209
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,176
One antidote
coming right up.

1210
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:37,820
Director Jenkins,
we lost the database.

1211
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,905
Every Agency employee
is compromised.

1212
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,039
You need to pull everyone in
for their own safety.

1213
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,581
And you're sure
it was Lance?

1214
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:46,752
Yes.

1215
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:48,086
Maybe?

1216
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:50,707
Okay, I don't know
what I saw.

1217
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:54,291
But I still know for a fact

1218
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:56,091
that Sterling came here
on this boat.

1219
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:57,490
Sterling wasn't on this boat.

1220
01:06:57,514 --> 01:06:58,514
Son of a...

1221
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:01,218
Come on!
There's gotta be something.

1222
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:03,474
A footprint,
a candy wrapper,

1223
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:05,017
some overpriced
face lotion...

1224
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:06,394
because there is no way

1225
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:08,267
that his skin looks
that good without help.

1226
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:09,977
Look, everything is
coming up blank.

1227
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:11,391
If Sterling was
on this boat...

1228
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:13,025
he didn't leave
a fingerprint,

1229
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:14,977
his lips never touched
a glass...

1230
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:18,565
and somehow
he didn't have feet.

1231
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:21,655
I think it's safe
to say that

1232
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:24,488
your investigation
isn't getting anywhere.

1233
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:30,250
Huh.

1234
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:44,735
Lance?

1235
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:48,241
Lance?

1236
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:50,660
Oh...

1237
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:51,752
Did it work?

1238
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:53,830
Okay, take it easy.

1239
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:00,174
I got my hands back.

1240
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:02,127
Yes! Yes!

1241
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:03,715
Oh, my pecs.

1242
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:05,972
My pectoral muscles.
My abdominalia.

1243
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:09,134
Oh, Walter, you are a...

1244
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:10,354
I just...

1245
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,680
I can do that
'cause I got lips now!

1246
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,687
I'm naked.

1247
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:18,226
Little bit awkward.

1248
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:20,110
Lucky for you,
I planned ahead.

1249
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:21,281
Good call.

1250
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,360
There he is.

1251
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:28,778
Lance Sterling.
Back in action.

1252
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:32,369
You have
arrived at your destination.

1253
01:09:33,378 --> 01:09:34,618
All right, Robo Hand.

1254
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:37,211
I'm coming for you.

1255
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:09,782
Okay. Robo Hand
is a mile due west.

1256
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:11,366
So, what's the plan,
partner?

1257
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:14,704
I got plenty of glitter,
yay-palm, a splat-a-pult...

1258
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:16,117
No.

1259
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:17,375
No what?

1260
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:19,208
I'm taking it
from here, Walter.

1261
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:20,588
You're kidding, right?

1262
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:22,294
Look, lives are on the line.

1263
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:23,468
I got this now.

1264
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:25,001
You've got this?

1265
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:27,215
But we're a team.
You said so yourself.

1266
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:28,470
And you did your job.

1267
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:29,972
You un-birded me.

1268
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:32,759
Now it's time
to do things my way.

1269
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:34,726
End this fool.

1270
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:36,307
That's wrong.

1271
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:38,143
You're so wrong.

1272
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:39,717
Look, I've got
everything that we...

1273
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:43,149
This is not the place
for your weird gadgets.

1274
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:46,026
Weird?

1275
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:51,490
Go home.

1276
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:56,209
No.

1277
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:59,418
I'm not giving up. Ow.

1278
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:05,211
Lance...

1279
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:08,795
I can't lose
any more good people.

1280
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:23,351
I fly solo.

1281
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:23,706
Ow!

1282
01:13:00,585 --> 01:13:02,416
I think that's yours.

1283
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:05,878
But that face
you've been using is mine.

1284
01:13:06,257 --> 01:13:07,588
It's over.

1285
01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:09,919
Database isn't gonna
do you any good

1286
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:11,967
with your fancy toy
messed up like that.

1287
01:13:14,849 --> 01:13:18,433
You really thought
I was gonna use one drone...

1288
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:21,595
to take out every name
on this list?

1289
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:24,271
I mean, I did.

1290
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:26,899
Until you asked
that question that way.

1291
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:28,229
Casts a little doubt.

1292
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:30,228
Tell me, Agent Sterling.

1293
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:35,532
You managed
to stop one drone.

1294
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:41,955
How do you plan
on stopping 1,000?

1295
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:55,586
Sleepy night-night.

1296
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:09,065
Huh?

1297
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:18,192
Do you feel
that dread?

1298
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:19,823
Oh, can you feel it?

1299
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:24,286
Rolling around you
like a fog.

1300
01:14:25,252 --> 01:14:27,243
I told you.
I don't even know you, man.

1301
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:30,413
But I know you.

1302
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:31,831
Think about it.

1303
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:33,510
No?

1304
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:35,214
I'll give you
a little bit of help.

1305
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:39,842
Kyrgyzstan.

1306
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:42,925
Ah...

1307
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,476
He remembers.

1308
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:46,933
I mean, I certainly
never forgot that day.

1309
01:14:47,108 --> 01:14:49,770
You were magnificent.

1310
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:51,935
You were a one-man army.

1311
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:53,899
Lot of witty
catchphrases...

1312
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:58,737
and you had all these fancy
toys that just went boom!

1313
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:01,027
Boom.

1314
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:04,905
Boom.

1315
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:08,951
You were a bunch
of bad dudes

1316
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:11,753
about to hurt
a lot of innocent people.

1317
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:15,007
And it's my job
to keep everyone safe.

1318
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:17,714
Everyone?

1319
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:25,344
I watched every single
one of my people die...

1320
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:30,515
as your agency's weapons
rained down on us.

1321
01:15:34,488 --> 01:15:36,979
You took everything
from me.

1322
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:42,277
And you know the rules.

1323
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:47,039
You hit me hard, Sterling.

1324
01:15:49,837 --> 01:15:52,374
I hit back harder.

1325
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:06,266
All of this...

1326
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:11,764
because of you.

1327
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:25,527
He's coming back
for me.

1328
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,833
Walter, no.
No, no, no.

1329
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:31,920
Walter.

1330
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:34,086
No, no, no.
Okay.

1331
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:41,669
Hey, this kid is harmless.

1332
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:45,180
He doesn't have anything
to do with this, okay?

1333
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:46,351
We can figure this out.

1334
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:47,519
Look at me, look at me.

1335
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:49,517
I'm sorry, all right?

1336
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:50,928
There's another way!

1337
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:52,107
Do you hear me?

1338
01:16:56,904 --> 01:16:58,314
Do not hurt this kid.

1339
01:17:02,493 --> 01:17:03,493
Oh, no.

1340
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:04,696
Don't...
Don't do this.

1341
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:07,778
Please.
No, no, no.

1342
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:09,413
Don't do this!
No!

1343
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:14,460
No!

1344
01:17:21,095 --> 01:17:23,711
I'm taking
everything from you.

1345
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:53,308
Huh?

1346
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:01,229
Oh, right. Yeah.

1347
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:04,274
Walter.

1348
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:05,775
But I saw...

1349
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:07,065
How did you...

1350
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:09,484
Oh, you know,
one of my weird gadgets.

1351
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,907
The inflatable hug.

1352
01:19:13,624 --> 01:19:15,580
Thought I lost you, man.

1353
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:19,452
I'll always have
your back, Lance.

1354
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:21,916
That's what it means
to be a team.

1355
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:25,841
It's something I learned
a long time ago.

1356
01:19:28,222 --> 01:19:29,222
From your mom?

1357
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:34,721
You're a good friend, Walter.

1358
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:43,567
And, hey, I'm sorry for
shooting you in your neck.

1359
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:46,816
I'm sorry for the cloaca.

1360
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:51,946
So, what's your plan
to stop this guy?

1361
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:53,782
Nope. Not my plan.

1362
01:19:53,956 --> 01:19:55,321
Time to do it your way.

1363
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:57,243
My way?

1364
01:19:57,418 --> 01:19:59,625
Oh, yeah. We about
to Walter-ize this thing.

1365
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:01,953
Well, in that case...

1366
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:03,996
we're gonna need
a bigger flock.

1367
01:20:04,174 --> 01:20:05,539
You're calling Marcy,
aren't you?

1368
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:08,050
Yep.
Tell her I said hi.

1369
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:18,681
Let's get weird.
Boom.

1370
01:20:32,411 --> 01:20:35,073
Nowhere to run
from this, Lance.

1371
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:39,206
Listen, I'm sorry about
what happened in Kyrgyzstan.

1372
01:20:39,376 --> 01:20:43,039
But we are stuck in this
good guy-bad guy vortex.

1373
01:20:43,213 --> 01:20:46,080
We do not have
to do it like this.

1374
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:48,712
Yeah, bit late for that.

1375
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:50,001
It's not.

1376
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:52,295
We're both just people
who make mistakes.

1377
01:20:52,431 --> 01:20:54,422
We can work this out, man.
That's it.

1378
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,716
Almost there.
You're doing great.

1379
01:20:56,894 --> 01:20:58,555
I mean, come on.

1380
01:20:58,729 --> 01:21:00,310
We can break this cycle.

1381
01:21:01,023 --> 01:21:02,388
Got it. I'm connected.

1382
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:04,227
Nobody else
has to get hurt.

1383
01:21:04,485 --> 01:21:07,898
You should know
better than anyone.

1384
01:21:11,575 --> 01:21:13,861
Someone always gets hurt.

1385
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:15,283
Not today-day.

1386
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:22,325
You brought
your own soundtrack?

1387
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:24,459
We like to make an entrance.

1388
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:28,463
Huh?

1389
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:29,630
Oh.

1390
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:52,945
Huh?

1391
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:56,491
Would you look at that?

1392
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:57,806
There's a man
with a robot hand

1393
01:21:57,830 --> 01:21:58,830
wearing your face...

1394
01:21:58,997 --> 01:22:00,578
who took the M9 Assassin.

1395
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:02,744
Guess I owe you
an apology.

1396
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:04,203
Okay. Go ahead.

1397
01:22:04,378 --> 01:22:06,460
No, that was it.
That was the apology.

1398
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:08,287
Oh. I accept.

1399
01:22:13,095 --> 01:22:15,381
But you gotta admit,
it was a little Scooby-Doo.

1400
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:17,342
Oh, 100% Scooby-Doo.

1401
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:19,973
I'm gonna make this hurt!

1402
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:28,523
Okay, come on through.

1403
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:30,255
You are safe here.
Come on.

1404
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:31,519
Is that everyone?

1405
01:22:31,697 --> 01:22:34,404
Director, we've got
unknown incoming.

1406
01:22:34,575 --> 01:22:35,610
Approaching fast.

1407
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:38,567
Oh, this is bad.

1408
01:22:48,172 --> 01:22:49,252
Lock this place down.

1409
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:07,763
We're sitting ducks.

1410
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:10,057
Walter hacked his hand.

1411
01:23:10,235 --> 01:23:12,213
We gotta buy him some time
to shut down the drones.

1412
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:14,102
Got it. What kind of
firepower we talking?

1413
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:18,861
Just go along with it.

1414
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:21,531
Take your best shot.

1415
01:23:21,622 --> 01:23:23,783
This one sucks.

1416
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:28,058
No, no, no,
that's binder bubbles.

1417
01:23:28,086 --> 01:23:29,701
Push the button on the back.

1418
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:31,836
Button on the back,
button on the back!

1419
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:39,263
Bubbles?

1420
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:41,672
Oh, you gotta let me
try that.

1421
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,681
That's a collide-oscope.
Throw it.

1422
01:23:57,616 --> 01:23:59,356
Splat-a-pult. Prism spray.
Hypno-stars.

1423
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:01,612
Snorepedo. Scream Team.

1424
01:24:01,954 --> 01:24:04,195
Well, what have we got to lose?

1425
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:07,959
11 o'clock.

1426
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:11,377
12 o'clock.
Half past 2! 4:30!

1427
01:24:12,756 --> 01:24:14,621
Security blanket.

1428
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:16,422
It's upside down.

1429
01:24:17,427 --> 01:24:18,747
I'm a hugger.

1430
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:20,093
Whoa.

1431
01:24:26,687 --> 01:24:27,687
Nice shot.

1432
01:24:28,855 --> 01:24:30,937
I was aiming
for your face.

1433
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:32,817
Thank you?

1434
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:35,355
Walter, gonna need
a reload, buddy.

1435
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:37,190
Ask and you shall receive.

1436
01:24:37,864 --> 01:24:39,650
Are those pigeons
wearing tiny backpacks?

1437
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:42,065
Yay!

1438
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,116
Now, that's hot.
That's hot.

1439
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:47,533
I call it Fifty Shades of Yay!

1440
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:49,699
Oh, come on, now!

1441
01:24:49,876 --> 01:24:51,207
You ready
to tap out yet?

1442
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:10,479
Gadget lab.

1443
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:14,190
Get to the gadget lab!
Grab every weapon you can!

1444
01:25:15,152 --> 01:25:17,017
Stop! Get back!

1445
01:25:18,989 --> 01:25:20,650
Oh, no.

1446
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:29,078
Yay!

1447
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:30,486
I'm a hugger.

1448
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:38,706
Walter, my face
can't take much more of this.

1449
01:25:38,884 --> 01:25:40,403
You keep doing your thing
and I'll do mine.

1450
01:25:40,427 --> 01:25:41,487
Yeah, well, your thing
seems to be

1451
01:25:41,511 --> 01:25:42,591
a lot easier
than my thing.

1452
01:25:42,763 --> 01:25:44,173
We have
different skillsets.

1453
01:25:44,264 --> 01:25:45,575
That's what makes us
such a great team.

1454
01:25:45,599 --> 01:25:46,599
Dude.

1455
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:07,530
Excuse me. Ugh.

1456
01:26:07,621 --> 01:26:09,236
Whoo.
Why do I smell lavender?

1457
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:10,699
We just got spritzed.

1458
01:26:10,874 --> 01:26:12,159
Uh-oh. Truth serum.

1459
01:26:12,334 --> 01:26:13,334
I have five cats,

1460
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:14,937
each named after a member
of New Kids on the Block.

1461
01:26:14,961 --> 01:26:15,961
Oh, I love New Kids.

1462
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:17,482
Jon, Joey, Jordan,
Donnie, and Danny.

1463
01:26:17,506 --> 01:26:19,371
I really wanna
hurt you right now.

1464
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:25,513
You.

1465
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:27,637
What...
What are you doing?

1466
01:26:27,808 --> 01:26:29,048
I'm not
telling you anything.

1467
01:26:29,142 --> 01:26:30,203
I'll tell you
what he's doing.

1468
01:26:30,227 --> 01:26:31,287
He's gonna hack
into your claw

1469
01:26:31,311 --> 01:26:32,426
and shut down
your drones.

1470
01:26:32,604 --> 01:26:34,344
Wow, this stuff
really works.

1471
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,030
No, no, no.

1472
01:26:46,076 --> 01:26:47,862
No!

1473
01:26:54,584 --> 01:26:56,290
Whoa!
I'm coming, Walter.

1474
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:07,552
Almost there. Don't let go.
Please don't let go.

1475
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:18,646
Walter!

1476
01:27:24,156 --> 01:27:25,191
Walter.

1477
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:37,036
Come on, come on.

1478
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:43,629
Somebody do something.

1479
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:56,848
If you shut 'em down now,
you'll kill us both.

1480
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:02,891
And you're no killer.

1481
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:08,647
No. I'm a hugger.

1482
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:10,281
What?

1483
01:28:15,332 --> 01:28:20,452
One day, your gadgets
are gonna keep the world safe.

1484
01:28:43,485 --> 01:28:44,600
Yes!
Yes!

1485
01:28:44,778 --> 01:28:46,609
Never wash
that hand again!

1486
01:29:01,378 --> 01:29:03,369
I got you, Walter!

1487
01:29:03,547 --> 01:29:05,754
Lance? What are you...

1488
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:09,628
It's okay.

1489
01:29:09,803 --> 01:29:11,213
It's okay.

1490
01:29:11,888 --> 01:29:13,549
You can't do this alone.

1491
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:16,097
I am not alone!

1492
01:29:17,894 --> 01:29:19,225
Lovey?

1493
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:23,058
Come on, birds!

1494
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:26,816
Fly!

1495
01:29:51,803 --> 01:29:53,043
Walter.

1496
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:54,670
Walter.

1497
01:29:57,934 --> 01:30:00,596
What does internal
bleeding feel like?

1498
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:03,011
This.
It feels like this.

1499
01:30:03,189 --> 01:30:04,189
Oh, come here.

1500
01:30:04,357 --> 01:30:05,563
No, no, no. No hugs.

1501
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:06,734
You gonna make me

1502
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:08,558
lay an egg or something
in front of Marcy.

1503
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:15,899
Huh?

1504
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:23,289
He saved him.

1505
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:28,745
I think I need a vet.

1506
01:30:29,466 --> 01:30:32,003
Once I can move again,
I'll turn you back into a man.

1507
01:30:32,177 --> 01:30:33,177
Sterling.

1508
01:30:33,595 --> 01:30:34,926
You're a bird?

1509
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:36,586
Uh, hey, Marcy.

1510
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:38,847
That's why
I couldn't find you!

1511
01:30:42,062 --> 01:30:44,303
Whoa, you're a bird.
That is messed up.

1512
01:30:44,481 --> 01:30:45,481
It's weird, right?

1513
01:30:45,649 --> 01:30:46,649
This is amazing.

1514
01:30:46,816 --> 01:30:47,816
We did it.

1515
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:50,396
We took down the drones,
beat the bad guy,

1516
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:51,818
saved countless lives.

1517
01:30:51,988 --> 01:30:54,195
We are so gonna get
our jobs back!

1518
01:30:56,743 --> 01:30:58,734
So, triple fired.

1519
01:30:58,912 --> 01:31:01,494
Yeah, man, that's gotta
be some kind of record.

1520
01:31:01,998 --> 01:31:03,738
I really didn't see
that coming.

1521
01:31:03,917 --> 01:31:07,785
Well, we did break a bunch of
laws, and defied orders...

1522
01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:10,124
and, I mean, committed
a little bit of treason.

1523
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:11,788
Oh, right, yeah,
the treason.

1524
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:13,673
Forgot about
the treason.

1525
01:31:13,843 --> 01:31:16,550
Hey.
It doesn't matter, man.

1526
01:31:16,721 --> 01:31:17,961
Look around.

1527
01:31:20,183 --> 01:31:23,220
Your mother would be
so proud of you right now.

1528
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:27,599
You kept
all those people safe.

1529
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:31,517
And you did it your way.

1530
01:31:32,737 --> 01:31:35,274
But you also did this.

1531
01:31:35,365 --> 01:31:36,821
Yeah.

1532
01:31:36,992 --> 01:31:39,608
I'll figure that out.
Sorry.

1533
01:31:39,786 --> 01:31:41,492
You know,
this gluten-free stuff

1534
01:31:41,579 --> 01:31:43,069
is really starting
to grow on me.

1535
01:31:45,709 --> 01:31:47,165
So, what do we do now?

1536
01:31:47,293 --> 01:31:49,284
Oh, we could...

1537
01:31:52,757 --> 01:31:54,463
Huh?

1538
01:31:54,551 --> 01:31:55,551
Marcy?

1539
01:31:55,719 --> 01:31:57,801
Okay,
I can't see or hear...

1540
01:31:57,971 --> 01:32:01,714
but my other senses are
elevated, so you... Ow!

1541
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:05,225
Agent Sterling, I apologize
for the theatrics.

1542
01:32:05,395 --> 01:32:06,395
No, you don't.

1543
01:32:06,563 --> 01:32:08,374
You should have seen your
face when we grabbed you.

1544
01:32:08,398 --> 01:32:09,763
I didn't make a face.

1545
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:11,221
No one's ever looked
more scared.

1546
01:32:11,276 --> 01:32:12,276
Are you two finished?

1547
01:32:12,444 --> 01:32:14,025
We are gonna
be okay, Lance!

1548
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:16,436
Use your baby hand
to pick the lock!

1549
01:32:16,614 --> 01:32:19,071
Can you please
take that off him?

1550
01:32:19,242 --> 01:32:21,278
Okay, and you can...

1551
01:32:21,453 --> 01:32:23,114
Oh, hey. Hey, guys.

1552
01:32:23,955 --> 01:32:26,412
Is this about the treason?

1553
01:32:26,583 --> 01:32:28,414
Joy, what is going on?

1554
01:32:28,585 --> 01:32:30,746
We realize
we were wrong about you.

1555
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:33,002
You're the future
of this agency,

1556
01:32:33,089 --> 01:32:34,579
and we want you
to lead a new team.

1557
01:32:34,758 --> 01:32:36,794
A highly covert global...

1558
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:38,583
Let me stop you
right there.

1559
01:32:38,762 --> 01:32:40,468
I'm not leading nothing,

1560
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:42,967
unless my man
Walter's on the team.

1561
01:32:43,058 --> 01:32:44,264
Um...

1562
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:46,511
I think
she's talking to Walter.

1563
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:49,352
Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we...
Just put that down.

1564
01:32:49,522 --> 01:32:50,562
Sometimes,
he talks for me,

1565
01:32:50,607 --> 01:32:51,792
I'll talk for him,
'cause we a team.

1566
01:32:51,816 --> 01:32:52,816
Me?

1567
01:32:52,984 --> 01:32:55,270
We need people like you.

1568
01:32:55,445 --> 01:32:59,233
People who can help the
Agency do things a new way.

1569
01:32:59,824 --> 01:33:01,064
What do you say?

1570
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:04,696
Looks like we gonna
need some glitter.

1571
01:33:05,789 --> 01:33:06,789
Team Weird?

1572
01:33:06,956 --> 01:33:08,076
Team Weird.

1573
01:33:11,294 --> 01:33:13,294
Missile deactivated.
