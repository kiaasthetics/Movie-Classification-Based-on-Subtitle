so people listen to it,

340
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:45,723
that's a whole other bag.

341
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,024
And unless you get out there

342
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:49,025
and you try to do it,
you'll never know.

343
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,527
That's just the truth.

344
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,130
If there's one reason
we're supposed to be here,

345
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:55,065
it's to say something
so people wanna hear it.

346
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,700
Don't you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

347
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,069
Yeah, I do.

348
00:18:58,071 --> 00:19:01,138
I don't like it,
but I understand it.

349
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,607
Oh, I think
you like it a little bit.

350
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:07,343
I think I'm getting through
a little bit. I can see it.

351
00:19:07,345 --> 00:19:08,814
No, you can't.

352
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:12,117
It's a good thing we met.

353
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:14,552
- Yeah.
- For both of us.

354
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:16,687
- Trust me.
- I don't know what is going on.

355
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:18,389
- Honestly, what...
- Who does?

356
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:21,825
I'm in a cop bar, with
Jackson Maine. It's, like...

357
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,993
- (COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING)
- Jackson Maine!

358
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,328
I'm gonna wake up in a minute.

359
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,830
That's the thing
about when you get famous,

360
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,197
people start saying
your full name.

361
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:30,501
- Well, what do you want...
- Just "Jack."

362
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,402
Oh, speaking of...

363
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,571
Come on.

364
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:36,273
- What?
- Did you put that on?

365
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:40,377
You put that on. When did you
even go to the jukebox?

366
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,812
Oh, God!

367
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:44,282
I hear that song, and I just
wanna turn it the fuck off.

368
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:45,315
TOMMY: Jack Maine!

369
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,751
I fucked
that fucking song up so bad.

370
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:48,518
- No! What? Come on.
- Oh, my God!

371
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,455
Hey, I know that
we're not supposed to do this.

372
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,824
I know that we're not supposed
to come and bother you.

373
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,493
- You come here every night.
- That's all right.

374
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:57,360
You got your camera on you?
'Cause I don't have my camera.

375
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,428
Excuse me, one sec.

376
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,897
My ex-girlfriend was
fucking this guy.

377
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,264
- Right. Okay.
- Who looks like you,

378
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,565
- that's what she said.
- Shut the hell up.

379
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:03,633
But I gotta take
a picture of you

380
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,002
because I gotta send it to her

381
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,270
because I'm gonna show her
that you look

382
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:07,536
nothing fucking like
that fucking guy.

383
00:20:07,538 --> 00:20:08,805
OFFICER: Jack, I'm sorry.

384
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,274
JACK:
Maybe that'll help her out.

385
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:11,774
Will that help you out?
Will that make you happy?

386
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:13,010
Why don't we take
the fucking picture?

387
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:14,344
You want someone
to take the picture?

388
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:15,780
- Hey, no, no. It's okay.
- TOMMY: Excuse me.

389
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,347
You want someone
to take the picture?

390
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,949
- Get the fuck off, you little whore.
- What? What?

391
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,883
- Hey, come on. Stand up, yeah.
- ALLY: What?

392

(ALLY LAUGHING)

393
00:20:22,153 --> 00:20:23,887
- I'm sorry! No, Jack!
- I got you.

394
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,155
- It's all right.
- Oh, my God!

395
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,717
- No, no, it's all right.
- Why did I...

396
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:33,062
I'm fine, honestly. I'm okay.
This is so stupid.

397
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:35,932
No, you gotta get ahead
of the swelling.

398
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,633
Just try to find some...

399
00:20:37,635 --> 00:20:39,772
This is so embarrassing.

400
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:44,307
Here we go.
Yeah, put that on there.

401
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:47,246
Gotta wrap something up
with it. Find it.

402
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:51,148
- You like Cheetos?
- No, like gauze.

403
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,117
- Some gauze or something.
- Gauze?

404
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,255
Try to do that.
With that hand.

405
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,790
And do that hand.

406
00:20:58,623 --> 00:21:00,058
You play piano?

407
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,860
Yeah, we gotta
take care of this, then.

408
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:05,398
Oh, okay. Thanks.

409
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:14,103
And that's it, yeah. No, but
keep that on there, hold on.

410
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:16,907
Can you do that? Yeah.
Did you get it?

411
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:18,675
It's already gotten warm,
hasn't it?

412
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,080
- Should we have gotten two?
- It's okay. No, it's okay.

413
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,746
- Thanks.
- (CAMERA CLICKS)

414
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:26,550
I'm sorry. I had to.

415
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:28,054
That's all right.

416
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,755
It's not really all right,
though.

417
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:32,656
Have a good one.

418
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:34,658
- Be careful, she'll hit you.

are gonna get stuck

421
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,999
if you don't take them off.

422
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,234
- Does that hurt?
- Yeah.

423
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:46,236
- That's okay, though.
- May I?

424
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:47,406
Yeah.

- Put this on there.
- You're a sweetheart.

428
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:01,217
And we'll just wrap it up.

429
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:03,120
You'll be good to go.

430
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:05,790
How the hell do you deal
with that all the time?

431
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:08,425
- What's that?
- People just

432
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,326
talking to you
like you're not a real person

433
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,196
- or taking your picture.
- Is that too tight?

434
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:14,264
It's okay, thanks.

00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:17,802
- Oh. I hurt you.
- That's fine, it's okay. Ow...

There we go.
Now, you're mobile.

Right? I told you
it was worth coming here.

441
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:29,847
How do you do that?

442
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,116
- Do what?
- Don't change the subject.

443
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:33,449
Is that what I'm doing?

444
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:35,555
Nobody ever asked you
about you, huh?

445
00:22:36,921 --> 00:22:39,255
- Not sure.
- Where are you from?

446
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:40,492
Arizona.

- Arizona boy.
- Mmm-hmm.

I think.

Made his way to Arizona,
started working

for this family
on a pecan ranch.

- A pecan ranch?
- Yeah.

453
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,844
Knocked up
the family's daughter.

454
00:23:01,846 --> 00:23:03,613
She was just shy of 18.

Uh-oh. (LAUGHING)

- Yeah.

00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:13,724
Well, she died at childbirth.

- Then, my dad...
- I'm sorry.

He died when I was 13,

463

so I guess my brother would
tell you that he raised me,

who was raising who.

we can actually use those
