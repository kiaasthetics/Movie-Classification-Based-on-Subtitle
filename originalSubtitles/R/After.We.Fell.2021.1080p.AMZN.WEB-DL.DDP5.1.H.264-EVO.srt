2
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,849
No. You gotta get out now!
I can't do this anymore.

3
00:00:57,883 --> 00:00:59,717
I will not let her see you
like this.

4
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:02,319
- You need help!
- I didn't mean it. I'm sorry.

5
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,588
- You're always sorry.
- Come on.

6
00:01:04,622 --> 00:01:06,490
How am I
supposed to believe you?

7
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,526
- Every time!
- You've been trying...

8
00:01:08,559 --> 00:01:11,495
Do you know how many times
you've promised you would stop?

9
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,364
- This is not my fault.
- Not your fault?

10
00:01:13,397 --> 00:01:15,332
You're drunk.
In the middle of the day.

11
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,769
- Of course they fired you.
- Can we please talk about this?

12
00:01:17,803 --> 00:01:20,772
- You don't give a shit about us.
- Please.

13
00:01:20,806 --> 00:01:22,007
- You have to go.
- Don't do this.

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,674
Get out and don't come back

15
00:01:23,707 --> 00:01:25,342
till you're sober.

16
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,410
Daddy?

17
00:01:27,611 --> 00:01:28,780
Daddy!

18
00:01:32,017 --> 00:01:33,919
Daddy, don't go!

19
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,987
No! No, no, no. Dad, please!

20
00:01:37,856 --> 00:01:39,623
No, don't go.

21
00:01:39,657 --> 00:01:43,094
- Please don't go, please!
- Tessa! Tessa!

22
00:01:43,128 --> 00:01:48,133
Please, Daddy. Don't go.
Daddy, please don't go.

23
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:51,368
Daddy! No!

24
00:02:02,848 --> 00:02:06,051
I can't tell you how good it is
to see you again, Tessie.

25
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:13,825
There's towels in the bathroom,
if you want to take a shower.

26
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:16,660
- I'll make us some food.
- Thanks.

27
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:29,406
This is good.

28
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:33,078
I remember
you were quite the cook, Tessie.

29
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,047
- Thanks.
- Just like your mom.

30
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,186
I tried to call you, you know.

31
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:45,723
Sent you gifts
every birthday, Christmas.

32
00:02:45,757 --> 00:02:47,658
She didn't tell you, did she?

33
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,462
No.

34
00:02:52,529 --> 00:02:53,832
Yeah.

35
00:02:53,865 --> 00:02:56,700
So the prodigal father
has returned.

36
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:00,805
What for? What do you want?

37
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:04,009
You can stay, if...
If you want to.

38
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:07,012
We have room, and I don't
want you out on the street.

39
00:03:12,117 --> 00:03:14,986
- Are you still drinking?
- Can you excuse us for a second?

40
00:03:17,956 --> 00:03:20,225
I know that this isn't
the most convenient,

41
00:03:20,258 --> 00:03:22,227
but you, of all people,
should appreciate me

42
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,063
- giving him a second chance.
- Me, of all people, would know

43
00:03:25,096 --> 00:03:26,898
that he's probably
out there right now

44
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:29,034
shoving all of our shit
into his pockets.

45
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,103
He's gonna hurt you.

46
00:03:32,137 --> 00:03:34,471
- You don't know him.
- Neither do you.

47
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,008
It's been, what, 10 years
since you last saw him?

48
00:03:39,643 --> 00:03:40,711
Nine.

49
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:44,682
Look, I'm just trying
to protect you.

50
00:03:44,715 --> 00:03:46,885
I don't need you to protect me.

51
00:03:59,164 --> 00:04:00,932
I know exactly why you're here,

52
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:03,634
so you may as well just
take this and be on your way.

53
00:04:07,172 --> 00:04:08,907
I don't want your money, kid.

54
00:04:10,607 --> 00:04:13,144
All I want is a relationship
with my daughter.

55
00:04:15,747 --> 00:04:19,184
- If you hurt her...
- Hey, whoa, easy.

56
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,786
I know you have no reason
in the world to trust me,

57
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,955
but how about
you give me a shot, huh?

58
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:42,706
Well, have you found
a place in Seattle yet?

59
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,309
- Nope.
- No?

60
00:04:44,342 --> 00:04:47,678
- Nope.
- I'm gonna miss you, dude.

61
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:49,314
Gonna have to start watching
<i>The Kardashians</i>

62
00:04:49,347 --> 00:04:51,715
to get my fill of drama
in your absence.

63
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,853
Landon, I'm only going
to Seattle.

64
00:04:54,886 --> 00:04:57,588
You're just a FaceTime away.
You can always visit.

65
00:04:57,621 --> 00:05:00,258
Between work and school,
you are gonna be swamped.

66
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,659
You're not gonna have
any time for anything,

67
00:05:02,693 --> 00:05:05,964
like friends, family and
especially not people like...

68
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:12,536
People like who? Me?

69
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:18,243
Is there something you wanna
tell me, or should I ask Landon?

70
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,045
He seems to know
a lot more than I do.

71
00:05:20,078 --> 00:05:24,015
Not today, Satan. I am
gonna see you both this weekend,

72
00:05:24,049 --> 00:05:26,117
- at the lake house.
- Don't bet on it.

73
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:27,718
- Okay.
- We'll be there.

74
00:05:33,058 --> 00:05:35,659
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

75
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:37,694
When was this
supposed to happen?

76
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:41,299
- A week?
- What? A week?

77
00:05:41,332 --> 00:05:44,035
You're going away in a week,
you haven't even told me?

78
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:47,205
When was I supposed to tell you?
Because you left.

79
00:05:48,406 --> 00:05:50,275
Yeah, I'm here. I came back.

80
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,177
And I came back for you.

81
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,312
I couldn't get a hold
of you for nine days.

82
00:05:54,345 --> 00:05:56,580
I didn't know
if I'd ever see you again.

83
00:05:59,784 --> 00:06:01,319
So, what, is that it then?

84
00:06:02,954 --> 00:06:05,622
I mean...

85
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:10,195
Yeah, this... This job's a huge
opportunity for me. And...

86
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:14,265
And I'm hoping, I was hoping,
that you would come with me.

87
00:06:17,902 --> 00:06:21,773
I was hoping that we could move
to London after graduation.

88
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:26,911
And how was I supposed
to know that?

89
00:06:26,945 --> 00:06:28,379
Well, I was gonna tell you.

90
00:06:28,413 --> 00:06:31,049
But it doesn't really matter
anymore, does it?

91
00:06:31,082 --> 00:06:33,184
You've made up your mind,
you've got a plan.

92
00:06:33,218 --> 00:06:35,120
Envisioned your life in a way
that doesn't have me in it.

93
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:37,388
You are in it,
if you want to be.

94
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:42,693
Look, I get that you're angry.

95
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:44,262
And we do
need to talk about this,

96
00:06:44,295 --> 00:06:46,364
except I have
to get to class, so...

97
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:51,736
We will continue
this discussion.

98
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:53,271
Oh, that's really big of you.

99
00:06:53,304 --> 00:06:56,040
To find time in
your busy schedule. Thank you.

100
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,653
Hey.

101
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:30,008
Hi, Mom, how's London?

102
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,810
Good. I just wanted
to check you're okay.

103
00:07:32,844 --> 00:07:36,281
I heard that Tessa took the job
with Vance, in Seattle.

104
00:07:36,314 --> 00:07:37,749
Where did you hear that?

105
00:07:37,782 --> 00:07:39,851
Christian and I
were talking earlier.

106
00:07:39,884 --> 00:07:41,186
That's kind of weird.

107
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:42,787
He and I have known each other

108
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,289
since long before you were born.

109
00:07:44,322 --> 00:07:46,324
<i>I'd prefer not everyone
knows my business.</i>

110
00:07:46,357 --> 00:07:48,159
Mom, I'm gonna call you back.

111
00:08:08,213 --> 00:08:09,981
Do you need a ride somewhere?

112
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:15,420
Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

113
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,799
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

114
00:08:30,568 --> 00:08:32,237
Hey, you wanna come inside?

115
00:08:35,907 --> 00:08:37,375
Fuck it, why not.

116
00:08:44,048 --> 00:08:45,183
Enjoy.

117
00:08:47,552 --> 00:08:49,220
What are we drinking about?

118
00:08:49,254 --> 00:08:51,956
I didn't know
we needed a reason.

119
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,124
Cheers to that.

120
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,867
Oh, look at her in this one.

121
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,402
Mmm.

122
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,973
She looks really happy.

123
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:13,144
I've really been trying.
Now more than ever.

124
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,946
- Yeah.
- Well...

125
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:18,449
Clearly not right now.
But I am trying.

126
00:09:18,483 --> 00:09:21,286
You know, you really remind me
of me when I was your age.

127
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:23,821
- Fuck that.
- Mmm, yeah.

128
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,424
- Seriously?
- Hey. Hey, buddy.

129
00:09:26,457 --> 00:09:28,426
Private conversation,
if you don't mind.

130
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:30,862
Hey, just trying
to get some ideas.

131
00:09:30,895 --> 00:09:33,031
Whoa!

132
00:09:33,064 --> 00:09:35,366
That is my daughter,
you fucking piece of shit.

133
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,011
Hey.

134
00:09:49,614 --> 00:09:51,316
I'm sorry, who is this?

135
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,585
What are you doing here?

136
00:09:54,619 --> 00:09:57,322
Uh, bonding.

137
00:09:57,355 --> 00:09:58,389
- Hey, Tess.
- Hardin...

138
00:10:00,358 --> 00:10:01,893
What the hell did you do?

139
00:10:01,926 --> 00:10:04,562
- I didn't do any...
- The bartender called me.

140
00:10:04,595 --> 00:10:06,597
Oh, come on.
It wasn't a big deal.

141
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:09,867
- Look, he's fine.
- You're drunk.

142
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,969
I had a drink. I just...
Look, it was...

143
00:10:12,003 --> 00:10:13,471
- I was backing up your dad.
- Really?

144
00:10:13,504 --> 00:10:15,973
I didn't start...
He started it actually, so...

145
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:17,342
Somebody called the cops.

146
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,177
You probably called the cops,
you snitch.

147
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,079
Okay, let's go.

148
00:10:21,112 --> 00:10:23,081
Don't be mad at him.

149
00:10:23,114 --> 00:10:24,382
He loves you.

150
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,118
That's all.

151
00:10:28,619 --> 00:10:30,455
Whoa!

152
00:10:30,488 --> 00:10:35,960
Yeah, you see that?
Solid guy right there.

153
00:10:35,993 --> 00:10:38,196
- Why would anyone leave you?
- I don't know.

154
00:10:38,229 --> 00:10:40,298
Yeah, this is just...
It's so enjoyable.

155
00:10:40,331 --> 00:10:42,600
Why wouldn't I stay?

156
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:44,035
I think we're in trouble.

157
00:10:44,068 --> 00:10:46,204
Hey, hey, hey, easy.

158
00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:21,672
You know, I'm not sure
that I like this new friendship.

159
00:11:21,706 --> 00:11:24,142
I was just trying to be nice.

160
00:11:24,175 --> 00:11:26,944
I offered him a ride, and
the bar was actually his idea.

161
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,947
He's an alcoholic,
and so are you.

162
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,285
Two alcoholics walk into a bar.

163
00:11:39,257 --> 00:11:41,392
I'm glad
you think this is funny.

164
00:11:41,426 --> 00:11:44,061
I was showing him some
pictures of you on my phone,

165
00:11:44,095 --> 00:11:45,463
and this asshole leans over

166
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,965
and starts saying
what he'd like to do to you.

167
00:11:50,736 --> 00:11:53,104
So... I mean, so?

168
00:11:53,137 --> 00:11:55,406
So I told him
I've already done that.

169
00:12:17,328 --> 00:12:19,297
- Hardin...
- What?

170
00:12:23,334 --> 00:12:25,169
I'm apologizing.

171
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,028
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:52,296 --> 00:12:54,065
I'm so sorry.

173
00:12:59,103 --> 00:13:01,706
- Please forgive me.
- I, that's...

174
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:06,511
- That's not fair.
- Please forgive me.

175
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:09,647
- What if...?
- Shh, he's asleep.

176
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:43,481
Tessa.

177
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:46,250
Oh, Tessa.

178
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,097
Oh, fuck...

179
00:14:17,448 --> 00:14:21,319
So, uh, I heard
you guys are moving.

180
00:14:21,352 --> 00:14:24,322
Yeah, yeah. I actually need
to start packing.

181
00:14:24,355 --> 00:14:26,691
I'll just finish up
and get out of here.

182
00:14:26,724 --> 00:14:28,559
No, no, no.
No, I didn't mean it like...

183
00:14:28,593 --> 00:14:30,762
Nah, nah.
You don't need me around here.

184
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:33,431
I'll just... I got
a few errands to run anyway.

185
00:14:33,464 --> 00:14:34,833
Dad...

186
00:14:38,904 --> 00:14:40,772
That feels really weird to say.

187
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:45,844
Well, that'll be my ride.

188
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:49,781
You're leaving now?

189
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,918
Yeah.

190
00:14:52,951 --> 00:14:54,151
Come here.

191
00:14:56,788 --> 00:14:59,123
Thank you so much
for letting me stay.

192
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,694
No, stay, stay. He's coming.

193
00:15:05,831 --> 00:15:07,565
Uh, hey, don't...

194
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:13,304
Don't disappear on me again.

195
00:15:21,312 --> 00:15:22,413
Hardin.

196
00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:31,656
So you shipping me out next?

197
00:15:37,528 --> 00:15:39,563
- You okay?
- You know, it's not like

198
00:15:39,597 --> 00:15:40,899
I want to leave you.

199
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:43,769
You don't have to.

200
00:15:46,004 --> 00:15:49,440
Vance's offer, it's literally...
It's a dream come true.

201
00:15:49,473 --> 00:15:51,777
I've wanted to live in Seattle
since I was a kid.

202
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,745
The only thing
that would make it better

203
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:55,613
is if you came with me.

204
00:15:55,646 --> 00:15:58,582
I don't... I don't know
why you want me there.

205
00:16:00,384 --> 00:16:02,653
I don't really fit
into that flashy lifestyle.

206
00:16:02,687 --> 00:16:04,823
It's never been the kind of
thing you've been after...

207
00:16:04,856 --> 00:16:06,925
- I want to make a life together.
- So do I.

208
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,492
So stay here, and we can.

209
00:16:08,526 --> 00:16:10,294
- You're not listening.
- I am listening.

210
00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:12,363
- I've wanted this job since I...
- I know.

211
00:16:12,396 --> 00:16:14,900
You have a great job in Seattle.
That is great.

212
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,736
I'm happy for you. But I don't.
I don't have anything there.

213
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,337
- You'd have me.
- Okay, that's not enough.

214
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:27,311
You know I didn't mean that.

215
00:16:31,682 --> 00:16:33,584
Well, if I'm...

216
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:37,254
If I'm not enough, that's...
That's your problem.

217
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,857
But you're not gonna stop me.

218
00:17:25,436 --> 00:17:27,304
Vance Publishing, please hold.

219
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,974
No, I can't. I'm swamped.

220
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,842
You're gonna have to speak
to my assistant.

221
00:17:30,876 --> 00:17:32,710
No, the new one.

222
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,014
Um, well, I'll try
and squeeze you in

223
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:37,983
for 30 minutes this afternoon.

224
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,785
Tessa! Hey, come in.

225
00:17:39,818 --> 00:17:42,087
- I can come back.
- No, no. Come in. I'm just...

226
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,855
- I'm heading out.
- Yeah.

227
00:17:43,889 --> 00:17:47,959
- Um, you have a safe trip.
- Okay. See you.

228
00:17:49,728 --> 00:17:52,630
Are you sure that you're okay
driving up by yourself?

229
00:17:52,663 --> 00:17:55,066
- She's not going by herself.
- I'm taking Smith with me.

230
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,471
Besides, I prefer to get us
settled up there

231
00:18:00,504 --> 00:18:03,440
while Christian
finishes things here.

232
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:05,811
Have you decided what part
of town you'll be staying in?

233
00:18:05,844 --> 00:18:08,412
No, I'm still deciding
between two places.

234
00:18:08,445 --> 00:18:10,849
It's scary trying to pick
somewhere off the internet.

235
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:12,683
No, Tessa. Just stay with us.

236
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,052
You know,
until you get situated.

237
00:18:14,085 --> 00:18:15,653
No, no. I couldn't ask...

238
00:18:15,686 --> 00:18:19,024
You didn't.
Come on, it'll be fun.

239
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,558
Christian will be thrilled.

240
00:18:20,591 --> 00:18:22,994
He's been dying
to spend time with Hardin.

241
00:18:23,028 --> 00:18:26,731
Uh, well, he's actually
not coming with me.

242
00:18:26,765 --> 00:18:28,967
Oh.

243
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,335
Well, when he comes
to visit, then.

244
00:18:34,806 --> 00:18:38,143
You know, between us,

245
00:18:38,176 --> 00:18:40,979
Christian was disappointed
Hardin turned him down

246
00:18:41,012 --> 00:18:42,881
on his job offer.

247
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:46,550
What... What job was that?

248
00:18:47,886 --> 00:18:50,421
Basically, anything he wanted.

249
00:19:05,569 --> 00:19:06,872
Hey.

250
00:19:06,905 --> 00:19:09,007
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't walk away from me.

251
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,508
- Hey, don't follow me.
- Tess, I'm sorry.

252
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:13,644
I didn't mean it.
I shouldn't have said it.

253
00:19:13,677 --> 00:19:15,713
Can you stop saying things
you don't mean?

254
00:19:15,747 --> 00:19:17,182
I can't tell what's true.

255
00:19:17,215 --> 00:19:18,917
Can you stop making decisions

256
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,852
without talking things
through first?

257
00:19:22,854 --> 00:19:24,022
Okay.

258
00:19:25,924 --> 00:19:27,625
Okay.

259
00:19:27,658 --> 00:19:30,661
Kimberly invited me to stay
with them in Seattle,

260
00:19:30,694 --> 00:19:32,831
- if that's not weird?
- Did she?

261
00:19:32,864 --> 00:19:34,833
No, no, no. It's not weird.

262
00:19:34,866 --> 00:19:36,935
It's good. It's great.

263
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:40,005
Vance is always gone,
so I think it'll be a win-win.

264
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:41,405
Yeah.

265
00:19:43,574 --> 00:19:46,443
How do you think they make
that work, the long-distance?

266
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,412
I don't know, they communicate?

267
00:19:49,915 --> 00:19:52,918
Heh, wait, wait, wait.
What was that?

268
00:19:52,951 --> 00:19:55,653
- What?
- The thing underneath the thing

269
00:19:55,686 --> 00:19:58,223
that you just said.

270
00:19:58,256 --> 00:19:59,791
Why didn't you tell me

271
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:02,626
that Vance offered you
a job in Seattle?

272
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,195
Because I wasn't gonna take it.

273
00:20:04,229 --> 00:20:07,098
But why didn't you tell me
that you weren't gonna take it?

274
00:20:07,132 --> 00:20:09,134
Here I am,
begging you to come with me,

275
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:11,903
- just to find out that...
- He kept on harping on me.

276
00:20:11,937 --> 00:20:13,972
It wasn't something
I wanted to deal with.

277
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,875
Remember, at the time,
I had no idea you were going.

278
00:20:18,276 --> 00:20:20,045
We do need to stop

279
00:20:20,078 --> 00:20:21,980
keeping secrets from each other.

280
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:25,784
Agreed.

281
00:20:44,803 --> 00:20:46,738
We'll have fun
this weekend, okay?

282
00:20:47,806 --> 00:20:48,940
Okay.

283
00:21:07,092 --> 00:21:08,126
You look like Popeye.

284
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:14,199
- A very sexy Popeye, come on.
- Get up, we're gonna be late.

285
00:21:19,204 --> 00:21:21,306
We could've just met you there,
couldn't we?

286
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:23,008
Why did we have to
all come together?

287
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,576
- We could've made our own way.
- It's a long drive.

288
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:26,945
And this way, we get to have

289
00:21:26,978 --> 00:21:29,546
some very much needed
family time.

290
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,547
Yeah.

291
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:31,916
Much needed, great.

292
00:21:33,018 --> 00:21:34,819
You're lucky I love you.

293
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:39,891
Okay, I spy with my little eye

294
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,126
something black.

295
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:44,295
Black. Easy, Hardin's soul.

296
00:21:44,329 --> 00:21:45,964
- Oh, yeah, ha-ha!
- Hey!

297
00:21:45,997 --> 00:21:47,198
- Come on, boys!
- That's why.

298
00:21:47,232 --> 00:21:49,067
- Boys...
- That's why your soul is black.

299
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,935
Hey, don't touch this!

300
00:22:13,925 --> 00:22:15,126
Shut up!

301
00:22:33,945 --> 00:22:36,047
Are you still going to New York?

302
00:22:36,081 --> 00:22:40,819
Yeah, I've got everything set up
at NYU, so I'm just gonna...

303
00:22:40,852 --> 00:22:43,288
I guess, go with the flow,
you know?

304
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:47,058
Mmm. I need
to get better at that.

305
00:22:47,092 --> 00:22:50,728
Are you having...
You having second thoughts?

306
00:22:50,762 --> 00:22:53,798
And third and fourth
and fifth and...

307
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:56,935
I don't know. I'm just worried
that I made the wrong decision.

308
00:22:56,968 --> 00:23:00,671
- Tess...
- It's just, apparently...

309
00:23:00,704 --> 00:23:05,143
Hardin wanted me to go England
with him after graduation.

310
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:07,979
And I don't know.
Maybe I should.

311
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:10,714
You've been
gushing about Seattle

312
00:23:10,748 --> 00:23:12,383
since the day I first met you.

313
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:13,952
Why stray from your path?

314
00:23:15,253 --> 00:23:18,156
- Go with the flow?
- No, no.

315
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,959
Cop-out. That's not you.
That's me.

316
00:23:20,992 --> 00:23:22,794
You have to do you.

317
00:23:22,827 --> 00:23:25,029
Yeah, and what about him?

318
00:23:25,063 --> 00:23:28,233
What about him?
Mr. Grumpy? He's...

319
00:23:28,266 --> 00:23:32,103
If he loves you, he could...

320
00:23:32,137 --> 00:23:33,838
follow you.
I'm just saying.

321
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:37,075
Ooh! Wow.

322
00:23:37,108 --> 00:23:39,744
Mm, some hard truth.
It's tough love.

323
00:23:39,777 --> 00:23:42,881
- I'm gonna need more wine.
- Good luck.

324
00:23:46,451 --> 00:23:48,853
See? Did you see...?

325
00:24:16,381 --> 00:24:18,183
I don't want to lose this.

326
00:24:21,352 --> 00:24:22,887
I don't either.

327
00:24:26,491 --> 00:24:29,160
But, "If adventures
will not befall

328
00:24:29,194 --> 00:24:32,263
a young lady in her own village,
she must seek them abroad."

329
00:24:33,831 --> 00:24:35,500
But, "There is nothing
like staying

330
00:24:35,533 --> 00:24:37,035
at home for real comfort."

331
00:24:38,369 --> 00:24:39,938
"You pierce my soul.

332
00:24:39,971 --> 00:24:42,207
I'm half agony, half hope."

333
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,209
"We are all fools in love."

334
00:24:47,345 --> 00:24:48,846
I thought you were Darcy.

335
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,182
And you've just been
Jane Austen the whole time.

336
00:24:59,557 --> 00:25:02,126
So are you gonna show me
what you're writing there?

337
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,862
I... Maybe.

338
00:25:04,896 --> 00:25:05,830
Someday.

339
00:25:09,067 --> 00:25:10,401
Someday.

340
00:25:16,908 --> 00:25:21,346
- Reservation for Scott.
- Yes, Mr. Scott. Right this way.

341
00:25:29,387 --> 00:25:32,457
- Thank you.
- Hardin?

342
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:36,494
- Ha! Hey, Lilly. How are you?
- Mm!

343
00:25:36,527 --> 00:25:38,830
- How are you?
- No fucking way.

344
00:25:38,863 --> 00:25:40,898
- Long time, huh?
- It's been forever.

345
00:25:40,932 --> 00:25:43,968
- This is Tessa. Tessa, Lillian.
- Hi.

346
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:45,503
Nice dress.

347
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,942
I'll be over in a second.

348
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:58,449
I might get something
different, but...

349
00:25:58,483 --> 00:26:00,084
Really?

350
00:26:00,118 --> 00:26:01,919
Crab cakes.

351
00:26:01,953 --> 00:26:04,489
- Good evening, folks.
- Yes. Good evening.

352
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:06,557
I'm Robert. I'll be
taking care of you tonight.

353
00:26:06,591 --> 00:26:08,926
Can I get you started
with a round of drinks?

354
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,929
Yeah. I think we'll do
a bottle of Cab for the table.

355
00:26:11,963 --> 00:26:14,832
- And some water for us.
- I think we're ready to order.

356
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:17,835
- Great, what'll it be?
- You're gonna get the...

357
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:20,505
- Crab cakes.
- Yes. And I'm gonna get the...

358
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:22,240
- fish and chips.
- Fish and chips.

359
00:26:22,273 --> 00:26:24,575
And also, we would
like to get a sablefish

360
00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:26,411
for after the meal to take home.

361
00:26:26,444 --> 00:26:28,012
That's a good choice.

362
00:26:29,514 --> 00:26:31,883
- And for you?
- Um, is there anything

363
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:33,584
that you'd recommend?

364
00:26:33,618 --> 00:26:37,088
The cedar-planked salmon
is our specialty.

365
00:26:37,121 --> 00:26:40,925
Okay. I'm more into like pasta?

366
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:43,194
Carbs, yeah. I love carbs.

367
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:46,431
Um, we have
a squid-ink spaghetti.

368
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:49,167
Um, it was lovely to see you

369
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,170
and to meet you guys,
but I'll have to go. Sorry.

370
00:26:52,203 --> 00:26:55,206
Too fancy. How about we
whip you up something special?

371
00:26:58,042 --> 00:26:59,844
Yeah, okay. Thank you.

372
00:27:01,312 --> 00:27:03,414
Can I get you anything,
or do you need a minute?

373
00:27:03,448 --> 00:27:05,983
Yeah, you can come back.

374
00:27:06,017 --> 00:27:07,251
Robert.

375
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,955
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you, Robert.

376
00:27:10,988 --> 00:27:12,256
Thank you.

377
00:27:18,396 --> 00:27:19,897
Alone at last.

378
00:27:22,066 --> 00:27:23,634
Ooh!

379
00:27:23,668 --> 00:27:25,236
That's good.

380
00:27:29,707 --> 00:27:33,311
Come on, before they get home.

381
00:27:37,582 --> 00:27:38,916
Ow, ow!

382
00:27:44,589 --> 00:27:47,492
I really hope they're having
more than one cocktail.

383
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,662
You do kind of like it, though.

384
00:27:51,696 --> 00:27:53,498
The thrill of being caught.

385
00:28:01,439 --> 00:28:03,174
Oh, that's nice.

386
00:28:38,576 --> 00:28:39,677
Trust me.

387
00:30:55,747 --> 00:30:58,516
I really wish you
were coming to Seattle.

388
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:05,556
- Can I ask you a question?
- Mmm.

389
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,492
Does your moving to Seattle
have anything to do with Trevor?

390
00:31:12,463 --> 00:31:18,402
No. No. I mean...
we barely even talk anymore.

391
00:31:24,241 --> 00:31:26,110
Did you ever
have feelings for him?

392
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:29,647
- That's two questions.
- Tess, be honest.

393
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:41,592
Uh, there was a moment when...

394
00:31:43,294 --> 00:31:46,798
Hey! Seriously?
That's not fair!

395
00:31:48,332 --> 00:31:49,634
Hardin!

396
00:31:57,776 --> 00:31:59,710
<i>Leave a message.</i>

397
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,582
Hey, where are you?
Can you give me a call back?

398
00:32:41,719 --> 00:32:45,356
- Robert.
- Right. Um, Tessa.

399
00:32:45,389 --> 00:32:46,925
So, what are you doing
out here?

400
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:52,831
I had a fight with my...

401
00:32:52,864 --> 00:32:55,000
It's complicated.

402
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:58,536
Well, a few of us are doing
after hours, if you wanna join.

403
00:32:58,569 --> 00:33:00,739
- Um, yeah.
- Yeah?

404
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:02,239
- Yeah.
- Okay.

405
00:33:03,708 --> 00:33:05,977
Heh, you probably
should've worn a coat.

406
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:13,651
- So you live here, right?
- Born and raised.

407
00:33:13,684 --> 00:33:16,287
But I actually just got
into med school.

408
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,790
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah, so just working here,

409
00:33:18,824 --> 00:33:19,858
saving up till then.

410
00:33:19,891 --> 00:33:21,726
- Wow, congratulations.
- Thanks.

411
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,394
Where are you going?

412
00:33:23,427 --> 00:33:24,830
UW was my dream,

413
00:33:24,863 --> 00:33:26,932
but Mount Sinai gave me
a scholarship

414
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:30,301
- I couldn't pass up, so...
- Mount Sinai is in...?

415
00:33:30,334 --> 00:33:31,870
- NYC.
- Okay.

416
00:33:31,903 --> 00:33:33,872
New York City.
You've heard of it.

417
00:33:33,905 --> 00:33:35,606
The Big Apple, you know?

418
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,576
And Nora, actually, Nora and I
went to undergrad together

419
00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:41,712
and then she moved out there,
so I'll know someone.

420
00:33:41,747 --> 00:33:43,614
Talking shit? Yeah?

421
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:45,616
She's already got
the New York attitude.

422
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:48,385
- Tess. Hey.
- Hey! Hey.

423
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:50,654
Okay, so this is Robert,
and this is Nora.

424
00:33:50,688 --> 00:33:53,724
Yes, there will be a test
afterwards.

425
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:55,827
And they both live in New York.

426
00:33:55,861 --> 00:33:57,763
Thank you.

427
00:33:57,796 --> 00:33:59,798
In New York? Pleasure.

428
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:02,333
Hey! What? Oh, my God!

429
00:34:03,534 --> 00:34:05,871
How are you?
It's been...

430
00:34:05,904 --> 00:34:08,606
- You remember Robert, right?
- Yeah.

431
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,442
I remember Robert. I'll do
an old fashioned, actually.

432
00:34:11,475 --> 00:34:13,044
Oh. I'm off, actually.

433
00:34:13,078 --> 00:34:15,814
You're still wearing your
name tag and your uniform, so...

434
00:34:18,415 --> 00:34:20,886
So I heard
that you're moving to Seattle.

435
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:23,654
Yeah, um, I'm actually
transferring for work.

436
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,723
Ah, I'm jealous.

437
00:34:25,757 --> 00:34:27,625
I'd much rather be
in Seattle than New York.

438
00:34:27,658 --> 00:34:29,660
I keep telling Hardin
he should give it a shot.

439
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:32,596
- It's not for me.
- No, it's not for him.

440
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,732
- It's the best.
- It's the best.

441
00:34:33,765 --> 00:34:35,399
It is, yeah.
My girlfriend and I,

442
00:34:35,432 --> 00:34:37,803
we've lived in Capitol Hill
for a few years now.

443
00:34:37,836 --> 00:34:41,372
- Oh, your girlfriend?
- Yeah, my girlfriend, Riley.

444
00:34:41,405 --> 00:34:43,707
We should probably leave now.

445
00:34:43,742 --> 00:34:46,677
I don't really
wanna go just yet.

446
00:34:49,413 --> 00:34:50,949
I'm gonna head home.

447
00:34:55,954 --> 00:34:57,555
Let me walk you out.

448
00:35:03,962 --> 00:35:07,464
- I'm really sorry about all of...
- You don't have to apologize.

449
00:35:07,498 --> 00:35:08,834
Sorry.

450
00:35:08,867 --> 00:35:11,102
Sorry. Heh!

451
00:35:11,136 --> 00:35:12,971
I don't know why I do that.

452
00:35:14,505 --> 00:35:16,707
I could guess, but I won't.

453
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,015
Um, it was nice meeting you.

454
00:35:24,049 --> 00:35:26,617
You too.

455
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:28,019
And thanks for...

456
00:35:29,888 --> 00:35:30,889
Mm-hm.

457
00:35:33,992 --> 00:35:35,994
I'm not expecting anything,

458
00:35:36,027 --> 00:35:40,065
but if someday you find
yourself in the city...

459
00:35:42,901 --> 00:35:46,104
give me a call. Or don't.

460
00:35:46,137 --> 00:35:47,739
It's up to you.

461
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,862
Hey.

462
00:36:10,896 --> 00:36:12,931
Hey.

463
00:36:12,964 --> 00:36:14,065
Morning.

464
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,642
- What's that face?
- How was... How was last night?

465
00:36:24,675 --> 00:36:27,711
Oh, it was good. It was...
It was fine.

466
00:36:27,746 --> 00:36:29,080
Nora's nice. She's, uh...

467
00:36:29,114 --> 00:36:31,850
She's kind of a big deal
on the restaurant scene,

468
00:36:31,883 --> 00:36:34,551
so she's gonna show me around
when I get to New York.

469
00:36:34,585 --> 00:36:37,454
- That's really convenient.
- It's all about... Heh-heh.

470
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,827
How was...
How was the hot tub?

471
00:37:10,989 --> 00:37:12,489
Guess what Landon found.

472
00:37:25,303 --> 00:37:28,706
I thought that we were gonna be
more open with each other.

473
00:37:34,846 --> 00:37:36,748
So did I.

474
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:39,650
I didn't ask for his number.
He just gave it to me. It...

475
00:37:39,683 --> 00:37:42,586
No. I just found another
guy's number in your things.

476
00:37:44,122 --> 00:37:47,691
You made it look like you were
with Lillian last night.

477
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:49,728
- Lillian's my friend.
- So is he.

478
00:37:49,761 --> 00:37:51,796
You guys just met.
How could you be friends?

479
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:55,066
You do this. You sabotage
every good moment that we have.

480
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,701
No. If I wanted to try
and sabotage a good moment,

481
00:37:57,736 --> 00:37:59,738
I would have brought
up your moment with Trevor,

482
00:37:59,771 --> 00:38:02,107
- but I'll do one at a time.
- Why can't you let things be?

483
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,641
- Like, let us be happy for once.
- Tess, you must admit,

484
00:38:04,675 --> 00:38:07,278
if I were moving away
with an admitted love interest,

485
00:38:07,312 --> 00:38:09,848
- you'd have feelings about that.
- Love interest?

486
00:38:09,881 --> 00:38:11,816
We're friends. From work.

487
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,752
You don't get to choose
who I have as friends.

488
00:38:13,785 --> 00:38:15,987
They don't wanna
be your fucking friends!

489
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:17,922
Then why can't you
just trust me?

490
00:38:17,956 --> 00:38:20,091
I do trust you.
It's them I don't trust.

491
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:21,658
No, you don't.

492
00:38:21,692 --> 00:38:23,762
You don't trust me.
You don't trust anyone.

493
00:38:23,795 --> 00:38:24,963
You just control them.

494
00:38:30,201 --> 00:38:33,938
Is this really about them,
or is this about me moving?

495
00:38:33,972 --> 00:38:36,941
The irony is, I got you
the damn job in the first place.

496
00:38:36,975 --> 00:38:40,677
I mean, I might have had
something to do with it.

497
00:38:40,711 --> 00:38:42,679
Tess, how many freshmen
do you know

498
00:38:42,713 --> 00:38:44,282
with jobs
at top publishing firms,

499
00:38:44,315 --> 00:38:47,584
their transfer's taken care of,
places to live, how many?

500
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:50,687
Wow.

501
00:38:50,721 --> 00:38:53,058
This honesty thing's
really paying off for us.

502
00:38:53,091 --> 00:38:54,725
So I won't...

503
00:38:54,759 --> 00:38:58,029
I won't give up Seattle for
you, so you just turn on me?

504
00:39:00,765 --> 00:39:03,068
There is a big difference
between not being able

505
00:39:03,101 --> 00:39:05,070
to live without someone
and loving them.

506
00:39:21,386 --> 00:39:24,322
He is scared of losing you.
He loves you.

507
00:39:24,355 --> 00:39:27,992
He knows you're the best thing
that's ever happened to him.

508
00:39:28,026 --> 00:39:31,229
- Well...
- No, Tessa, it's true.

509
00:39:31,262 --> 00:39:34,732
You've changed his life.
He knows it.

510
00:39:34,766 --> 00:39:36,000
We all know it.

511
00:39:37,202 --> 00:39:40,105
You stay in touch. Okay.

512
00:39:40,138 --> 00:39:41,638
Bye.

513
00:40:42,467 --> 00:40:44,836
She's gonna thrive
up there, man.

514
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:46,437
What, and that's a bad thing?

515
00:40:48,473 --> 00:40:52,010
This is a big step for her.
You should be happy for her.

516
00:40:52,043 --> 00:40:53,278
I am.

517
00:40:56,114 --> 00:40:57,714
I am happy.

518
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:07,959
You could come with her.
I've got loads of work for you...

519
00:41:07,992 --> 00:41:10,261
- I don't wanna do that.
- You'd get great benefits.

520
00:41:10,295 --> 00:41:12,363
I don't want your handouts.

521
00:41:12,397 --> 00:41:14,199
I'm sorry, I...

522
00:41:14,232 --> 00:41:17,101
They're the reason I'm here,
and I don't want any more help.

523
00:41:18,403 --> 00:41:20,905
Tessa didn't get a favor.

524
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:22,740
She's excellent.

525
00:41:22,774 --> 00:41:24,209
She earned this position.

526
00:41:27,011 --> 00:41:28,446
She does deserve it.

527
00:41:31,249 --> 00:41:33,384
I'm sure she'll do smashingly.

528
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,868
Tessa?

529
00:41:55,206 --> 00:41:56,407
Tess?

530
00:42:00,111 --> 00:42:02,180
Tess?

531
00:43:14,152 --> 00:43:15,219
<i>Pain.</i>

532
00:43:15,253 --> 00:43:16,387
<i>Lately, I've become</i>

533
00:43:16,421 --> 00:43:18,489
<i>very well acquainted with it.</i>

534
00:43:18,523 --> 00:43:21,926
<i>The slow and steady
aching pain,</i>

535
00:43:21,959 --> 00:43:24,429
<i>the type that comes when
you've been hurt repeatedly</i>

536
00:43:24,462 --> 00:43:26,197
<i>by the same person.</i>

537
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:35,206
<i>You finally breathe,</i>

538
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:37,975
<i>thinking that yesterday's
problem will stay in the past</i>

539
00:43:38,009 --> 00:43:41,079
<i>when, in fact,
it's today's problem,</i>

540
00:43:41,112 --> 00:43:42,413
<i>tomorrow's problem,</i>

541
00:43:42,447 --> 00:43:44,949
<i>and the problem
of every day after that.</i>

542
00:43:49,387 --> 00:43:52,990
<i>Only in those rare moments
when he pulls me to his chest</i>

543
00:43:53,024 --> 00:43:55,626
<i>and makes promises
he never seems able to keep</i>

544
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:57,562
<i>does the pain disappear.</i>

545
00:44:07,271 --> 00:44:09,107
Shit. She looks upset.

546
00:44:11,075 --> 00:44:12,443
- Hey!
- Hey!

547
00:44:14,112 --> 00:44:15,646
Let me take that
for you upstairs.

548
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,081
Oh, thanks.

549
00:44:19,384 --> 00:44:21,652
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

550
00:44:23,621 --> 00:44:25,957
Well, you look...

551
00:44:28,393 --> 00:44:29,627
...terrible.

552
00:44:31,362 --> 00:44:32,497
Come here.

553
00:45:10,134 --> 00:45:11,402
Oh, uh, excuse me.

554
00:45:11,436 --> 00:45:13,604
Do you guys know
where Bagley Hall is?

555
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:41,359
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey.

556
00:46:41,392 --> 00:46:43,194
<i>Hey. What's going on?</i>

557
00:46:43,227 --> 00:46:44,763
<i>Hardin, come back here!</i>

558
00:47:01,847 --> 00:47:04,282
Tess, wait. Don't hang up.
That was Iskra, my trainer.

559
00:47:04,315 --> 00:47:06,350
- I'm at the gym.
- I'm kicking his ass, Tess!

560
00:47:06,384 --> 00:47:08,486
And he is not kicking my ass.

561
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:10,822
I didn't mean to hang up.

562
00:47:10,856 --> 00:47:12,824
I think you did,
and I know exactly why,

563
00:47:12,858 --> 00:47:16,494
'cause I would have
thought the same thing.

564
00:47:16,527 --> 00:47:19,363
Yeah, I'm a little relieved.

565
00:47:19,397 --> 00:47:21,532
It's nice,
showing Landon the ropes.

566
00:47:23,134 --> 00:47:24,535
<i>Don't take all day.</i>

567
00:47:24,569 --> 00:47:25,503
<i>Okay, one minute.</i>

568
00:47:27,773 --> 00:47:29,106
You okay, though?

569
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,576
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

570
00:47:31,609 --> 00:47:33,377
How was the drive down?
Was it not too long?

571
00:47:33,411 --> 00:47:35,613
<i>It was good, but when
you get in the city,</i>

572
00:47:35,646 --> 00:47:37,548
<i>the traffic's terrible.</i>

573
00:47:37,582 --> 00:47:39,851
It takes like 20 minutes
to go a mile.

574
00:47:41,586 --> 00:47:42,854
And Vance and Kimberly's?

575
00:47:42,888 --> 00:47:44,388
Yeah, yeah, it's great.

576
00:47:44,422 --> 00:47:46,457
The, um...
The place is amazing.

577
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:48,359
It's like...

578
00:47:48,392 --> 00:47:50,595
It's huge. It's like a palace.

579
00:47:50,628 --> 00:47:51,730
Nice.

580
00:47:52,898 --> 00:47:55,499
<i>I'm really glad, Tess.</i>

581
00:47:58,235 --> 00:48:00,404
- I'm sorry I hurt you.
- <i>You don't...</i>

582
00:48:00,438 --> 00:48:02,473
No, I...

583
00:48:04,275 --> 00:48:05,911
I just want you to be happy.

584
00:48:05,944 --> 00:48:07,411
You deserve to be happy.

585
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:11,182
It's cool that you're boxing.

586
00:48:11,215 --> 00:48:13,919
I know, right?
I really fucking like it.

587
00:48:13,952 --> 00:48:15,754
It's nice to be able
to punch people

588
00:48:15,787 --> 00:48:17,288
and not have anyone
call the police.

589
00:48:19,523 --> 00:48:21,860
I think that
that's a step forward.

590
00:48:23,494 --> 00:48:24,896
Right?

591
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:27,598
I'm trying a new approach.

592
00:48:27,632 --> 00:48:29,667
Hardin. This is not
leisure hour. Come on.

593
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,370
I really have to go now,
but I'm so glad you called.

594
00:48:32,403 --> 00:48:34,438
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

595
00:48:34,472 --> 00:48:35,907
All right. We'll talk soon.

596
00:48:35,941 --> 00:48:38,275
- <i>Bye, Tess.</i>
- Bye.

597
00:48:49,855 --> 00:48:53,190
- Yes.
- He's a pretty boy.

598
00:48:53,224 --> 00:48:55,861
You scared to fight Landon?
You heard... Oh, shit!

599
00:48:55,894 --> 00:48:57,528
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

600
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,908
Vance Publishing, please hold.

601
00:49:15,981 --> 00:49:17,983
Selfies, huh?

602
00:49:18,016 --> 00:49:22,954
No, I was... I was just
showing Hardin my new office.

603
00:49:22,988 --> 00:49:24,622
Mm-hm.

604
00:49:26,825 --> 00:49:28,626
Seattle looks good on you.

605
00:49:44,709 --> 00:49:47,344
So how's it going?

606
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:52,818
Fine. Yeah.
I mean, work, school.

607
00:49:52,851 --> 00:49:55,453
It's a lot, but it's fine.

608
00:49:55,486 --> 00:49:57,688
Give it time. You'll settle in.

609
00:49:57,722 --> 00:50:00,624
You'll find a place.
It's exciting.

610
00:50:00,658 --> 00:50:02,828
Are you sure
that you don't want a glass?

611
00:50:04,562 --> 00:50:07,766
I think she might be
on to us, darling.

612
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:13,004
Well, we have some news.

613
00:50:13,038 --> 00:50:14,840
We just found out...

614
00:50:14,873 --> 00:50:16,674
we're having a baby.

615
00:50:16,707 --> 00:50:20,311
Are you kidding?
I'm so happy for you guys.

616
00:50:20,344 --> 00:50:22,680
I'm gonna tell Hardin though,
if that's all right with you.

617
00:50:22,713 --> 00:50:24,015
Yeah, yeah, of course.

618
00:50:24,049 --> 00:50:25,716
Ken mentioned that he'd managed

619
00:50:25,751 --> 00:50:28,385
to get his GPA up to a 4.0.

620
00:50:28,419 --> 00:50:30,488
He must be looking forward
to graduating.

621
00:50:30,521 --> 00:50:35,426
Yeah, that's great.
Um, I didn't even know that.

622
00:50:35,459 --> 00:50:36,560
It's because of you.

623
00:50:38,329 --> 00:50:40,065
I mean,
I didn't write his papers.

624
00:50:40,098 --> 00:50:43,701
No, well...
Maybe not, I'm sure he did that.

625
00:50:43,735 --> 00:50:46,071
But, well, he has got
a gift, that boy.

626
00:50:46,104 --> 00:50:47,571
But he's stubborn as hell.

627
00:50:47,605 --> 00:50:48,840
You're one to talk.

628
00:50:49,941 --> 00:50:51,843
Touché.

629
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,948
Well, I should get some sleep,

630
00:50:56,982 --> 00:50:58,784
but I will see
you guys tomorrow?

631
00:50:58,817 --> 00:51:00,752
Yeah, of course.

632
00:51:00,786 --> 00:51:02,854
And you should take this.

633
00:51:02,888 --> 00:51:04,823
It's too nice of a bottle
to go to waste.

634
00:51:04,856 --> 00:51:06,590
- Yes, please.
- Don't worry about me.

635
00:51:06,624 --> 00:51:07,993
I won't have any.

636
00:51:08,026 --> 00:51:10,561
- You don't need any more.
- Good night, darling.

637
00:51:10,594 --> 00:51:12,530
- Good night.
- You have to suffer like me.

638
00:51:17,769 --> 00:51:21,405
There you are.
I just got back from the gym.

639
00:51:21,438 --> 00:51:22,874
<i>You did?</i>

640
00:51:22,908 --> 00:51:27,611
Wow, you must be getting
pretty good.

641
00:51:29,848 --> 00:51:31,116
Are you drunk?

642
00:51:31,149 --> 00:51:33,384
I was hanging out
with Vance and Kimberly,

643
00:51:33,417 --> 00:51:36,687
and she gave me
the rest of the bottle.

644
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,856
Oh, yeah?

645
00:51:37,889 --> 00:51:39,925
So how much wine have you had?

646
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:43,061
I'm on my...

647
00:51:43,094 --> 00:51:44,562
third?

648
00:51:44,595 --> 00:51:49,734
<i>You were actually
quite the topic.</i>

649
00:51:49,768 --> 00:51:51,669
You didn't answer
my call earlier.

650
00:51:51,702 --> 00:51:55,539
<i>No, I know. I've been at work
since, like, 8:00.</i>

651
00:51:55,573 --> 00:51:57,042
Except for taking
office selfies.

652
00:51:57,075 --> 00:52:00,611
- Which you didn't respond to.
- Tessa.

653
00:52:00,644 --> 00:52:02,646
Hardin Allen Scott.

654
00:52:04,481 --> 00:52:05,750
Why are you laughing?

655
00:52:05,784 --> 00:52:08,019
It's just all so ridiculous.

656
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,756
I think you need
to put that wine down.

657
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:13,624
Make me.

658
00:52:13,657 --> 00:52:15,526
Well, I would if I was there.

659
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:17,963
<i>What else would you make me do?</i>

660
00:52:19,164 --> 00:52:20,664
<i>Theresa Lynn Young,</i>

661
00:52:20,698 --> 00:52:23,068
are you trying
to have phone sex with me?

662
00:52:25,203 --> 00:52:27,739
Tell me what you would do
if you were here.

663
00:52:29,506 --> 00:52:32,710
- Are you lying in your bed?
- <i>Mm-hm.</i>

664
00:52:32,744 --> 00:52:34,112
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

665
00:52:35,646 --> 00:52:37,648
- Are they closed?
- <i>Mm-hm.</i>

666
00:52:37,681 --> 00:52:38,850
Are you sure?

667
00:52:57,668 --> 00:53:00,671
Fuck, I wish I was there
watching you right now.

668
00:53:00,704 --> 00:53:04,175
You like that, don't you?
Watching me?

669
00:53:05,676 --> 00:53:07,178
Fuck, yeah, I do.

670
00:53:12,751 --> 00:53:13,818
<i>How'd you sleep?</i>

671
00:53:15,153 --> 00:53:16,187
<i>Good.</i>

672
00:53:17,488 --> 00:53:19,791
Not as good as I do with you.

673
00:53:19,824 --> 00:53:21,692
I know the feeling.

674
00:53:23,962 --> 00:53:27,665
Come here. I miss you.

675
00:53:27,698 --> 00:53:29,868
I miss you too.

676
00:53:29,901 --> 00:53:32,703
Don't say "too." It sounds like
you're just agreeing with me.

677
00:53:38,109 --> 00:53:40,211
I love you.

678
00:53:40,245 --> 00:53:41,846
I love you.

679
00:54:08,539 --> 00:54:11,109
Tessa? Tessa?

680
00:54:12,643 --> 00:54:16,181
Tess! No, no, no, Tessa! Tessa!

681
00:54:18,249 --> 00:54:21,820
Tessa! Tessa!

682
00:54:21,853 --> 00:54:23,054
Tess!

683
00:54:23,088 --> 00:54:24,856
No, no, no!

684
00:54:29,294 --> 00:54:31,196
- I love you.
- I love you too.

685
00:54:33,865 --> 00:54:36,034
Fuck you! No, no!

686
00:55:10,101 --> 00:55:12,070
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

687
00:55:14,705 --> 00:55:17,075
What... What are you doing here?

688
00:55:17,108 --> 00:55:20,178
Well, I came to see you.
But I can leave.

689
00:55:23,048 --> 00:55:24,149
No.

690
00:55:26,351 --> 00:55:28,086
- I'm gonna get my bags.
- Mm-mm.

691
00:55:33,892 --> 00:55:35,794
Give us a hand.

692
00:55:37,796 --> 00:55:39,964
What's the fastest
train you've been on?

693
00:55:39,998 --> 00:55:41,866
- There's this train in Japan.
- Oh, hey!

694
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,168
- Hey, hey.
- Hardin.

695
00:55:43,201 --> 00:55:44,335
Smith, what's up?

696
00:55:44,369 --> 00:55:45,937
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

697
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:47,272
He asked if he could stay,

698
00:55:47,305 --> 00:55:49,874
and I thought you might
be all right with that.

699
00:55:49,908 --> 00:55:52,243
It's a lovely place.
Where should I drop my stuff?

700
00:55:52,277 --> 00:55:53,978
- Uh, let me show you.
- Cool.

701
00:55:54,012 --> 00:55:55,880
I'll call you guys
when dinner's ready.

702
00:55:55,914 --> 00:55:58,249
- Sounds good.
- It's this way.

703
00:55:58,283 --> 00:56:00,717
It's nice to see
a smile back on her face.

704
00:56:00,752 --> 00:56:01,685
It is.

705
00:56:08,226 --> 00:56:10,995
So, um, I found this.

706
00:56:12,197 --> 00:56:13,697
And I'm really sorry,

707
00:56:13,731 --> 00:56:16,034
but once I picked it up,
I couldn't put it down.

708
00:56:24,075 --> 00:56:27,145
You're a brilliant writer, Tess.

709
00:56:27,178 --> 00:56:29,347
And I came across
that page about pain

710
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:31,916
and I just wanted to apologize.

711
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:33,952
The way I made you feel
is inexcusable.

712
00:56:33,985 --> 00:56:36,254
So I'm sorry.

713
00:56:36,287 --> 00:56:39,224
I didn't mean for you
to read any of this...

714
00:56:39,257 --> 00:56:41,126
- I'm sure you didn't.
- It's pretty raw.

715
00:56:42,327 --> 00:56:43,828
I needed to hear it.

716
00:56:45,163 --> 00:56:46,764
In your words.

717
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:49,801
And I fucking hate myself

718
00:56:49,834 --> 00:56:52,237
for making you feel that way,
but I'm sorry.

719
00:56:56,808 --> 00:56:58,910
Thank you.

720
00:56:58,943 --> 00:57:00,411
Hey! Steaks are on!

721
00:57:03,481 --> 00:57:05,016
Be right there!

722
00:57:11,722 --> 00:57:13,458
Oh.

723
00:57:13,491 --> 00:57:14,893
Will we?

724
00:57:21,399 --> 00:57:23,401
<i>I love you too.</i>

725
00:57:26,037 --> 00:57:28,306
We shouldn't keep them waiting.

726
00:57:28,339 --> 00:57:30,942
What? I mean,
I'm sure that they're fine.

727
00:57:30,975 --> 00:57:32,143
Come on, I'm hungry.

728
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:41,419
He really wants me to go.
He keeps talking

729
00:57:41,452 --> 00:57:43,988
about me wearing the hat
and the gown and everything.

730
00:57:44,022 --> 00:57:46,991
- What's so bad about that?
- It just looks ridiculous.

731
00:57:47,025 --> 00:57:49,227
Can you imagine me in the hat
and the gown and everything?

732
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,862
I don't even wanna go
to the ceremony.

733
00:57:50,895 --> 00:57:52,931
I can't imagine it,
but I really wanna see it.

734
00:57:54,265 --> 00:57:56,501
You gotta celebrate
your accomplishments.

735
00:57:56,534 --> 00:57:58,369
You don't wanna
look back and regret

736
00:57:58,403 --> 00:58:00,838
having not had
those experiences.

737
00:58:00,872 --> 00:58:03,274
Trust me, I know firsthand.

738
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:07,445
- I'll give it some thought.
- I think you should.

739
00:58:09,047 --> 00:58:10,448
- Hey, buddy.
- Hi.

740
00:58:10,481 --> 00:58:12,317
This needs turning,
do you wanna do it?

741
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:14,786
- Why not?
- Okay. There you go. Grab that.

742
00:58:14,819 --> 00:58:18,289
- This is really nice.
- Yeah.

743
00:58:18,323 --> 00:58:23,027
You know, all of us
together, under one roof.

744
00:58:24,128 --> 00:58:26,331
- Here we all are.
- Yeah.

745
00:58:28,132 --> 00:58:32,136
- Well, tonight, anyway.
- Oh, come on.

746
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:34,472
You two will work it out.

747
00:58:34,505 --> 00:58:36,407
Sometimes distance is
a good thing.

748
00:58:36,441 --> 00:58:37,742
Mmm.

749
00:58:38,876 --> 00:58:39,844
You think so?

750
00:58:41,479 --> 00:58:43,147
Honestly, I have no idea.

751
00:58:46,284 --> 00:58:49,454
Look, relationships...

752
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:53,324
they're complicated.

753
01:00:06,064 --> 01:00:07,098
Hey.

754
01:00:25,016 --> 01:00:26,217
Did I do something?

755
01:00:30,021 --> 01:00:33,224
You've barely said a word to me
the whole night.

756
01:00:47,038 --> 01:00:49,440
I had this horrible dream
of you and Robert.

757
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:55,413
I can't get it
out of my fucking head.

758
01:01:01,419 --> 01:01:04,021
But I'm here with you.

759
01:01:07,725 --> 01:01:09,460
That's exactly it.

760
01:01:14,999 --> 01:01:18,169
I can't help but think that
you should be with someone else.

761
01:01:21,372 --> 01:01:23,474
Your life would be
so much easier.

762
01:01:29,347 --> 01:01:30,681
There's all this bad shit

763
01:01:30,715 --> 01:01:33,084
that I've been trying
to suppress for so long.

764
01:01:33,117 --> 01:01:34,519
It's just all coming up.

765
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,555
And there's nothing I can do.

766
01:01:39,424 --> 01:01:42,059
The thought of losing you
is just, heh...

767
01:01:42,093 --> 01:01:44,162
It's pretty fucking dark
in here, Tess.

768
01:01:50,301 --> 01:01:52,069
Why didn't you just tell me?

769
01:01:52,103 --> 01:01:54,238
That's the whole point
of being open...

770
01:01:54,272 --> 01:01:57,608
Because it's a burden for me,
and I don't wanna burden you.

771
01:02:09,454 --> 01:02:12,457
I don't want to be
with anyone else.

772
01:02:14,592 --> 01:02:16,294
I wanna be with you.

773
01:02:20,498 --> 01:02:21,599
Hey.

774
01:02:47,058 --> 01:02:49,494
Fuck me until
you forget about that dream.

775
01:03:50,454 --> 01:03:52,223
Oh, fuck.

776
01:03:54,292 --> 01:03:58,129
Look in the mirror.

777
01:04:00,498 --> 01:04:02,734
Oh, yes, baby.

778
01:04:02,768 --> 01:04:05,469
- You close?
- Yeah.

779
01:04:45,744 --> 01:04:47,712
We didn't
use protection last night.

780
01:04:50,648 --> 01:04:52,149
Yeah, I know.

781
01:04:53,785 --> 01:04:56,587
I'll have to go
to the drugstore tonight.

782
01:04:56,621 --> 01:04:58,723
I should get on the pill anyway.

783
01:05:03,394 --> 01:05:04,362
Yeah.

784
01:05:05,764 --> 01:05:08,332
Yeah, you with no condom,
on a regular basis,

785
01:05:08,366 --> 01:05:09,868
that's gonna work for me.

786
01:05:21,679 --> 01:05:23,147
Here are the kids.

787
01:05:27,218 --> 01:05:28,519
Hey, hey.

788
01:05:28,552 --> 01:05:31,222
You look in better spirits
this morning.

789
01:05:32,723 --> 01:05:35,794
Yeah, think I just needed
a good night's sleep.

790
01:05:39,865 --> 01:05:41,733
Oh, it's Mom. One sec, guys.

791
01:05:41,767 --> 01:05:43,735
- Hi, Mom.
- <i>Hi, my love.</i>

792
01:05:43,769 --> 01:05:44,903
<i>How are you doing?</i>

793
01:05:44,936 --> 01:05:46,938
Good, thanks. How are you?

794
01:05:46,972 --> 01:05:49,975
That must be about the wedding.

795
01:05:50,008 --> 01:05:51,375
Uh, whose wedding?

796
01:05:53,477 --> 01:05:56,647
- Trish is...? Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

797
01:05:56,681 --> 01:05:58,750
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's amazing.

798
01:05:58,784 --> 01:06:00,651
She deserves it.

799
01:06:00,685 --> 01:06:05,556
Yeah. And Mike is a good guy.
So he'll look after her.

800
01:06:05,589 --> 01:06:07,658
- Okay, let's go.
- Oh!

801
01:06:07,692 --> 01:06:09,727
- Okay.
- Come on, bud.

802
01:06:11,362 --> 01:06:12,563
- Smith.
- What?

803
01:06:12,596 --> 01:06:13,765
Hey, hey, hey! Backpack.

804
01:06:15,366 --> 01:06:16,567
Hey.

805
01:06:17,869 --> 01:06:21,006
- Bye.
- Bye.

806
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:23,674
I will, I will, I will.
All right.

807
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:24,843
Bye.

808
01:06:30,614 --> 01:06:33,885
What? What?

809
01:06:33,919 --> 01:06:34,953
So?

810
01:06:36,721 --> 01:06:40,725
So, what do you wanna do today?

811
01:08:11,116 --> 01:08:14,485
- Got everything?
- Yep.

812
01:08:26,497 --> 01:08:27,698
There's nothing...

813
01:08:27,732 --> 01:08:29,600
There's nothing
you've forgotten?

814
01:08:32,037 --> 01:08:34,705
No, I think I'm good.

815
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:41,913
What happened to our not keeping
secrets from each other?

816
01:08:41,947 --> 01:08:44,648
- What are you on about?
- You're not gonna tell me

817
01:08:44,682 --> 01:08:46,117
about your mom's wedding?

818
01:08:47,618 --> 01:08:48,552
Tess...

819
01:08:50,454 --> 01:08:51,957
the only reason
I haven't told you

820
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:54,558
- is because I don't want to go.
- Okay. Why...

821
01:08:54,592 --> 01:08:56,061
Why don't you wanna go?

822
01:08:56,094 --> 01:08:58,395
I thought you wanted
to show me your hometown.

823
01:08:58,429 --> 01:09:03,168
I wanna show you London. I do
not wanna show you my hometown.

824
01:09:03,201 --> 01:09:05,569
If you don't wanna bring me,
I think that that's fine.

825
01:09:05,603 --> 01:09:07,705
But it's her big day.

826
01:09:07,739 --> 01:09:10,008
I really think
you need to be there for her.

827
01:09:10,041 --> 01:09:13,677
If I was going,
I would bring you, but...

828
01:09:13,711 --> 01:09:15,747
Do you know what,
I'll think about it.

829
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:18,149
- Okay?
- Okay.

830
01:09:18,183 --> 01:09:20,584
Hey, this was a good weekend.

831
01:09:20,618 --> 01:09:22,921
- How good?
- This good.

832
01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:27,158
Better.

833
01:09:27,192 --> 01:09:30,996
Can you come back on Wednesday?
Vance is having an event.

834
01:09:32,931 --> 01:09:34,498
I'll try.

835
01:09:40,772 --> 01:09:41,973
Okay.

836
01:10:47,072 --> 01:10:48,773
Richard?

837
01:10:48,807 --> 01:10:50,641
I nearly smashed
your fucking head in!

838
01:10:52,210 --> 01:10:54,511
What the fuck are you thinking,
breaking in here?

839
01:10:54,545 --> 01:10:57,048
You weren't here, and, uh...

840
01:10:57,082 --> 01:10:59,516
Tess told me
where you keep the key.

841
01:10:59,550 --> 01:11:02,120
You look like shit.

842
01:11:02,153 --> 01:11:05,723
Yeah, well, uh, I owe a guy.

843
01:11:05,757 --> 01:11:08,259
- How much are you in for?
- Five hundred.

844
01:11:29,848 --> 01:11:30,815
You can take this.

845
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:36,054
Here.

846
01:11:38,589 --> 01:11:40,657
My dad gave me that.

847
01:11:40,691 --> 01:11:41,725
I never wear it.

848
01:11:43,261 --> 01:11:45,696
It's worth a lot more
than what you need, so...

849
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:46,697
Thanks.

850
01:11:47,999 --> 01:11:49,834
Yeah.

851
01:11:51,369 --> 01:11:53,271
I'm gonna get better for her.

852
01:11:56,141 --> 01:11:57,175
I'm gonna get better.

853
01:11:58,276 --> 01:11:59,811
I promise.

854
01:12:12,791 --> 01:12:14,859
This should protect you
from pregnancy

855
01:12:14,893 --> 01:12:16,928
for the next three months.

856
01:12:16,961 --> 01:12:19,197
My concern is...

857
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:21,199
you may not need it.

858
01:12:21,232 --> 01:12:24,302
<i>It's your cervix.</i>

859
01:12:24,335 --> 01:12:26,738
<i>You may not be able
to get pregnant.</i>

860
01:12:26,771 --> 01:12:29,074
<i>We need to do more tests
before we know.</i>

861
01:12:50,128 --> 01:12:52,163
Hmm.

862
01:12:52,197 --> 01:12:53,798
As much as I'd like to help,

863
01:12:53,832 --> 01:12:55,733
by the time you apply
for the transfer,

864
01:12:55,767 --> 01:12:58,036
you register and start classes,

865
01:12:58,069 --> 01:12:59,904
I don't think
it's worth the hassle.

866
01:12:59,938 --> 01:13:01,672
And I don't think
you're gonna get

867
01:13:01,705 --> 01:13:03,174
the classes you need
to graduate.

868
01:13:03,208 --> 01:13:04,909
I figured
you were gonna say this.

869
01:13:04,943 --> 01:13:07,812
- Just thought I'd give it a try.
- It's only two months.

870
01:13:07,846 --> 01:13:10,248
And you know, it's been
one of my biggest dreams

871
01:13:10,281 --> 01:13:13,084
to see you graduate.

872
01:13:13,118 --> 01:13:15,286
I guess it hasn't always
been a given, has it?

873
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,789
No, no. It hasn't.

874
01:13:17,822 --> 01:13:21,025
It has been a gift,
having you here.

875
01:13:21,059 --> 01:13:25,163
And I'm grateful that you were
willing to give me a chance

876
01:13:25,196 --> 01:13:26,663
to see me sober.

877
01:13:27,765 --> 01:13:28,933
Yeah.

878
01:13:31,169 --> 01:13:32,170
When was that?

879
01:13:33,438 --> 01:13:36,074
Oh, that was freshman year.

880
01:13:36,107 --> 01:13:37,842
Your mom, Vance and I.

881
01:13:39,310 --> 01:13:40,845
Never seen it before.

882
01:13:42,413 --> 01:13:44,681
You know she's getting married.

883
01:13:44,715 --> 01:13:46,151
- To Mike?
- To Mike.

884
01:13:46,184 --> 01:13:49,120
Oh, good for her. He always
seemed like a nice guy.

885
01:13:49,154 --> 01:13:52,423
I've always thought he was a bit
of a wanker, but if she's happy.

886
01:13:53,724 --> 01:13:54,993
Two months!

887
01:13:55,026 --> 01:13:56,261
It's just gonna go like...

888
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:30,962
- Hey!
- Hello.

889
01:14:30,995 --> 01:14:32,430
Don't you two look gorgeous.

890
01:14:32,463 --> 01:14:33,865
Obviously.

891
01:14:36,434 --> 01:14:38,970
Relax, it's soda water.

892
01:14:39,003 --> 01:14:41,873
- Did you tell him? Did...?
- Vance called me.

893
01:14:41,906 --> 01:14:45,243
- Oh.
- Well, enjoy.

894
01:14:46,477 --> 01:14:48,846
- I have to go play hostess.
- Okay.

895
01:14:53,251 --> 01:14:56,087
They were ecstatic when
I told them you were coming.

896
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:57,288
What, just them?

897
01:14:58,823 --> 01:15:02,160
Well, I was... I was happy.

898
01:15:03,294 --> 01:15:05,129
Um...

899
01:15:05,163 --> 01:15:07,298
I do have some bad news.

900
01:15:07,332 --> 01:15:08,733
Oh. Uh, what?

901
01:15:10,401 --> 01:15:12,971
It's not looking like
I'm gonna be able to get here

902
01:15:13,004 --> 01:15:15,773
- for another two months.
- What, uh...?

903
01:15:15,807 --> 01:15:17,442
What do you mean, like visit?

904
01:15:17,475 --> 01:15:19,310
Wait, what?

905
01:15:19,344 --> 01:15:21,846
What? What do you mean?

906
01:15:21,879 --> 01:15:23,781
I mean, like, for good.

907
01:15:26,251 --> 01:15:29,821
Like... Uh, wait.

908
01:15:29,854 --> 01:15:32,924
- Do you mean like move here?
- It's two months, though.

909
01:15:32,957 --> 01:15:34,926
- I wonder if I should even...
- Are you serious?

910
01:15:34,959 --> 01:15:37,895
Should I call the whole thing
off? Maybe I should cancel it.

911
01:15:37,929 --> 01:15:40,465
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

912
01:15:42,567 --> 01:15:47,038
Hate to break it up,
but I wanna dance!

913
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:48,906
Come on!

914
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:50,842
How are you, my boy?

915
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:57,515
- There's my boy.
- Hey.

916
01:15:57,548 --> 01:16:00,585
- How are you?
- Never better.

917
01:16:08,526 --> 01:16:11,829
- I gotta go to work.
- Go ahead.

918
01:17:24,369 --> 01:17:27,638
- Let's go. Right now. Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

919
01:17:37,648 --> 01:17:39,417
You're moving here.

920
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:44,689
Yeah.

921
01:18:10,548 --> 01:18:12,417
Right.

922
01:18:12,450 --> 01:18:15,319
- Your elbows are up again.
- Oh, man.

923
01:18:15,353 --> 01:18:16,554
All right, then.

924
01:18:18,289 --> 01:18:19,957
You looking forward
to visiting home?

925
01:18:19,991 --> 01:18:21,259
I know I am.

926
01:18:22,761 --> 01:18:24,462
Oh, I see.

927
01:18:24,495 --> 01:18:27,365
Celebrating your mom's happiness
doesn't sound appealing?

928
01:18:27,398 --> 01:18:29,567
It's not that.

929
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,169
So, what's going on?

930
01:18:34,639 --> 01:18:36,240
I really want to bring Tessa,

931
01:18:36,274 --> 01:18:38,576
but I don't want to bring her
around my old life.

932
01:18:38,609 --> 01:18:40,445
It's just a sad house
in a sad place.

933
01:18:45,016 --> 01:18:48,386
Has she ever made you feel badly
about your past?

934
01:18:48,419 --> 01:18:51,389
- No.
- The only way you can find out

935
01:18:51,422 --> 01:18:55,092
if you trust her
is to trust her.

936
01:18:55,126 --> 01:18:57,662
And it'd mean the world to
Trish, having you both there.

937
01:19:04,368 --> 01:19:06,103
Look. Seriously, mate.

938
01:19:08,206 --> 01:19:11,542
Your wedding is
a moment that's...

939
01:19:13,377 --> 01:19:16,647
bigger than anything else
that you can possibly imagine.

940
01:19:16,681 --> 01:19:19,450
- Kind of changes you.
- Mm-hm.

941
01:19:19,484 --> 01:19:21,352
And that's why
they all fail, right?

942
01:19:21,385 --> 01:19:22,754
Not all of them.

943
01:19:22,788 --> 01:19:24,655
Not if you find the right one.

944
01:19:26,825 --> 01:19:30,161
You know, I believe

945
01:19:30,194 --> 01:19:33,698
that you have
two real great loves.

946
01:19:33,732 --> 01:19:37,401
So in your case,
that would be Tessa and you.

947
01:19:41,272 --> 01:19:43,508
You gonna show me what you got?

948
01:19:43,541 --> 01:19:45,376
- Yeah. Come on, then.
- Aah!

949
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,529
I got us tickets to England.

950
01:20:07,766 --> 01:20:09,166
Mmm...

951
01:20:26,852 --> 01:20:29,453
- Keep the change.
- Don't worry, Mom. I'll get it.

952
01:20:29,487 --> 01:20:31,689
- No, no, no. I've got it.
- Hi.

953
01:20:31,722 --> 01:20:33,724
Oh, it's so good
to see you both.

954
01:20:33,759 --> 01:20:36,294
Jesus, Tessa.
Is there a body in there?

955
01:20:36,327 --> 01:20:38,429
I didn't know
how much I'd need.

956
01:20:38,462 --> 01:20:39,798
Here you go.

957
01:20:39,831 --> 01:20:41,165
Thank you.

958
01:20:41,198 --> 01:20:42,700
How was the flight?

959
01:20:42,734 --> 01:20:44,468
Sorry it's not more comfortable.

960
01:20:44,502 --> 01:20:47,271
I didn't expect the house
to sell on the first day.

961
01:20:47,305 --> 01:20:49,140
No, it's great.

962
01:20:49,173 --> 01:20:50,809
I left your bed up, Hardin.

963
01:20:52,476 --> 01:20:54,612
I wasn't expecting
to sleep on the floor.

964
01:20:55,847 --> 01:20:58,349
It's perfect. Thank you.

965
01:20:58,382 --> 01:20:59,851
Well, you guys
must be exhausted.

966
01:20:59,885 --> 01:21:01,452
So I'll leave you to it.

967
01:21:01,485 --> 01:21:04,155
I'm staying next door at Mike's.

968
01:21:04,188 --> 01:21:05,289
Okay.

969
01:21:07,793 --> 01:21:09,627
Hey, give me a sec...

970
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:12,630
- We're really happy for you.
- Thank you.

971
01:21:12,663 --> 01:21:14,800
I'm glad you came.

972
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:17,234
I've gotta go to
the bridal store in the morning.

973
01:21:17,268 --> 01:21:18,804
I was wondering,
do you wanna come?

974
01:21:18,837 --> 01:21:22,506
- Yeah, I'd love to. That's...
- Great. Great.

975
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:24,308
- Call me if you need me.
- Okay.

976
01:21:24,342 --> 01:21:25,476
- Bye.
- Bye.

977
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:31,449
Don't take any of my stuff
or go in my room,

978
01:21:31,482 --> 01:21:33,417
and definitely don't have
any friends over, okay?

979
01:21:33,451 --> 01:21:36,253
<i>Yeah, yeah.
Hey, thanks for letting me stay here.</i>

980
01:21:36,287 --> 01:21:38,489
Yeah, well, don't thank me,
because it's not permanent.

981
01:21:38,522 --> 01:21:39,825
<i>Yeah, yeah. I know.</i>

982
01:21:39,858 --> 01:21:41,793
Make sure you call
if there's a problem.

983
01:21:41,827 --> 01:21:43,862
<i>Sure thing, Hardin. Bye.</i>

984
01:21:48,532 --> 01:21:50,601
Who was that?

985
01:21:50,635 --> 01:21:52,470
That was a random homeless man

986
01:21:52,503 --> 01:21:54,438
who I've been letting sleep
on my couch.

987
01:21:54,472 --> 01:21:56,775
All the hipsters
are doing it these days.

988
01:22:01,278 --> 01:22:03,681
- Thank you.
- Of course.

989
01:22:17,996 --> 01:22:20,431
- There's nothing to eat.
- What are you looking for?

990
01:22:20,464 --> 01:22:22,266
I don't know. Something edible.

991
01:22:22,299 --> 01:22:24,736
That I don't have to cook,
preferably.

992
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:27,605
Look, why don't you take
the keys and go to Sainsbury's.

993
01:22:27,638 --> 01:22:30,207
It'll give you something to do
when we're gone.

994
01:22:31,409 --> 01:22:32,410
Hi.

995
01:22:32,443 --> 01:22:33,779
- You ready?
- Yep.

996
01:22:37,949 --> 01:22:39,717
Are you sure
you're not jet-lagged?

997
01:22:39,751 --> 01:22:41,519
- I feel fine.
- You don't have to go, you know.

998
01:22:41,552 --> 01:22:42,486
Hardin.

999
01:22:45,423 --> 01:22:47,793
Come on, Tessa. Let's do this.

1000
01:23:23,494 --> 01:23:25,563
I really shouldn't. I'm sorry,
guys. Have one for me.

1001
01:23:25,596 --> 01:23:26,965
Hey, man. Come on. Man.

1002
01:23:36,742 --> 01:23:39,243
Yep. That's it.

1003
01:23:45,382 --> 01:23:47,485
You really look amazing.

1004
01:23:49,487 --> 01:23:51,589
It's beginning to feel real.

1005
01:23:55,526 --> 01:23:56,962
What's her dress like?

1006
01:23:58,395 --> 01:24:01,465
Mmm...
I can't tell you.

1007
01:24:02,934 --> 01:24:04,668
You're seriously
not gonna tell me?

1008
01:24:04,702 --> 01:24:05,971
Yeah, I can't tell you.

1009
01:24:06,004 --> 01:24:08,039
You're gonna
have to wait and see.

1010
01:24:10,608 --> 01:24:12,476
Don't care that much anyway.

1011
01:24:17,115 --> 01:24:19,483
Please tell me.

1012
01:24:19,517 --> 01:24:21,418
No, I won't tell you.

1013
01:24:27,424 --> 01:24:28,860
I'm so glad you came.

1014
01:24:30,996 --> 01:24:33,765
You're my better place, Tess.

1015
01:25:24,715 --> 01:25:26,885
- What the fuck?!
- Oh, fu...!

1016
01:25:26,918 --> 01:25:30,755
Vance! Fucking hell!

1017
01:25:30,789 --> 01:25:34,491
- It's not what you think.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

1018
01:25:34,525 --> 01:25:36,928
Well, it clearly fucking is!

1019
01:25:36,962 --> 01:25:38,629
You're getting married tomorrow.

1020
01:25:38,662 --> 01:25:41,498
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1021
01:25:41,532 --> 01:25:43,001
The love of your life,
Kimberly,

1022
01:25:43,034 --> 01:25:45,070
is carrying your child
while you're here...

1023
01:25:45,103 --> 01:25:46,905
- That's enough!
- What is wrong with you?

1024
01:25:46,938 --> 01:25:48,639
Hardin?

1025
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:50,075
- Vance?
- Yeah.

1026
01:25:50,108 --> 01:25:51,709
He's been fucking my mom!

1027
01:25:51,743 --> 01:25:53,544
Please, Hardin, just stop it!

1028
01:25:53,577 --> 01:25:55,747
Don't yell at me. You don't
get to tell me what to do.

1029
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:58,116
You were getting fucked
on the counter like a slag.

1030
01:25:58,149 --> 01:25:59,751
Don't you talk to your mom
like that.

1031
01:25:59,784 --> 01:26:01,418
- Oh, fuck off!
- Hey.

1032
01:26:01,452 --> 01:26:03,654
Who the fuck are you
to tell me what to do, huh?

1033
01:26:03,687 --> 01:26:05,489
- You really want to know?
- No, Christian, don't.

1034
01:26:05,522 --> 01:26:07,591
- Enough, Hardin!
- Stop, stop.

1035
01:26:07,625 --> 01:26:10,561
- Hardin, please stop it!
- Stop it! Ugh!

1036
01:26:10,594 --> 01:26:12,563
Please, Hardin.

1037
01:26:12,596 --> 01:26:14,900
Hardin, that's enough!

1038
01:26:14,933 --> 01:26:16,134
That's enough!

1039
01:26:17,601 --> 01:26:21,106
Enough. That's enough.

1040
01:26:21,139 --> 01:26:23,942
You're getting married tomorrow.
Did you forget?

1041
01:26:25,676 --> 01:26:28,747
Who the fuck does that?
What are you going to tell Mike?

1042
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:31,917
Hardin, Christian and I...

1043
01:26:31,950 --> 01:26:33,417
- He's...
- What?

1044
01:26:38,056 --> 01:26:39,991
It's not that simple.

1045
01:26:48,599 --> 01:26:50,168
Okay, let's go.

1046
01:26:50,201 --> 01:26:51,736
- Tessa, don't.
- Let's go.

1047
01:26:57,275 --> 01:26:59,543
Are you all right?

1048
01:27:27,806 --> 01:27:29,240
Can you...?

1049
01:27:45,290 --> 01:27:48,559
It's okay. It's okay.

1050
01:27:48,592 --> 01:27:51,129
It is not okay.

1051
01:27:51,162 --> 01:27:53,164
It's not okay.

1052
01:28:07,245 --> 01:28:11,783
- Please, don't ever let me go.
- I won't. I'll never let you go.

1053
01:28:21,725 --> 01:28:25,864
That even though
you're a superhero in my eyes,

1054
01:28:25,897 --> 01:28:27,899
you are still human.

1055
01:28:29,633 --> 01:28:33,238
Mike Richards,
do you take Trish Daniels

1056
01:28:33,271 --> 01:28:35,639
for better or worse?

1057
01:28:38,309 --> 01:28:39,543
I do.

1058
01:28:43,114 --> 01:28:44,749
I really do.

1059
01:28:49,054 --> 01:28:52,791
I'm happy to pronounce
you husband and wife.

1060
01:29:22,686 --> 01:29:24,355
- Hardin...
- I have nothing to say to you.

1061
01:29:24,389 --> 01:29:26,391
- Come on.
- Get the fuck off me!

1062
01:29:26,424 --> 01:29:28,827
Do you wanna go again, old man?

1063
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:31,062
If that's what it takes, yeah.

1064
01:29:33,164 --> 01:29:37,368
- There's a bar in the hotel.
- A fucking bar?

1065
01:29:37,402 --> 01:29:38,837
It's just down the street.

1066
01:29:40,704 --> 01:29:42,340
I'll wait there for you.

1067
01:29:57,088 --> 01:29:59,090
I can come if you want me to.

1068
01:30:01,993 --> 01:30:04,896
But either way,
I think you should go.

1069
01:30:07,298 --> 01:30:09,700
She looks like
she doesn't need telling.

1070
01:30:09,734 --> 01:30:11,769
Yeah. She definitely knows.

1071
01:30:13,972 --> 01:30:16,707
I'm gonna go sit with her,
but if anything goes wrong,

1072
01:30:16,741 --> 01:30:18,276
just come find me.

1073
01:30:33,758 --> 01:30:36,995
I'm surprised to see you here.

1074
01:30:37,028 --> 01:30:38,229
Yeah.

1075
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:47,138
I'm afraid I won't be able
to stay as angry as I am.

1076
01:30:49,007 --> 01:30:50,842
Trust me, I am.

1077
01:30:56,981 --> 01:31:00,885
But what do I do? I love him.

1078
01:31:00,919 --> 01:31:04,923
And I love the life we're
building, and I love Smith.

1079
01:31:19,003 --> 01:31:21,005
You wanted to talk, let's talk.

1080
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:31,349
I know you feel betrayed.

1081
01:31:31,382 --> 01:31:33,785
I want to explain myself.

1082
01:31:33,818 --> 01:31:36,120
But I honestly don't know
where to begin.

1083
01:31:40,091 --> 01:31:42,961
- I guess that makes us done then.
- Look, listen.

1084
01:31:45,496 --> 01:31:47,498
You are so important
to me and your mom.

1085
01:31:47,532 --> 01:31:49,534
Are you serious?

1086
01:31:49,567 --> 01:31:52,203
Now you two want to play
some sort of united front?

1087
01:31:52,237 --> 01:31:54,472
- Fuck off with that.
- You wouldn't be so angry

1088
01:31:54,505 --> 01:31:56,140
if you didn't care.

1089
01:31:58,076 --> 01:32:01,879
You know, I wish I could say
I'm surprised...

1090
01:32:04,015 --> 01:32:05,350
but I'm not.

1091
01:32:07,252 --> 01:32:09,120
They have a history together.

1092
01:32:11,422 --> 01:32:14,192
One that I'm not sure
I can compete with.

1093
01:32:17,395 --> 01:32:21,032
I was gonna tell you ages ago,
but your mom didn't want...

1094
01:32:23,568 --> 01:32:25,169
Tell me what?

1095
01:32:28,039 --> 01:32:29,274
Tell me what?

1096
01:32:41,452 --> 01:32:44,122
Hardin is Christian's son.

1097
01:32:56,501 --> 01:32:58,102
Fuck!

1098
01:32:58,136 --> 01:33:02,206
- You... What the fuck!
- I'm so sorry.

1099
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:03,841
No!

1100
01:33:18,389 --> 01:33:19,891
I'm sorry.

1101
01:33:21,492 --> 01:33:23,094
I have to go.

1102
01:34:51,976 --> 01:34:56,976
