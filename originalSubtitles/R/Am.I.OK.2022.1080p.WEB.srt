{\an8}You're gonna get a veggie burger

16
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:37,005
{\an8}with sweet potato fries.

17
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:38,772
{\an8}You don't know
what I'm gonna get.

18
00:01:38,773 --> 00:01:39,807
{\an8}Okay.

19
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,143
{\an8}You girls all set?

20
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:42,644
{\an8}Yeah. Can I get the
Chinese chicken salad

21
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:44,546
{\an8}- and a hot green tea, please?
- Mmm-hmm.

22
00:01:44,547 --> 00:01:45,414
{\an8}And for you?

23
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:48,016
{\an8}Um, can I please have...

24
00:01:48,017 --> 00:01:49,551
{\an8}the veggie burger?

25
00:01:49,552 --> 00:01:51,386
{\an8}I think... I can't hear you.

26
00:01:51,387 --> 00:01:53,088
{\an8}Veggie burger with sweet
potato fries, please.

27
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:54,622
{\an8}Okay.

28
00:01:54,623 --> 00:01:56,358
{\an8}- Oh, and can I also have an...
- ...iced coffee?

29
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:58,827
{\an8}- Just black. Thank you.
- Black. Thank you.

30
00:02:00,695 --> 00:02:01,696
{\an8}You don't know me.

31
00:02:01,697 --> 00:02:03,232
{\an8}I do know you.

32
00:02:04,232 --> 00:02:05,467
{\an8}What are you doing tonight?

33
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:08,103
{\an8}Um, I'm going to
have dinner with Ben.

34
00:02:08,104 --> 00:02:10,505
{\an8}- Lucy!
- Jane!

35
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,040
{\an8}You have to put him
out of his misery

36
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,136
{\an8}and eff him already.

37
00:02:13,137 --> 00:02:14,709
{\an8}You need to do that.

38
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,245
{\an8}What? I absolutely do not!

39
00:02:17,246 --> 00:02:20,015
{\an8}What's the problem? He's
great, you like him.

40
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:21,449
You get to tell
your kids you met

41
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,651
when his toilet overflowed
into your kitchen.

42
00:02:23,652 --> 00:02:26,754
- Lucy, he's in love with you.
- Hey. Hey, baby.

43
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:29,791
Hi, babe. We just ordered.
I was starving. Hello.

44
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:32,527
Oh, yeah? Well, thank you for
waiting that extra 30 seconds

45
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:33,795
I told you it would
take me to park.

46
00:02:33,796 --> 00:02:35,998
Lucy's having dinner
with Ben tonight.

47
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,101
What? Is tonight the night?

48
00:02:39,102 --> 00:02:40,768
Are we...

49
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:41,869
ready?

50
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,305
Why did you blow on it?

51
00:02:43,306 --> 00:02:45,140
Because it's dusty, silly pants.

52
00:02:45,141 --> 00:02:46,975
We're friends, you guys.

53
00:02:46,976 --> 00:02:49,945
He's going to help me
install this new shelf.

54
00:02:49,946 --> 00:02:52,175
This poor bastard.

55
00:02:52,176 --> 00:02:53,748
- Let me tell you something.
- What?

56
00:02:53,749 --> 00:02:56,818
Before this lovely woman and
I made love to each other...

57
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,620
Ew, no. Don't
say it like that.

58
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:00,055
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

59
00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:01,990
Before we made love
in each other...

60
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:04,426
we were great friends,

61
00:03:04,427 --> 00:03:06,028
and I would've installed
anything for her.

62
00:03:06,029 --> 00:03:07,329
I would've built her a house.

63
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,497
A very small,
conveniently-sized house.

64
00:03:09,498 --> 00:03:10,966
You wanna know why?

65
00:03:10,967 --> 00:03:12,867
Because I knew that was
going to lead to sex.

66
00:03:12,868 --> 00:03:15,270
I followed her
around like an idiot.

67
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:16,504
I got a pedicure once.

68
00:03:16,505 --> 00:03:17,940
Desperately needed, but he did.

69
00:03:17,941 --> 00:03:20,642
You guys, no. We're
seriously just friends.

70
00:03:20,643 --> 00:03:22,444
We shake hands after
we have dinner.

71
00:03:22,445 --> 00:03:24,346
Ew!

72
00:03:24,347 --> 00:03:25,747
- You guys shake hands?
- Yeah.

73
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,349
- Why would you do...
- For God's sake.

74
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,984
Like... Like, he's
your accountant?

75
00:03:28,985 --> 00:03:31,214
- No, it's funny.
- It's not funny.

76
00:03:31,215 --> 00:03:32,654
No, I didn't laugh. I
didn't laugh one time.

77
00:03:32,655 --> 00:03:34,456
I'm telling you
this because I care.

78
00:03:34,457 --> 00:03:36,258
You need to fuck
or get off the pot.

79
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,460
- I don't think that's how...
- Just do it.

80
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:39,962
- Do it.
- Do it.

81
00:03:39,963 --> 00:03:41,029
- Do it.
- Do it!

82
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,198
- Do it!
- Do it!

83
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,301
- We did it!
- Yay.

84
00:03:46,302 --> 00:03:48,803
How many paintings do
you think it can hold?

85
00:03:49,906 --> 00:03:51,234
It's sturdy.

86
00:03:51,235 --> 00:03:52,740
I don't know if I'd
put anything on it.

87
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:54,642
I've never used a drill before.

88
00:04:01,717 --> 00:04:02,518
Thanks.

89
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:03,953
For all your hard work.

90
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:23,506
What is this?

91
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,807
It's a Stella.

92
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:27,910
It might be expired,
though, I...

93
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:30,012
Uh, I don't really
drink a lot of beer,

94
00:04:30,013 --> 00:04:31,879
but it tastes like
beer. Mmm-hmm.

95
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,715
That's not what I meant.

96
00:04:33,716 --> 00:04:36,118
- What did you mean?
- Oh.

97
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:38,387
Oh!

98
00:04:40,388 --> 00:04:43,358
Sorry.

99
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:45,327
- I'm gonna go.
- No, Ben.

100
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:46,694
Why?

101
00:04:46,695 --> 00:04:49,497
Because you just
catapulted off the bed

102
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,000
when I got close to you.

103
00:04:52,366 --> 00:04:53,835
I was caught off guard.

104
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:55,670
Caught off guard is when
somebody tosses a ball at you

105
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,239
and you flinch, but
you still catch it.

106
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,610
You just slithered away
like Mr. Bean or something.

107
00:05:02,611 --> 00:05:05,447
I thought we were
just staying friends.

108
00:05:05,448 --> 00:05:07,482
But you're playing
all these love songs,

109
00:05:07,483 --> 00:05:09,284
like, really romantic ones.

110
00:05:09,285 --> 00:05:10,585
It's a playlist.

111
00:05:10,586 --> 00:05:13,421
It's called, "All
The Feelz," with a z.

112
00:05:13,422 --> 00:05:15,090
I can see how that
would be misleading.

113
00:05:15,091 --> 00:05:19,362
I just liked it
because of the sadness.

114
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:22,731
I'll see you later, Lucy.

115
00:05:34,243 --> 00:05:36,878
I forget, you do like it
when I say "I told you so,"

116
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:39,447
or you don't like that.

117
00:05:39,448 --> 00:05:40,782
Everything was okay

118
00:05:40,783 --> 00:05:42,517
until you put it out
into the universe.

119
00:05:42,518 --> 00:05:44,419
Why don't you just
sleep with him?

120
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,255
- Because I don't want to.
- Oh, why not?

121
00:05:47,256 --> 00:05:48,456
I just don't.

122
00:05:48,457 --> 00:05:51,193
Hmm. May I venture a guess?

123
00:05:51,194 --> 00:05:52,794
- No.
- I think

124
00:05:52,795 --> 00:05:54,262
it's because you're afraid
of getting close to someone

125
00:05:54,263 --> 00:05:55,530
for fear of rejection.

126
00:05:55,531 --> 00:05:57,532
Or it could be a
fear of intimacy

127
00:05:57,533 --> 00:05:59,834
stemming from your youth,
your parents' bad marriage

128
00:05:59,835 --> 00:06:03,539
or something that happened
you can't even remember.

129
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:05,073
No.

130
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:07,342
Hi. Have you two been
in my class with before?

131
00:06:07,343 --> 00:06:09,277
- We haven't.
- Great.

132
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:11,279
I love virgins.

133
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,081
Wow. Oh, my God.

134
00:06:13,082 --> 00:06:15,450
You two were definitely
sisters in a past life.

135
00:06:15,451 --> 00:06:17,119
But one of you
betrayed the other

136
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,588
and burned her at the
stake for being a witch.

137
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,457
That feels like a
her thing to do.

138
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,192
Anyways, if you need anything

139
00:06:24,193 --> 00:06:26,194
during the class,
just let me know.

140
00:06:26,195 --> 00:06:28,096
I do really bomb adjustments.

141
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:29,932
- "Bomb adjustments."
- Thank you all for letting me

142
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:31,733
be a part of your
practice today.

143
00:06:31,734 --> 00:06:36,138
Yoga is a great way to calm
our minds and our bodies

144
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:39,607
and to become one with
ourselves and each other.

145
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,843
So, today's class is gonna be

146
00:06:41,844 --> 00:06:44,407
a rap battle between
Fetty Wap and Lil Yachty.

147
00:06:52,021 --> 00:06:53,788
Do you really think
we were sisters?

148
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:56,658
I don't think someone
named Sky Jade

149
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:58,293
would make that up.

150
00:06:58,294 --> 00:07:00,728
I hope I was the cool sister.

151
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:02,297
I hope I was called Denise.

152
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:04,500
What?

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,001
Denise?

154
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:07,669
Yeah. I've always
wanted to be Denise.

155
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:11,073
That's so lezz.

156
00:07:11,074 --> 00:07:13,008
What? Was Nonce taken?

157
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:14,509
No, but Nance was.

158
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,544
Nonce was available.

159
00:07:16,545 --> 00:07:18,080
Nobody's named Nonce.

160
00:07:21,682 --> 00:07:23,318
Don't you wanna have
a different name?

161
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:24,586
Yeah!

162
00:07:24,587 --> 00:07:25,787
But I want it to
be something fun,

163
00:07:25,788 --> 00:07:28,390
like Frederica, Taraji.

164
00:07:28,391 --> 00:07:30,993
You're Denise!

165
00:07:30,994 --> 00:07:34,796
I can't wait to only call
you Denise from now on.

166
00:07:34,797 --> 00:07:36,431
Can you please
drop me off at work

167
00:07:36,432 --> 00:07:38,333
so I don't have
to go home first?

168
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:39,668
You got it.

169
00:07:44,438 --> 00:07:46,141
Going to the bathroom.

170
00:07:58,887 --> 00:08:00,722
I stole some tampons.

171
00:08:00,723 --> 00:08:02,485
These are good ones.

172
00:08:02,486 --> 00:08:04,726
Call me later, and take a shower

173
00:08:04,727 --> 00:08:06,328
because that is a
tough smell right now.

174
00:08:07,396 --> 00:08:09,331
Good morning, Luce.

175
00:08:09,332 --> 00:08:10,598
- Hi.
- Hi, my love.

176
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:11,899
You're here early.

177
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,102
Yeah, I was gonna
meditate with a view,

178
00:08:14,103 --> 00:08:15,303
but then I started making

179
00:08:15,304 --> 00:08:17,605
a mood board on
Pinterest so...

180
00:08:17,606 --> 00:08:19,607
Hi. I'm Jane.

181
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:22,277
Hi, I'm Brittany.
Nice to meet you.

182
00:08:22,278 --> 00:08:23,778
Jane is my best friend.

183
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:25,213
Brittany's a new masseuse here.

184
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:26,714
Oh, cool.

185
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,883
I love your best friend.

186
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,652
She's a real doozy, isn't she?

187
00:08:32,021 --> 00:08:34,456
I'll see you later. It
was nice to meet you.

188
00:08:34,457 --> 00:08:35,959
You, too.

189
00:08:38,593 --> 00:08:40,462
Bye, Luce.

190
00:08:40,463 --> 00:08:43,699
Or Denise. Or
whatever your name is.

191
00:08:54,175 --> 00:08:55,710
Oh, my God.

192
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:57,245
Jane, you have a second?

193
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,646
Yeah, of course.

194
00:08:58,647 --> 00:09:01,216
Let me just finish
this work-related text.

195
00:09:01,217 --> 00:09:02,850
I want to talk to
you about something,

196
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:04,853
and I want you to
listen closely.

197
00:09:05,953 --> 00:09:07,689
I've been going
through your emails

198
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,554
and all of your
electronic communication.

199
00:09:11,392 --> 00:09:12,995
Listen...

200
00:09:12,996 --> 00:09:14,629
We just googled those penises.

201
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,931
No one has that condition.

202
00:09:15,932 --> 00:09:17,532
Ah.

203
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:18,967
I'm totally kidding.

204
00:09:18,968 --> 00:09:20,535
I honestly don't care
what you email about.

205
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,238
Jane, you're from London, right?

206
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:25,974
Like, I'm sharp enough
to pick up on this twang.

207
00:09:25,975 --> 00:09:27,842
Yes. I mean, I
haven't lived there

208
00:09:27,843 --> 00:09:30,612
since I was, like,
16. But, yes.

209
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:33,716
Um, how would you feel about
opening up an office there?

210
00:09:34,215 --> 00:09:35,217
Seriously?

211
00:09:35,218 --> 00:09:36,919
Yeah, there's a
chocolate company

212
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,989
that wants to give Cadbury
a real run for its Bunny.

213
00:09:45,592 --> 00:09:46,894
Isn't that clever?

214
00:09:46,895 --> 00:09:49,698
I thought of it as
I was saying it.

215
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,596
They want our help
with the campaign,

216
00:09:53,597 --> 00:09:55,303
and I know you'd
be perfect for it.

217
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:56,599
Honestly, I think you're ready

218
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,373
to have a whole
division to yourself.

219
00:09:58,374 --> 00:10:01,109
That's an amazing offer.

220
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,677
I...

221
00:10:02,678 --> 00:10:03,778
I don't know what to say.

222
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,248
Well, I do. You can say yes.

223
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,611
At least think
about it, all right?

224
00:10:08,612 --> 00:10:10,085
We'll make it worth your while.

225
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:12,387
- Okay. Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

226
00:10:12,388 --> 00:10:14,089
Yeah, sure, sure.
Get out of here.

227
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,158
Yeah.

228
00:10:17,558 --> 00:10:18,995
Actually, you can leave it open.

229
00:10:19,927 --> 00:10:21,663
Actually, shut it.

230
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:22,830
Not all the way.

231
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:23,699
- That's good right there.
- Yep.

232
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,934
Little more.

233
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,300
Perfect.

234
00:10:41,717 --> 00:10:43,085
Did you get my text?

235
00:10:43,086 --> 00:10:45,353
<i>Yes. You are such
a strange person.</i>

236
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:48,423
<i>Can we get drinks later?</i>

237
00:10:48,424 --> 00:10:51,293
Um, yeah. Are you okay?

238
00:10:51,294 --> 00:10:53,828
<i>Yeah, it's just dumb work stuff.</i>

239
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:55,463
Okay, it's not cancer?

240
00:10:55,464 --> 00:10:57,433
<i>What? No. Goodbye.</i>

241
00:10:58,533 --> 00:10:59,634
- Hey.
- Ooh.

242
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:00,802
Whoa.

243
00:11:00,803 --> 00:11:01,665
- Sorry. Let me get that.
- Sorry.

244
00:11:02,738 --> 00:11:04,239
Hmm.

245
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,640
Whoa, that's incredible.

246
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:07,309
Oh, I just like to doodle.

247
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,712
It's better than a doodle.

248
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:12,981
I love that you can do that.

249
00:11:12,982 --> 00:11:14,382
- Meg?
- Yes?

250
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,319
- Are you ready to head back?
- I'm ready.

251
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:33,135
Sorry, I was
googling butt herpes.

252
00:11:33,136 --> 00:11:35,503
- Hello, Lucy.
- I got you a tequils.

253
00:11:35,504 --> 00:11:37,873
Oh, God bless you.

254
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,442
Mmm.

255
00:11:41,142 --> 00:11:42,810
Mmm.

256
00:11:42,811 --> 00:11:44,812
What a delicious beverage.

257
00:11:44,813 --> 00:11:46,281
You may now tell me
what happened today.

258
00:11:46,282 --> 00:11:48,016
Wait, before you
guys get into that,

259
00:11:48,017 --> 00:11:49,251
I'm gonna go take a leak

260
00:11:49,252 --> 00:11:50,652
while you two sync your periods.

261
00:11:50,653 --> 00:11:51,714
Mmm! Nailed it.

262
00:11:51,715 --> 00:11:53,221
- Dumb.
- Stupid.

263
00:11:53,222 --> 00:11:54,890
- Ah.
- Really stupid.

264
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,128
So, um...

265
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:02,830
I got called into
Stu's office today.

266
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:05,533
Did you get fired?

267
00:12:05,534 --> 00:12:07,971
No, I kind of got a promotion.

268
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,139
Jane that is so awesome.

269
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,142
They want to transfer
me to London.

270
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,378
Wait, what?

271
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:19,182
He wants me to
start up an office

272
00:12:19,881 --> 00:12:21,084
in London.

273
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:24,219
What did you say?

274
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,822
I said yes.

275
00:12:28,055 --> 00:12:29,657
Wow, that's great.

276
00:12:29,658 --> 00:12:31,794
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.

277
00:12:32,388 --> 00:12:34,029
Crazy, right?

278
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,999
When... When? When
does this happen?

279
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,333
Well, not for, like, six months.

280
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:41,103
So, it's not like
tomorrow or anything.

281
00:12:41,104 --> 00:12:43,671
Awesome. That's so awesome!

282
00:12:43,672 --> 00:12:45,307
This is so awesome.

283
00:12:45,308 --> 00:12:47,475
Wow. Awesome.

284
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:49,077
You really deserve this.

285
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:52,414
I just feel like,
"Why not?" You know?

286
00:12:52,415 --> 00:12:54,182
Like, I've never
been an adult there.

287
00:12:54,183 --> 00:12:55,951
I might like it. I can
take the tube to work.

288
00:12:55,952 --> 00:12:57,452
I've never taken
the tube to work.

289
00:12:57,453 --> 00:12:58,521
Yeah.

290
00:12:59,286 --> 00:13:00,455
What about Danny?

291
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:01,689
Oh, he's in.

292
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,125
I mean, what else
is he going to do?

293
00:13:03,126 --> 00:13:04,093
He said he could find
some nerdy music blog

294
00:13:04,094 --> 00:13:05,327
to write for over there.

295
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:06,594
I mean, maybe London
will inspire him

296
00:13:06,595 --> 00:13:09,531
to fucking propose.

297
00:13:09,532 --> 00:13:12,834
You think you're gonna get
engaged while you're there?

298
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:15,438
Well, I mean...

299
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,439
No...

300
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,907
He'll probably wait
another eight years.

301
00:13:18,908 --> 00:13:20,243
Mmm-hmm.

302
00:13:20,942 --> 00:13:21,877
What?

303
00:13:21,878 --> 00:13:23,745
I know it kinda sucks.

304
00:13:23,746 --> 00:13:25,448
I'm so happy for you.

305
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,983
But...

306
00:13:27,984 --> 00:13:30,485
Well... it's gonna
be weird, isn't it?

307
00:13:30,486 --> 00:13:32,620
Not living five minutes
away from each other.

308
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:35,390
Yeah, but I mean, it's...

309
00:13:35,391 --> 00:13:38,593
- That's... I'm busy, you know?
- Mmm-hmm.

310
00:13:38,594 --> 00:13:41,296
There's, like, all of the
stuff that's going real well,

311
00:13:41,297 --> 00:13:43,932
and all the other
really important things,

312
00:13:43,933 --> 00:13:45,934
and the kids are almost
in college, so...

313
00:13:45,935 --> 00:13:48,370
Uh, how many kids
do you have again?

314
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:49,938
I have 12 kids.

315
00:13:49,939 --> 00:13:51,941
What are their names again?

316
00:13:52,741 --> 00:13:55,877
They're all named Denise.

317
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:58,480
That's right.

318
00:13:58,481 --> 00:13:59,747
Well, honestly, Lucy,

319
00:13:59,748 --> 00:14:01,816
this might be
really good for you.

320
00:14:01,817 --> 00:14:04,219
Start painting again.
Sell some shit.

321
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,887
I won't be here to distract you.

322
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:08,356
Yeah, totally.
Everything... Jane.

323
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:11,059
Everything is gonna
be fine, okay?

324
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,328
You're gonna be
fine. I'm fine.

325
00:14:15,098 --> 00:14:17,966
You promise you're gonna
come back all the time?

326
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:19,935
Yes, of course.

327
00:14:21,804 --> 00:14:23,472
But do you know when?

328
00:14:24,472 --> 00:14:25,908
Like, what dates?

329
00:14:25,909 --> 00:14:27,543
I don't know exactly, but often.

330
00:14:27,976 --> 00:14:29,511
Cool.

331
00:14:30,914 --> 00:14:32,347
Do you wipe front to back?

332
00:14:32,348 --> 00:14:34,549
Yeah, you have to
wipe front to back.

333
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,051
Yeah, but some people
wipe all the way

334
00:14:36,052 --> 00:14:37,452
in one motion from
front to back.

335
00:14:37,453 --> 00:14:40,222
No, I do two in the front
and one in the back.

336
00:14:40,223 --> 00:14:42,885
- Yeah.
- Tap-tap one. One tap two.

337
00:14:42,886 --> 00:14:44,659
Yeah, that's what I do.

338
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,861
That's why...

339
00:14:46,862 --> 00:14:49,164
that's why we're
best friends, Jane!

340
00:14:49,165 --> 00:14:51,733
That's why, because...

341
00:14:51,734 --> 00:14:53,368
Lucy...

342
00:14:53,369 --> 00:14:56,004
Because we even
wipe the same way!

343
00:14:56,005 --> 00:14:58,773
And now we won't even
be wiping in the same...

344
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:01,344
- country!
- Okay.

345
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:06,115
Let... let's wash our hands.

346
00:15:07,777 --> 00:15:09,618
I love you.

347
00:15:11,352 --> 00:15:13,221
Okay, I have a confession.

348
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:14,918
Sometimes I blow
my nose in my shirt

349
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,358
when I'm working out.

350
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:19,527
Oh, okay, well, some
of those are my shirts!

351
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:21,363
I have a little
confession to make.

352
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:23,365
Okay.

353
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:26,068
Sometimes I go
pee in the shower.

354
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:27,402
Everyone pees in the shower!

355
00:15:27,403 --> 00:15:29,071
- Talk about...
- That's not a good one.

356
00:15:29,072 --> 00:15:31,106
- I have a confession.
- Oh, really?

357
00:15:31,107 --> 00:15:33,541
I kissed Amanda
Newman in tenth grade.

358
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:34,776
- Okay!
- Yeah.

359
00:15:34,777 --> 00:15:36,178
Thousand points for
that confession.

360
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:37,479
- Uh-huh.
- Wow.

361
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,942
Wait, what? You
never told me that.

362
00:15:38,943 --> 00:15:41,183
Yeah. Tenth grade,
behind 7-Eleven.

363
00:15:41,184 --> 00:15:42,750
She dared me to do
it and I did it.

364
00:15:42,751 --> 00:15:44,319
How could you not tell me that?

365
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,454
That's a big girl if
you kissed a deal.

366
00:15:46,455 --> 00:15:48,090
- Mmm?
- What?

367
00:15:48,091 --> 00:15:50,325
I mean, it's a big kiss
if you dealt a girl.

368
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:51,693
I mean...

369
00:15:51,694 --> 00:15:53,828
The third way to say that.

370
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:55,897
Why don't you take a little sip
of that water right there, honey?

371
00:15:55,898 --> 00:15:57,632
There you go. Good job.

372
00:15:57,633 --> 00:16:00,102
Yo, was she a good kisser?

373
00:16:00,103 --> 00:16:01,569
- She was pretty good.
- Mmm-hmm?

374
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,105
Yeah. She was.

375
00:16:03,106 --> 00:16:05,873
You never even said this
to me before, these words.

376
00:16:05,874 --> 00:16:07,142
I never heard them.

377
00:16:07,143 --> 00:16:09,278
Have you ever kissed
a girl before?

378
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:11,279
No.

379
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,015
Well, if you were
to kiss a girl...

380
00:16:13,016 --> 00:16:14,216
- Mmm-hmm.
- Who would it be?

381
00:16:14,217 --> 00:16:16,818
- Who would you kiss?
- Brittany.

382
00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:18,686
Brittany? That's interesting.

383
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,022
- Why is it... Who is...
- Yeah. Yeah.

384
00:16:20,023 --> 00:16:21,356
Who is... Who's Brit-Brit?

385
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:23,625
She's who does the
massages at my job.

386
00:16:23,626 --> 00:16:26,328
- Is she, uh, gay or straight?
- She's just... I don't know.

387
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:28,463
Maybe she's straight.
She wears dresses.

388
00:16:28,464 --> 00:16:31,299
Oh, you... Okay. You know
lesbians wear dresses, right?

389
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,168
She said she loved you today.

390
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:38,040
She is very, very flirty.
She likes to touch me.

391
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,841
Do you know what
she calls her? Luce.

392
00:16:39,842 --> 00:16:42,005
- Mmm.
- And she's just started working there.

393
00:16:42,006 --> 00:16:43,778
You should do it.

394
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:46,881
It is not a good idea to make out
with your coworkers, you guys.

395
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:48,083
Read the news.

396
00:16:48,084 --> 00:16:49,918
Right. I'm going to bed.

397
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,286
You always do that so abruptly.

398
00:16:51,287 --> 00:16:52,754
I know when it's time.

399
00:16:52,755 --> 00:16:54,489
Can we have a sleepover?

400
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,258
I don't... Mmm...

401
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:59,694
You better come and visit me.

402
00:16:59,695 --> 00:17:01,529
Yeah, I'll bring
you that sandwich

403
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:06,101
that you really love from
that shitty place on Sunset.

404
00:17:06,102 --> 00:17:08,603
Thank you.

405
00:17:08,604 --> 00:17:10,872
I'll put it in a cooler.

406
00:17:10,873 --> 00:17:14,709
It'll stay good on the
plane for 11 hours, right?

407
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,040
For sure.

408
00:17:23,852 --> 00:17:25,454
Are you crying?

409
00:17:26,554 --> 00:17:30,158
- No.
- Lucy...

410
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:33,395
I promise it's not
gonna be that different.

411
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:41,604
Don't cry.

412
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:47,242
We can FaceTime and
talk just like always.

413
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:53,249
Whoa. What's going on?

414
00:17:55,016 --> 00:17:56,385
Lucy...

415
00:18:02,758 --> 00:18:05,994
You know, when I said that I
would make out with Brittany...

416
00:18:05,995 --> 00:18:07,330
Yes?

417
00:18:08,897 --> 00:18:10,232
I really would.

418
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:12,334
I didn't think you
were lying about that.

419
00:18:12,335 --> 00:18:14,303
But, like...

420
00:18:17,071 --> 00:18:18,474
I really would.

421
00:18:22,911 --> 00:18:26,315
Like... Like, really?

422
00:18:28,249 --> 00:18:30,785
Yeah, I think so.

423
00:18:30,786 --> 00:18:34,622
{\an8}Oh, my God. Why didn't
you say anything?

424
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,859
{\an8}I just felt easier to
keep it buried inside.

425
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,263
{\an8}Fuck, Lucy. You can't
keep this inside.

426
00:18:41,264 --> 00:18:42,897
{\an8}You'll explode.

427
00:18:42,898 --> 00:18:44,232
I hate this.

428
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,642
Have you talked to
anyone about this?

429
00:18:55,576 --> 00:18:57,813
How long have you felt this way?

430
00:18:59,047 --> 00:19:00,348
A while.

431
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:02,784
And you never acted on it?

432
00:19:02,785 --> 00:19:04,853
Like, not even in secret?

433
00:19:05,954 --> 00:19:07,223
Oh!

434
00:19:08,123 --> 00:19:09,825
I feel so stupid.

435
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:16,498
Like... I should have
figured this out by now.

436
00:19:16,499 --> 00:19:18,200
You can't look at it that way.

437
00:19:18,201 --> 00:19:21,569
Yes, I can, Jane.
I'm 32 years old.

438
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,872
There's no timeline
to figuring it out.

439
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:27,276
People figure this out
when they're, like, nine.

440
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,077
Nine?

441
00:19:29,078 --> 00:19:31,513
{\an8}When I was nine, I
pretended I was a puppy

442
00:19:31,514 --> 00:19:33,548
{\an8}and I would only bark at people.

443
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:37,752
Yeah, that sounds strange
to say it out loud.

444
00:19:37,753 --> 00:19:39,787
I feel so stupid.

445
00:19:39,788 --> 00:19:43,425
And I don't even
know what I am.

446
00:19:43,426 --> 00:19:47,295
I don't even know if I'm...
if I'm really that way,

447
00:19:47,296 --> 00:19:49,731
and I'm just afraid to admit it,

448
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:52,100
or if I'm not, and
I just... What?

449
00:19:52,101 --> 00:19:55,870
I don't ever, like, date boys.

450
00:19:55,871 --> 00:19:57,906
I mean, men. I don't know.

451
00:19:57,907 --> 00:19:59,508
Well, maybe you're both.

452
00:20:05,446 --> 00:20:10,018
No. I just should've
figured it out.

453
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:14,656
When you kissed Amanda
Newman, did you like it?

454
00:20:14,657 --> 00:20:20,395
Oh, God, I guess. I had a
Zima. I thought I was drunk.

455
00:20:20,396 --> 00:20:24,332
But you weren't like,
"Maybe I'm gay?"

456
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,568
I don't know. I
wasn't gonna, like,

457
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:28,670
be with Amanda Newman.

458
00:20:28,671 --> 00:20:30,705
- Why? Why not?
- 'Cause...

459
00:20:30,706 --> 00:20:33,342
Well, it was just a dumb kiss.

460
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:38,546
So, when you kiss Danny,
are you thinking, like,

461
00:20:38,547 --> 00:20:40,882
"I'm so straight.
I love dudes?"

462
00:20:40,883 --> 00:20:44,954
Usually, I'm like, "Brush your
teeth. I can taste Subway."

463
00:20:45,887 --> 00:20:47,755
Seriously.

464
00:20:47,756 --> 00:20:50,926
I don't know if it's
so simple, Lucy.

465
00:20:50,927 --> 00:20:54,062
How have you felt
sleeping with guys?

466
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:55,430
Weird.

467
00:20:55,431 --> 00:20:57,365
Weird like you think
everything is weird

468
00:20:57,366 --> 00:21:00,102
or weird like you
just didn't like it?

469
00:21:00,103 --> 00:21:04,440
Weird like that must be the
reason I've barely done it.

470
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:09,877
Did you think that I was?

471
00:21:09,878 --> 00:21:11,713
A vagina lover?

472
00:21:11,714 --> 00:21:14,950
It crossed my mind.

473
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:16,751
I'm not. I don't... I...

474
00:21:16,752 --> 00:21:18,686
I don't love
vaginas. I'm not...

475
00:21:18,687 --> 00:21:21,523
You did own a Volvo
in high school.

476
00:21:21,524 --> 00:21:24,026
- You did.
- Jane, Volvos are

477
00:21:24,027 --> 00:21:26,594
- the safest car.
- Okay.

478
00:21:27,531 --> 00:21:30,565
Shit, Lucy, I'm sorry. I'm...

479
00:21:30,566 --> 00:21:32,334
I'm mad I never brought it up

480
00:21:32,335 --> 00:21:35,237
if it was hurting you this much.

481
00:21:35,238 --> 00:21:36,605
It's okay.

482
00:21:39,407 --> 00:21:41,977
I probably would have
just lied anyway.

483
00:21:41,978 --> 00:21:44,112
Well, now we know.

484
00:21:44,113 --> 00:21:48,311
And now, we've got to get you
to make out with Brit-Brit.

485
00:21:48,312 --> 00:21:50,418
I don't even know
if she likes girls.

486
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:53,088
Well, then we'll find
you some girls who do.

487
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:57,659
Lucy, from what I understand,
and I believe this to be true,

488
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,761
all lesbians know each other.

489
00:21:59,762 --> 00:22:01,796
They've all slept
with each other.

490
00:22:01,797 --> 00:22:03,966
So, for you to
enter into the fray,

491
00:22:03,967 --> 00:22:07,102
you're gonna be the star
of the lesbian community.

492
00:22:07,103 --> 00:22:08,236
I don't like that word.

493
00:22:08,237 --> 00:22:10,973
I know. "Community."

494
00:22:17,111 --> 00:22:18,947
I'm scared.

495
00:22:18,948 --> 00:22:20,616
Of course it's scary.

496
00:22:21,982 --> 00:22:24,987
But you think a lot
of things are scary.

497
00:22:24,988 --> 00:22:26,254
You still scared of how

498
00:22:26,255 --> 00:22:28,056
Salt-N-Pepa whisper in <i>Push It?</i>

499
00:22:28,057 --> 00:22:29,624
Yes. Very.

500
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:33,261
Look, I'd be scared to
touch someone else's vagina.

501
00:22:35,464 --> 00:22:38,067
But I'm not leaving this
country till you do.

502
00:22:45,308 --> 00:22:48,711
- I love you.
- I love you.

503
00:22:54,781 --> 00:22:58,286
Luce, you okay? What's wrong?

504
00:22:58,287 --> 00:23:01,556
Oh, yeah, I just had
too much tequila.

505
00:23:01,557 --> 00:23:03,691
Oh, give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

506
00:23:03,692 --> 00:23:06,294
I know a cure for a
hangover headache.

507
00:23:06,295 --> 00:23:08,296
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

508
00:23:08,297 --> 00:23:09,531
What'd you do last night?

509
00:23:09,532 --> 00:23:12,000
- Did you have a hot date?
- Mmm, no.

510
00:23:12,001 --> 00:23:15,537
Uh, Jane told me she's
moving to London,

511
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:18,140
so I got shit-faced.

512
00:23:18,141 --> 00:23:20,976
Oh, Luce, I'm sorry,

513
00:23:20,977 --> 00:23:24,046
but, um, I mean,
that... that...

514
00:23:24,047 --> 00:23:25,347
Well, it sucks.

515
00:23:25,348 --> 00:23:27,649
It's fine. It's okay. Um...

516
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,686
Probably not
helping my headache.

517
00:23:33,854 --> 00:23:36,791
- Is that too much?
- No, it's so nice.

518
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:39,062
Well, we can hang out more.

519
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:42,264
Unless you...

520
00:23:42,265 --> 00:23:43,365
- Oh, no.
- Don't want to.

521
00:23:43,366 --> 00:23:45,533
No, no. I'd love to.

522
00:23:45,534 --> 00:23:48,136
Okay, good.

523
00:23:48,137 --> 00:23:49,872
Because I'm a lot of fun.

524
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:52,675
More later?

525
00:24:10,424 --> 00:24:11,627
No.

526
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:43,591
Have you ever fucked
an Uber driver?

527
00:24:43,592 --> 00:24:44,892
- No.
- That's so something

528
00:24:44,893 --> 00:24:46,361
Drew would do.

529
00:24:46,362 --> 00:24:47,629
You know Drew.

530
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,097
Which one's Drew?

531
00:24:49,098 --> 00:24:50,265
I've talked about him.

532
00:24:50,266 --> 00:24:51,599
He's the one who only
talks on speakerphone.

533
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,201
He's the fucking worst.

534
00:24:53,202 --> 00:24:55,537
I'd still fuck him, though.

535
00:24:55,538 --> 00:24:56,804
Maybe I should try to do that

536
00:24:56,805 --> 00:24:58,606
- before we leave for London.
- Mmm.

537
00:24:58,607 --> 00:25:00,175
Oh, you're gonna
go to London, too?

538
00:25:00,176 --> 00:25:03,506
- Yeah, I told you that.
- Mmm-mmm. No, you didn't.

539
00:25:03,507 --> 00:25:05,713
I can't wait to go
and be on Jane's team!

540
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,282
I'm so excited! Girls.

541
00:25:07,283 --> 00:25:10,652
Say Vegemite! "Vegemite."

542
00:25:10,653 --> 00:25:11,920
That's Australian.

543
00:25:11,921 --> 00:25:13,656
Love It. Storying
it. Posting it.

544
00:25:14,955 --> 00:25:16,925
I'm fully going bi
when I go to London.

545
00:25:16,926 --> 00:25:19,561
The girls are so
fucking hot there.

546
00:25:19,562 --> 00:25:21,363
Wait. Are you,
uh, seeing anyone?

547
00:25:21,364 --> 00:25:23,065
Uh, no, not right now.

548
00:25:23,066 --> 00:25:24,967
Did you guys know I've only
been with seven people?

549
00:25:24,968 --> 00:25:26,734
- Really?
- Isn't that crazy?

550
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:29,471
My number's nine, including
Danny. And I feel like...

551
00:25:29,472 --> 00:25:30,805
Danny needs to let
you get to ten.

552
00:25:30,806 --> 00:25:32,640
- Right?
- He needs to.

553
00:25:32,641 --> 00:25:34,210
How many people
have you slept with?

554
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:36,511
Um...

555
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,812
- Um...
- Too many to count?

556
00:25:37,813 --> 00:25:40,582
- No, no, no. I...
- I wish I was like you,

557
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,284
but we have the same
hair, so I'm on my way.

558
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:45,187
I love this shirt!

559
00:25:45,188 --> 00:25:46,549
- Oh, really?
- Mmm-hmm.

560
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,056
- Thanks.
- Where'd you get it?

561
00:25:48,057 --> 00:25:49,724
It's probably from the
Gap. Is it from the Gap?

562
00:25:49,725 --> 00:25:51,259
Aw, the Gap.

563
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,961
Um, actually, I think it is.

564
00:25:52,962 --> 00:25:54,597
Aw, the Gap.

565
00:25:56,665 --> 00:25:58,600
- J? J?
- Hmm?

566
00:25:58,601 --> 00:26:00,068
You have something
in your teeth.

567
00:26:00,069 --> 00:26:02,004
- Oh. Thank you.
- Perfect. You got it.

568
00:26:02,005 --> 00:26:04,472
I always tell people when they
have something in their teeth.

569
00:26:04,473 --> 00:26:06,041
I think it's like the
most important thing

570
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:07,675
- you can do for a friend.
- I totally agree.

571
00:26:07,676 --> 00:26:09,344
I think it's so important.

572
00:26:09,345 --> 00:26:11,914
I mean, it's not like the most
important thing you can do.

573
00:26:11,915 --> 00:26:13,715
I, like... I didn't see it.

574
00:26:13,716 --> 00:26:16,084
I would have said
something if I saw it, J.

575
00:26:16,085 --> 00:26:18,020
<i>♪ Will you come visit us? ♪</i>

576
00:26:18,021 --> 00:26:20,088
<i>♪ Will you come to London? ♪</i>

577
00:26:20,089 --> 00:26:21,189
Will you come?

578
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,586
Well, yeah, I hope
so. We'll see.

579
00:26:23,587 --> 00:26:25,827
Wait, guys. I have a
friend from college

580
00:26:25,828 --> 00:26:27,129
who knows a bunch of the royals.

581
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,363
We should follow
them on Instagram.

582
00:26:28,364 --> 00:26:29,864
Jane hates Instagram.

583
00:26:29,865 --> 00:26:32,434
I don't hate it. I just
don't go on it a ton.

584
00:26:32,435 --> 00:26:34,970
Well, I hope you like big,
random dinner parties.

585
00:26:34,971 --> 00:26:36,972
- Yeah, I love!
- What?

586
00:26:36,973 --> 00:26:38,740
You absolutely hate
dinner parties.

587
00:26:38,741 --> 00:26:41,243
This is different. When
you're abroad, it's different.

588
00:26:41,244 --> 00:26:43,145
When you're abroad,
everything's different.

589
00:26:43,146 --> 00:26:45,647
Everything is different
when you're abroad.

590
00:26:45,648 --> 00:26:47,750
I can't wait to
meet Jane's family!

591
00:26:49,383 --> 00:26:51,719
- Isn't Kat the best?
- She's the best.

592
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,021
You hate her.

593
00:26:53,022 --> 00:26:55,523
I don't hate her,
but she's just a lot.

594
00:26:55,524 --> 00:26:57,059
Yeah, but I like it.

595
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,161
You gals are gonna have
fun in London, aren't you?

596
00:26:59,162 --> 00:27:02,497
Oh, I almost forgot.
I got muffins.

597
00:27:02,498 --> 00:27:04,333
Ooh!

598
00:27:05,466 --> 00:27:07,469
- Bluebs?
- A bluebs and a bran.

599
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,872
We each have half of one now
and half when we're done.

600
00:27:10,873 --> 00:27:12,507
I can't have a whole one now?

601
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:14,109
No, half and half.

602
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,577
And then we have a snack
waiting for us when we're done.

603
00:27:15,578 --> 00:27:16,744
It's the smart way to do it.

604
00:27:16,745 --> 00:27:18,280
It's the controlling
way to do it.

605
00:27:18,281 --> 00:27:20,482
I'm the thoughtful one
who bought muffins.

606
00:27:20,483 --> 00:27:22,617
Which one do you want?

607
00:27:22,618 --> 00:27:24,152
Bran or bluebs?

608
00:27:24,153 --> 00:27:25,420
Bran, obviously.

609
00:27:25,421 --> 00:27:27,290
End with the bluebs.

610
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,226
I guess I'll have bran.

611
00:27:31,227 --> 00:27:33,128
We need to figure
out your type.

612
00:27:33,129 --> 00:27:34,396
No, no.

613
00:27:34,397 --> 00:27:36,031
Why does she touch me so much?

614
00:27:36,032 --> 00:27:37,966
- You mean Brit-Brit?
- Yeah.

615
00:27:37,967 --> 00:27:40,635
'Cause she wants to
have sex with you.

616
00:27:40,636 --> 00:27:43,638
It's like way
more than normal.

617
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:44,839
Look, here's the bottom line.

618
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,974
You can use this chick

619
00:27:45,975 --> 00:27:47,309
- as a sexual portal.
- Why?

620
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,977
But this isn't a
lasting relationship.

621
00:27:48,978 --> 00:27:50,278
Touch her stuff, roll around.

622
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:51,746
Then we've got to
get you on those apps

623
00:27:51,747 --> 00:27:52,948
so people know their
way around your area.

624
00:27:52,949 --> 00:27:54,482
I do not want to do that.

625
00:27:54,483 --> 00:27:56,118
Can I ask you something?

626
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:59,454
Why don't you think you have
to date like everyone else?

627
00:27:59,455 --> 00:28:01,189
No one's gonna ring on
your doorbell one day,

628
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,657
looking for a
wishy-washy lesbian

629
00:28:02,658 --> 00:28:04,026
who might want to
try some stuff.

630
00:28:04,027 --> 00:28:06,194
You don't know that for sure.

631
00:28:06,195 --> 00:28:08,463
Come on, two at a time.
Squeeze your cheeks.

632
00:28:08,464 --> 00:28:10,898
This is different.

633
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:12,267
How is it different?

634
00:28:12,268 --> 00:28:14,836
Because, what if somebody
I know is on there

635
00:28:14,837 --> 00:28:16,939
and then they're like,
"What? She's gay?"

636
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,674
- Then what?
- Then everybody knows.

637
00:28:19,675 --> 00:28:21,443
Great!

638
00:28:21,444 --> 00:28:22,810
It's not like people know you

639
00:28:22,811 --> 00:28:25,280
as this tried and
true heterosexual.

640
00:28:25,281 --> 00:28:28,750
You never let anyone set
you up, you don't date.

641
00:28:28,751 --> 00:28:30,118
People will be like,

642
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:32,320
"Oh, good. She
figured it out."

643
00:28:32,321 --> 00:28:34,022
Do you think people
are thinking that?

644
00:28:34,023 --> 00:28:35,457
I don't know!

645
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:38,927
Everyone is just gonna
want you to be happy.

646
00:28:38,928 --> 00:28:41,329
What if I'm not
meant to be happy?

647
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,165
Oh, my God.

648
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:46,101
I'm running up there, and
I am not coming back down.

649
00:28:46,102 --> 00:28:47,136
Fine.

650
00:28:49,537 --> 00:28:51,439
I'm sitting here.

651
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,041
Have I ever been happy?

652
00:28:53,042 --> 00:28:55,510
I don't even know
what makes me happy.

653
00:28:55,511 --> 00:28:57,645
I'm nervous all the time.

654
00:28:57,646 --> 00:29:00,415
And I'm scared of everything.

655
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:02,184
Lucy, these are
lame fucking excuses

656
00:29:02,185 --> 00:29:04,452
so you don't have to step
outside of your comfort zone.

657
00:29:04,453 --> 00:29:06,354
You're more than
capable of being happy.

658
00:29:06,355 --> 00:29:08,423
Don't spew that bullshit at me.

659
00:29:08,424 --> 00:29:12,394
I'm being vulnerable right
now and you're attacking me.

660
00:29:12,395 --> 00:29:15,730
Squeeze. You're not even
comfortable in your comfort zone.

661
00:29:15,731 --> 00:29:18,133
So, why not just
try something new?

662
00:29:18,134 --> 00:29:19,935
You try 20 different
flavors of ice cream

663
00:29:19,936 --> 00:29:22,704
before you settle on a
single scoop. Do that.

664
00:29:22,705 --> 00:29:25,673
Ice cream is different
than a vagina.

665
00:29:25,674 --> 00:29:27,509
How do you know?
You don't know.

666
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,044
Yeah, I do know.

667
00:29:29,045 --> 00:29:32,215
Otherwise, it would be
called vagice cream.

668
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:37,085
Am I okay?

669
00:29:37,086 --> 00:29:39,254
I don't want to be this
thing that's different.

670
00:29:39,255 --> 00:29:43,491
I don't want to have to tell
everybody this big thing. It's...

671
00:29:43,492 --> 00:29:47,230
I know that it's fine, and
no one cares, but I care,

672
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:49,397
and I'm late.

673
00:29:49,398 --> 00:29:51,733
It's so late in life.

674
00:29:51,734 --> 00:29:54,903
Then don't waste any more time.

675
00:29:54,904 --> 00:29:57,705
I just wish I didn't
think about her so much.

676
00:29:57,706 --> 00:29:59,275
You think about her a lot?

677
00:30:00,574 --> 00:30:04,746
Lucy, you're gonna be fine.

678
00:30:04,747 --> 00:30:08,216
Let's go to a gay bar one
night and have a look around.

679
00:30:08,217 --> 00:30:11,354
I'm sure there's a place with
some kind of lesbian jamboree.

680
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,289
The Womb.

681
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,958
You know it's called the Womb.

682
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:18,193
I've never been more
proud of you. We're going.

683
00:30:18,194 --> 00:30:20,395
No. I'm not ready for that.

684
00:30:20,396 --> 00:30:23,465
Please, it'll be
fun. It's research.

685
00:30:23,466 --> 00:30:26,001
Can I please have the other
half of my muffin now?

686
00:30:26,002 --> 00:30:27,402
And do you want to mention

687
00:30:27,403 --> 00:30:29,671
how much better it is
to end with bluebs?

688
00:30:29,672 --> 00:30:31,539
Don't ignore me, Denise!

689
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:35,839
You gotta start shaving
above da knees, Denise.

690
00:31:32,132 --> 00:31:35,070
- Hey, pretty. Whatcha doing?
- Oh, um, just...

691
00:31:35,071 --> 00:31:37,705
I was just googling things.

692
00:31:37,706 --> 00:31:39,903
Totally random.

693
00:31:39,904 --> 00:31:41,477
Just totally random stuff.

694
00:31:43,744 --> 00:31:46,081
Oh, Luce, you are so talented.

695
00:31:46,082 --> 00:31:47,382
What?

696
00:31:47,383 --> 00:31:48,984
Like, what are you
even doing here?

697
00:31:50,086 --> 00:31:51,453
Good question.

698
00:31:51,454 --> 00:31:54,957
Actually, I paint.
That's what I like to do.

699
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:56,920
Well, I want to
see your paintings.

700
00:31:56,921 --> 00:31:58,326
Oh...

701
00:31:58,327 --> 00:32:00,295
No. I mean, I don't
have any of them here.

702
00:32:00,296 --> 00:32:02,064
I didn't think you
had them with you.

703
00:32:02,065 --> 00:32:03,565
Can you imagine?

704
00:32:03,566 --> 00:32:05,767
I just pull out, like,
12 from under the table.

705
00:32:07,503 --> 00:32:11,106
I wanna see your paintings
because I bet they're amazing.

706
00:32:11,107 --> 00:32:13,375
Yeah, maybe one day.

707
00:32:13,376 --> 00:32:14,939
Well, when are we
gonna hang out?

708
00:32:15,438 --> 00:32:16,438
Um...

709
00:32:16,944 --> 00:32:17,942
whenever.

710
00:32:17,943 --> 00:32:20,315
Okay. Tonight?

711
00:32:20,316 --> 00:32:23,185
Sure, I can do tonight.
I can make that work.

712
00:32:23,186 --> 00:32:26,421
Okay, well, I'll cook.

713
00:32:26,422 --> 00:32:28,657
Squee! I'm so excited.

714
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:46,042
Bitch.

715
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:52,014
Oh, my God. All the time.

716
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:55,183
- Really?
- Yes.

717
00:32:55,184 --> 00:32:58,286
Like, boner after boner
after sad little boner.

718
00:32:58,287 --> 00:32:59,521
Wow.

719
00:32:59,522 --> 00:33:01,490
Do they ever ask you to, like...

720
00:33:02,857 --> 00:33:04,226
diddle them?

721
00:33:04,227 --> 00:33:05,928
Some.

722
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:06,990
I've diddled.

723
00:33:06,991 --> 00:33:08,830
I diddled. One time.

724
00:33:08,831 --> 00:33:10,532
- You did?
- Yes.

725
00:33:10,533 --> 00:33:13,068
I mean, I had to try
it at some point.

726
00:33:13,069 --> 00:33:14,802
And he was cute.
So, it was fine.

727
00:33:14,803 --> 00:33:16,905
Wow. Did he tip you?

728
00:33:16,906 --> 00:33:18,206
Oh, fuck, yeah.

729
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:20,175
But that was it.
That was all I did.

730
00:33:20,176 --> 00:33:21,576
That's why I'm
saying. Like, really,

731
00:33:21,577 --> 00:33:24,913
I wanna open a
female-only studio.

732
00:33:24,914 --> 00:33:27,950
They're just...
They're better.

733
00:33:27,951 --> 00:33:29,351
I bet not so many hairy backs.

734
00:33:29,352 --> 00:33:32,854
You'd be surprised.

735
00:33:32,855 --> 00:33:34,457
No, they're, um...

736
00:33:35,323 --> 00:33:36,692
They're much softer.

737
00:33:39,455 --> 00:33:42,297
Oh, my God!

738
00:33:42,298 --> 00:33:44,433
What's your longest
relationship?

739
00:33:45,432 --> 00:33:49,304
I don't know. Not long.

740
00:33:49,305 --> 00:33:52,441
Like, months. A
couple of months.

741
00:33:53,307 --> 00:33:54,842
Have you ever been in love?

742
00:33:54,843 --> 00:33:56,179
Mmm!

743
00:33:57,345 --> 00:33:59,481
- Really?
- No.

744
00:33:59,482 --> 00:34:03,585
Oh, I'm kinda jealous. Like,
you have something great

745
00:34:03,586 --> 00:34:04,886
to look forward to.

746
00:34:04,887 --> 00:34:07,289
- Have you?
- Oh, yeah.

747
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:09,624
My college boyfriend.

748
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:12,427
I was obsessed with him,
and I thought that, like,

749
00:34:12,428 --> 00:34:14,729
if he broke up with
me, I would die.

750
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,564
Like, literally die.

751
00:34:16,565 --> 00:34:17,799
What happened?

752
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,435
He moved to Portland,
then he broke up with me.

753
00:34:20,436 --> 00:34:23,271
And then I didn't die, so...

754
00:34:23,272 --> 00:34:25,068
Cheers to that.

755
00:34:25,069 --> 00:34:26,574
And then I realized

756
00:34:26,575 --> 00:34:29,711
that I should probably
have sex with more people.

757
00:34:29,712 --> 00:34:30,779
So...

758
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,681
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

759
00:34:33,682 --> 00:34:34,849
Do you miss him?

760
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,919
Mmm... No.

761
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,354
I mean, I see him sometimes.

762
00:34:39,355 --> 00:34:41,456
I feel like he's a weirdo.

763
00:34:41,457 --> 00:34:44,859
And I think that he's gay, so...

764
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,195
Really?

765
00:34:47,095 --> 00:34:48,896
I don't know.

766
00:34:48,897 --> 00:34:51,266
It's a spectrum, right?

767
00:34:51,267 --> 00:34:55,203
Gay, straight, bi. What
does it even all mean?

768
00:34:55,204 --> 00:34:56,638
I think in that case,

769
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,207
it means you're either
gay, straight or bi.

770
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:02,105
You're funny.

771
00:35:02,106 --> 00:35:03,879
You're funny.

772
00:35:05,913 --> 00:35:10,185
I mean, I think everyone falls
somewhere on the spectrum.

773
00:35:10,186 --> 00:35:12,587
Like, I know I'm
on the spectrum.

774
00:35:12,588 --> 00:35:15,558
You're on the spectrum,
don't you think?

775
00:35:17,025 --> 00:35:19,562
- Probably.
- Hmm. Love is love.

776
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,269
Have you ever made
out with a girl?

777
00:35:30,271 --> 00:35:32,074
You haven't?

778
00:35:32,075 --> 00:35:33,875
- No.
- What?

779
00:35:33,876 --> 00:35:34,943
Why do you say that?

780
00:35:34,944 --> 00:35:38,480
No, I just, like... I assumed.

781
00:35:38,481 --> 00:35:41,049
Because you're a
woman with the times.

782
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,684
What?

783
00:35:42,685 --> 00:35:44,319
What does that mean?

784
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,188
I don't know. I
just feel like...

785
00:35:46,189 --> 00:35:48,557
everyone should try
it at some point.

786
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:50,859
Have you?

787
00:35:51,593 --> 00:35:52,595
No.

788
00:35:53,828 --> 00:35:54,897
Not yet.

789
00:36:01,335 --> 00:36:02,738
Show me one of your paintings.

790
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:05,740
Um...

791
00:36:05,741 --> 00:36:07,809
And then I'll leave
after. I promise.

792
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,144
You don't have to go.

793
00:36:09,145 --> 00:36:10,145
Uh, I mean, you don't
have to do that.

794
00:36:10,146 --> 00:36:11,879
Okay.

795
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,649
- Just one.
- Fine.

796
00:36:18,153 --> 00:36:20,055
- There's...
- Ooh.

797
00:36:20,056 --> 00:36:22,891
This is so cool.

798
00:36:23,591 --> 00:36:25,494
I love that you paint.

799
00:36:26,027 --> 00:36:28,296
Oh, my God.

800
00:36:28,297 --> 00:36:30,298
Lucy.

801
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:32,067
They're old.
They're really old.

802
00:36:32,068 --> 00:36:34,269
I haven't painted
in a long time.

803
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:36,405
This is what you
should be doing.

804
00:36:37,605 --> 00:36:39,342
I don't know.

805
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:45,781
I should go.

806
00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:52,620
This was fun.

807
00:36:52,621 --> 00:36:54,856
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right?

808
00:36:54,857 --> 00:36:56,691
Um, we should do it more.

809
00:36:56,692 --> 00:36:58,794
- Totally. Yeah.
- Yeah.

810
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,935
Good night.

811
00:37:06,936 --> 00:37:08,271
Night-night.

812
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,883
"Night-night?" What?

813
00:37:21,884 --> 00:37:27,155
When you let go and start to
embrace who you really are,

814
00:37:27,156 --> 00:37:29,457
that's when you start to open up

815
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:33,061
your hearts and your bodies.

816
00:37:33,062 --> 00:37:35,797
Today, I want you to remember

817
00:37:35,798 --> 00:37:39,367
to lead with hope
and not with fear.

818
00:37:39,368 --> 00:37:41,403
Fear only holds you back.

819
00:37:41,404 --> 00:37:43,538
I don't know. I didn't
ask her to stay.

820
00:37:43,539 --> 00:37:46,374
Maybe I should have.

821
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:48,843
I don't like this.
You have shaky voice.

822
00:37:48,844 --> 00:37:49,945
No, I don't.

823
00:37:49,946 --> 00:37:52,080
- Yes, you do.
- God, it's just weird.

824
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:55,017
It's all... weird.

825
00:37:55,018 --> 00:37:57,319
I'm weird. I hate this.

826
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,754
How close was the kiss?

827
00:37:59,287 --> 00:38:00,422
Like, close.

828
00:38:00,423 --> 00:38:02,190
Show me where?

829
00:38:02,191 --> 00:38:04,092
Like, here.

830
00:38:04,093 --> 00:38:05,994
That's pretty close.

831
00:38:05,995 --> 00:38:08,063
I don't know about this bitch.
If she's fucking with you,

832
00:38:08,064 --> 00:38:09,331
I'll fuck her shit up.

833
00:38:09,332 --> 00:38:11,099
Do you think she's gay?

834
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,635
I have no idea.

835
00:38:13,636 --> 00:38:15,603
But, like, if you
had to guess...

836
00:38:15,604 --> 00:38:16,972
I mean, I've never kissed

837
00:38:16,973 --> 00:38:19,475
a platonic girlfriend
on a mouth corner.

838
00:38:22,078 --> 00:38:24,980
She said women have soft backs.

839
00:38:24,981 --> 00:38:28,250
Ew. Jesus. What? And
you drank white wine?

840
00:38:28,251 --> 00:38:30,453
Lucy, I'm genuinely alarmed.

841
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:33,755
Maybe she's more
confused than I am.

842
00:38:33,756 --> 00:38:34,756
Maybe.

843
00:38:34,757 --> 00:38:36,691
But you need someone who knows.

844
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:38,060
Two people trying to figure out
if they're lesbians together,

845
00:38:38,061 --> 00:38:39,727
that might be the worst
idea I've ever heard.

846
00:38:39,728 --> 00:38:41,129
That's why we're
going to the Womb.

847
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,364
- No.
- Yes.

848
00:38:42,365 --> 00:38:43,631
- I don't want to.
- We're finding you

849
00:38:43,632 --> 00:38:44,933
- a girlfriend before I leave.
- Please.

850
00:38:59,314 --> 00:39:00,917
<i>♪ Heart to break... ♪</i>

851
00:39:03,151 --> 00:39:04,752
I'd make a great lesbian.

852
00:39:04,753 --> 00:39:06,888
That's the real
shame in all of this.

853
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:08,090
How are you doing?

854
00:39:08,091 --> 00:39:10,592
Good. Great.

855
00:39:10,593 --> 00:39:13,396
This girl's cute. She's
cute. She's cute, she's cute.

856
00:39:14,463 --> 00:39:15,398

00:39:15,399 --> 00:39:16,799

00:39:29,645 --> 00:39:32,615
- So, um...
- Okay.

864
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:35,150
- Go with her.
- What?

865
00:39:35,151 --> 00:39:36,684
Why did you do that to me?

866
00:39:36,685 --> 00:39:40,455
Oh, my God! Because
you never do anything.

867
00:39:40,456 --> 00:39:42,758

00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,821
<i>Right, so, I thought we'd
have a quick debrief...</i>

879
00:40:46,822 --> 00:40:48,623
He sounds so fucking hot.

880
00:40:48,624 --> 00:40:51,093
<i>Jeremy from accounts.</i>

881
00:40:51,094 --> 00:40:52,760
<i>Uh, there were a few...</i>

882
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:05,407
<i>- And there are...</i>
- Yeah.

883
00:41:05,408 --> 00:41:06,808
<i>Some responsibilities</i>

884
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:08,276
<i>that I'm gonna run
up the flagpole</i>

885
00:41:08,277 --> 00:41:09,744
<i>and see if they will
fall in your lap.</i>

886
00:41:09,745 --> 00:41:11,475
Yeah, we can have
that by tomorrow.

887
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:16,952
<i>They want us to focus on it.</i>

888
00:41:16,953 --> 00:41:18,481
<i>So, I'm just giving you
a heads-up for that.</i>

889
00:41:18,482 --> 00:41:20,188
Uh-huh!

890
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:37,973
<i>...we can tie up together.</i>

891
00:41:37,974 --> 00:41:39,641
<i>I don't think they need to
be as dispersed as they are.</i>

892
00:41:39,642 --> 00:41:40,875
<i>But that's just
the best practice.</i>

893
00:41:40,876 --> 00:41:42,745
- Uh-huh.
<i>- You know?</i>

894
00:41:45,614 --> 00:41:47,349
Whatcha doin'?

895
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:49,151
Oh, nothing. I'm just...

896
00:41:49,152 --> 00:41:52,754
Dumb online shopping.

897
00:41:52,755 --> 00:41:54,257
That one's kinda cute.

898
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:58,460
Oh, I'm not really a...

899
00:41:58,461 --> 00:42:00,762
hole in the shoulders
kind of girl.

900
00:42:00,763 --> 00:42:02,030
Well, you only need

901
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:03,999
one good shoulder
for that shirt.

902
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,134
- And you have two.
- Oh?

903
00:42:06,135 --> 00:42:09,137
- Mmm-hmm.
- Thanks.

904
00:42:09,138 --> 00:42:11,206
I just had the best idea.

905
00:42:11,207 --> 00:42:14,509
- Does it involve my shoulders?
- Yeah, it does.

906
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,278
We should have a try-on party.

907
00:42:16,279 --> 00:42:17,845
What's a try-on party?

908
00:42:17,846 --> 00:42:22,545
Like, try-on-my-clothes party.

909
00:42:22,546 --> 00:42:23,685
I love fashion.

910
00:42:23,686 --> 00:42:25,120
I should've been a stylist.

911
00:42:25,121 --> 00:42:27,155
Whatever. That's not even
what we're talking about.

912
00:42:27,156 --> 00:42:28,256
We'll have some wine.

913
00:42:28,257 --> 00:42:30,125
You try on my clothes
that I never wear

914
00:42:30,126 --> 00:42:33,061
and if you like them,
you can keep them.

915
00:42:33,062 --> 00:42:35,297
- Did you just make that up?
- Mmm-mmm.

916
00:42:35,298 --> 00:42:37,299
Everybody has try-on parties.

917
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:40,002
Really? I... I don't
think that's true.

918
00:42:40,003 --> 00:42:40,970
It is true!

919
00:42:40,971 --> 00:42:42,737
Doesn't it sound fun, though?

920
00:42:42,738 --> 00:42:44,839
Do you have a lot of pants?

921
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,241
Lucy, this is like a...

922
00:42:46,242 --> 00:42:49,477
No. It's like you need
more colors and pattern.

923
00:42:49,478 --> 00:42:51,680
Introduce new
things to your life.

924
00:42:53,414 --> 00:42:54,882
<i>And you CC'd me on that?</i>

925
00:42:54,883 --> 00:42:56,352
- Yeah.
- Okay.

926
00:42:57,552 --> 00:42:59,487
Hi. They didn't
have any, um...

927
00:42:59,488 --> 00:43:01,756
Hi!

928
00:43:01,757 --> 00:43:03,891
- Oh, it's so good to see you!
- Hi.

929
00:43:03,892 --> 00:43:05,928
I love this jacket.

930
00:43:05,929 --> 00:43:09,364
Thanks. Thank you.
I love your dress?

931
00:43:09,365 --> 00:43:11,633
- I designed it.
- No way.

932
00:43:11,634 --> 00:43:12,901
- Yeah.
- That's so nice.

933
00:43:12,902 --> 00:43:14,102
- How are you?
- I'm good.

934
00:43:14,103 --> 00:43:15,570
- How are you?
- I'm so good.

935
00:43:15,571 --> 00:43:18,073
I'm so excited for my girl.

936
00:43:18,074 --> 00:43:19,602
Get your food and eat with us.

937
00:43:19,603 --> 00:43:20,875
Oh, no, no. You guys go do

938
00:43:20,876 --> 00:43:23,712
your cute little thing.

939
00:43:26,981 --> 00:43:28,850
I can't believe you just
asked her to eat with us.

940
00:43:28,851 --> 00:43:31,019
Oh, stop. I knew she wouldn't.

941
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,520
Well, I'm sure she'd love to be

942
00:43:32,521 --> 00:43:35,857
in the middle of our
little "cute little thing."

943
00:43:35,858 --> 00:43:37,592
I have so much shit
to get through.

944
00:43:37,593 --> 00:43:39,995
They just asked if I
could leave earlier.

945
00:43:39,996 --> 00:43:42,830
- I'm not going to.
- Good.

946
00:43:42,831 --> 00:43:45,400
Can they send
Kat? Like, today?

947
00:43:45,401 --> 00:43:46,629
I'll go pack her things.

948
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:49,071
All right. Enough
with that already.

949
00:43:49,072 --> 00:43:51,773
All right, well, maybe
I'm just a little bit sad

950
00:43:51,774 --> 00:43:54,176
that my best friend is
moving across the world.

951
00:43:54,177 --> 00:43:55,743
Well, maybe you could
be happy for me.

952
00:43:55,744 --> 00:43:57,312
That's what best friends
are supposed to do.

953
00:43:57,313 --> 00:43:59,547
- I am happy for you.
- Then act like it.

954
00:43:59,548 --> 00:44:03,052
Are you serious right now?
When am I not happy for you?

955
00:44:08,389 --> 00:44:10,858
Ooh. Ooh.

956
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:12,427
I'm not doing this now.

957
00:44:12,428 --> 00:44:14,129
Oh, you're not doing this now?

958
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:16,164
When would be better
for you to do this?

959
00:44:16,165 --> 00:44:18,533
Since everything is
always on your schedule.

960
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:19,734
I'm at work.

961
00:44:19,735 --> 00:44:20,835
I don't know what
happens at a spa,

962
00:44:20,836 --> 00:44:22,037
but we're professionals here.

963
00:44:22,038 --> 00:44:23,906
Oh, nice. You got a dig in.

964
00:44:23,907 --> 00:44:25,773
Any other judgments
you want to share?

965
00:44:25,774 --> 00:44:27,209
- Oh, please.
- What?

966
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:28,944
You want to boss me
around a little bit more?

967
00:44:28,945 --> 00:44:30,412
- Boss...
- Tell me how to live my life?

968
00:44:30,413 --> 00:44:31,846
Boss you around?

969
00:44:31,847 --> 00:44:32,676
You're free to do whatever
the fuck you want.

970
00:44:32,677 --> 00:44:33,916
Oh, well...

971
00:44:33,917 --> 00:44:36,018
I know you take that to heart.

972
00:44:36,019 --> 00:44:37,419
What's that supposed to mean?

973
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,421
You always do whatever
the fuck you want.

974
00:44:39,422 --> 00:44:42,257
You feel like making out
with some girl at a club,

975
00:44:42,258 --> 00:44:44,126
then you make out with
some girl at a club.

976
00:44:44,127 --> 00:44:46,128
She asked if she could
kiss me, so I said yes.

977
00:44:46,129 --> 00:44:47,862
Because it's more
fun to say yes.

978
00:44:47,863 --> 00:44:49,297
If you wanted to, you
could've done the same thing.

979
00:44:49,298 --> 00:44:51,099
Why? So you could tell
me I was doing it wrong?

980
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,336
Oh, my God, Lucy, do
shit however you want.

981
00:44:54,337 --> 00:44:56,171
I am not your keeper.

982
00:44:56,172 --> 00:44:58,473
What? You're always
controlling me.

983
00:44:58,474 --> 00:44:59,908
You control everything I do.

984
00:44:59,909 --> 00:45:01,743
You told me when I could
eat a fucking muffin.

985
00:45:01,744 --> 00:45:03,211
Yeah, because if I didn't
tell you what to do,

986
00:45:03,212 --> 00:45:04,779
you'd probably never
leave the house.

987
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,348
You can't make any
decisions on your own.

988
00:45:06,349 --> 00:45:07,916
You don't do anything.

989
00:45:07,917 --> 00:45:09,151
You can't even decide what
gender of the human race

990
00:45:09,152 --> 00:45:11,353
- you want to fuck.
- Fuck you.

991
00:45:11,354 --> 00:45:12,715
You probably do want to fuck me.

992
00:45:12,716 --> 00:45:14,089
- What?
- Everyone thinks that.

993
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:15,958
What are you talking about?

994
00:45:15,959 --> 00:45:17,525
We're not a couple, Lucy.

995
00:45:17,526 --> 00:45:20,295
Nobody thinks we're a
couple. What? Are you insane?

996
00:45:20,296 --> 00:45:22,064
People think we're,
like, confusing twins.

997
00:45:22,065 --> 00:45:23,665
What... what the fuck
is wrong with you?

998
00:45:23,666 --> 00:45:25,333
What the fuck is wrong with you?

999
00:45:25,334 --> 00:45:27,002
You can't even handle the fact
that I have another friend.

1000
00:45:27,003 --> 00:45:28,603
Oh, what a fun friend.

1001
00:45:28,604 --> 00:45:30,338
You know what? At least
Kat talks about things.

1002
00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:32,074
Yeah. It was really
thrilling to find out

1003
00:45:32,075 --> 00:45:34,076
that she can suck a
dick and order Postmates

1004
00:45:34,077 --> 00:45:35,944
- at the same time.
- That was thrilling.

1005
00:45:35,945 --> 00:45:38,246
And it's fun to hear
crazy fucking stories

1006
00:45:38,247 --> 00:45:40,648
instead of wallowing in
sorrow the whole time.

1007
00:45:40,649 --> 00:45:41,917
At some point you're gonna have

1008
00:45:41,918 --> 00:45:43,351
to pull your head
out of your own ass.

1009
00:45:43,352 --> 00:45:44,586
You think Kat could
teach me how to do that?

1010
00:45:44,587 --> 00:45:45,853
I bet you she's tried.

1011
00:45:45,854 --> 00:45:47,855
Real friends tell
each other shit.

1012
00:45:47,856 --> 00:45:49,157
I tell you everything.

1013
00:45:49,158 --> 00:45:51,626
Except the most important thing.

1014
00:45:51,627 --> 00:45:53,128
It's not about you, Jane.

1015
00:45:53,129 --> 00:45:54,963
I'm not saying it's about me.

1016
00:45:54,964 --> 00:45:57,665
Christ, if anything,
it's all about you.

1017
00:45:57,666 --> 00:45:58,934
The only thing you can focus on

1018
00:45:58,935 --> 00:46:01,003
is a lunatic who
touches you a lot,

1019
00:46:01,004 --> 00:46:03,305
whose job it is to touch
people for a living.

1020
00:46:03,306 --> 00:46:04,606
But this is what you do.

1021
00:46:04,607 --> 00:46:07,409
Turn everything around
into this self-pity party.

1022
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:09,877
It can be really scary
to try new things.

1023
00:46:09,878 --> 00:46:11,713
When's the last time
you ever took a risk?

1024
00:46:11,714 --> 00:46:13,448
I'm moving to fucking London.

1025
00:46:13,449 --> 00:46:15,717
Yeah. You're moving back
to where you're from

1026
00:46:15,718 --> 00:46:16,818
with your boyfriend,

1027
00:46:16,819 --> 00:46:18,820
and on a fucking
expense account.

1028
00:46:18,821 --> 00:46:21,056
That's not taking a
risk. That's a whim.

1029
00:46:21,057 --> 00:46:23,558
It's an opportunity
to advance my career.

1030
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:25,928
Do you ever think about actually
doing something for a living?

1031
00:46:25,929 --> 00:46:27,062
You know, it's hard
to be a painter

1032
00:46:27,063 --> 00:46:28,196
if you stop fucking painting.

1033
00:46:28,197 --> 00:46:29,998
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

1034
00:46:29,999 --> 00:46:31,733
You know what?

1035
00:46:31,734 --> 00:46:33,735
I wouldn't fuck you. If you
were the last person on Earth,

1036
00:46:33,736 --> 00:46:34,869
I wouldn't fuck you.

1037
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:36,671
I feel sorry for you.

1038
00:46:36,672 --> 00:46:38,173
Don't. You don't need to.

1039
00:46:38,174 --> 00:46:40,442
You obviously don't
know anything about me.

1040
00:46:40,443 --> 00:46:42,979
Well, it's not
because I didn't try.

1041
00:46:43,979 --> 00:46:45,381
Have a good trip.

1042
00:46:48,984 --> 00:46:51,286
- Just call her.
- Oh, God.

1043
00:46:51,287 --> 00:46:53,956
When do you think the
last time I wore this was?

1044
00:46:53,957 --> 00:46:55,657
When you filmed <i>The Wiz?</i>

1045
00:46:55,658 --> 00:46:57,092
I don't feel joy.

1046
00:46:57,093 --> 00:46:59,561
How could you? It's very ugly.

1047
00:46:59,562 --> 00:47:00,795
This is hers.

1048
00:47:00,796 --> 00:47:02,364
- Whose?
- Hers.

1049
00:47:02,365 --> 00:47:03,865
Her name is Lucy.

1050
00:47:03,866 --> 00:47:05,901
She's your best friend.

1051
00:47:05,902 --> 00:47:07,402
What, we can't say
her name anymore?

1052
00:47:07,403 --> 00:47:08,703
She probably
doesn't even know...

1053
00:47:08,704 --> 00:47:11,307
She has, like, 4,000 of these.

1054
00:47:28,355 --> 00:47:30,058
<i>So, why don't you
just call her?</i>

1055
00:47:30,059 --> 00:47:32,594
Tell her you have it. Make up.

1056
00:47:32,595 --> 00:47:33,828
Maybe you won't be sad.

1057
00:47:33,829 --> 00:47:35,858
I'm not calling
her. I'm not sad.

1058
00:47:35,859 --> 00:47:38,266
I'm done. She's
never happy for me.

1059
00:47:38,267 --> 00:47:39,834
So, what, you're just
gonna go to London

1060
00:47:39,835 --> 00:47:41,569
and never talk to
your best friend?

1061
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:42,971
Probably.

1062
00:47:45,108 --> 00:47:47,175
Oh, I hate this stupid sweater!

1063
00:47:47,176 --> 00:47:50,045
Okay. All right, listen, this
is your favorite sweater.

1064
00:47:50,046 --> 00:47:53,148
Now I think we're just
misplacing our feelings.

1065
00:47:53,149 --> 00:47:55,217
I just wanted her
to move forward.

1066
00:47:55,218 --> 00:47:57,986
I know. But it's
not up to you.

1067
00:47:57,987 --> 00:47:59,454
Well, it should be.

1068
00:47:59,455 --> 00:48:01,657
You were saying she
called you bossy, right?

1069
00:48:02,858 --> 00:48:04,359
Aw, come here.

1070
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:07,496
I know. I know, I know, I
know, I know. Come here.

1071
00:48:08,596 --> 00:48:10,893
I'm sorry, baby.

1072
00:48:10,894 --> 00:48:12,968
Maybe we should go earlier.

1073
00:48:12,969 --> 00:48:15,437
Everything is gonna be okay.

1074
00:48:15,438 --> 00:48:17,640
It's just a stressful
time right now.

1075
00:48:22,011 --> 00:48:23,612
Are we waiting on your friend?

1076
00:48:24,378 --> 00:48:25,780
Mmm-mmm. No, it's just me.

1077
00:48:25,781 --> 00:48:27,815
Oh. What can I get you?

1078
00:48:27,816 --> 00:48:32,354
Um, I will have a veggie burger.

1079
00:48:32,355 --> 00:48:33,956
Mmm-hmm. That it?

1080
00:48:33,957 --> 00:48:36,824
Um, and an iced coffee, please.

1081
00:48:36,825 --> 00:48:38,093
Mmm. Cream?

1082
00:48:38,094 --> 00:48:40,595
Yes, please. Oh,
no, actually...

1083
00:48:40,596 --> 00:48:42,198
Just... Just black.

1084
00:49:13,761 --> 00:49:15,463
Ta-da!

1085
00:49:15,464 --> 00:49:16,598
Try-on party!

1086
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:20,903
- Oh, wow. Time to try me on.
- Ooh.

1087
00:49:20,904 --> 00:49:22,505
Or whatever.

1088
00:49:24,605 --> 00:49:26,108
- Wow.
- Here.

1089
00:49:26,109 --> 00:49:30,012
Put this one on. I'm
gonna go grab wine.

1090
00:49:30,013 --> 00:49:31,779
Oh, my God.

1091
00:49:38,019 --> 00:49:40,755
I feel like we need music.

1092
00:49:42,658 --> 00:49:44,727
Ooh, and atmosphere.

1093
00:49:47,595 --> 00:49:48,764
Um...

1094
00:49:49,864 --> 00:49:50,933
Much better.

1095
00:49:50,934 --> 00:49:52,535
There we go.

1096
00:49:53,801 --> 00:49:55,537
Look at your cute little body.

1097
00:49:55,538 --> 00:49:57,906
Oh, my God.

1098
00:49:57,907 --> 00:50:00,275
Wait. Okay.

1099
00:50:00,276 --> 00:50:02,077
I'm gonna help you.

1100
00:50:02,078 --> 00:50:03,678
Um...

1101
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:04,947
Is that your... Did you...

1102
00:50:04,948 --> 00:50:06,548
Why did you put
it over your head?

1103
00:50:06,549 --> 00:50:08,116
- I don't know.
- You could've just, like,

1104
00:50:08,117 --> 00:50:09,751
stepped into it here. Ooh.

1105
00:50:09,752 --> 00:50:12,087
It's gonna look so good
though, once it's on.

1106
00:50:12,088 --> 00:50:14,957
Oh, sorry!

1107
00:50:14,958 --> 00:50:16,524
Oh, there's a zipper.

1108
00:50:18,995 --> 00:50:21,263
That's so funny!

1109
00:50:21,264 --> 00:50:23,932
- That's so funny.
- Here we go.

1110
00:50:23,933 --> 00:50:27,070
Oh, my God. Yes, babe!

1111
00:50:27,864 --> 00:50:30,405
- Wow.
- You look so hot.

1112
00:50:30,406 --> 00:50:32,540
- What?
- I don't use that word like that.

1113
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:35,243
Luce, you have no
idea how hot you are.

1114
00:50:35,244 --> 00:50:38,080
Like, seriously. Turn
around. Look at your ass.

1115
00:50:38,081 --> 00:50:39,214
You have to keep that.

1116
00:50:39,215 --> 00:50:41,683
I'm a genius. I know.

1117
00:50:41,684 --> 00:50:43,718
Where do you even wear
something like this?

1118
00:50:43,719 --> 00:50:45,120
Like the clurb.

1119
00:50:45,121 --> 00:50:46,621
Where? Is that a restaurant?

1120
00:50:46,622 --> 00:50:49,124
The clurb. It's, like, a
funny word for the club.

1121
00:50:49,125 --> 00:50:51,159
- Oh, the club? That's right.
- Yes!

1122
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,928
- I don't...
- You're keeping that.

1123
00:50:52,929 --> 00:50:54,362
This one's next.

1124
00:50:54,363 --> 00:50:56,231
Let's take a break.
Let's take a pot break.

1125
00:50:56,232 --> 00:50:58,501
- Okay.
- For the anxiety.

1126
00:50:59,066 --> 00:51:00,903
You're right.

1127
00:51:00,904 --> 00:51:03,067
You know, colors
look good on you.

1128
00:51:07,241 --> 00:51:09,245
Gray's a color.

1129
00:51:10,944 --> 00:51:13,781
I can't stop thinking
about your paintings.

1130
00:51:13,782 --> 00:51:15,250
Please.

1131
00:51:15,251 --> 00:51:18,320
No, seriously. Did you, like,

1132
00:51:18,321 --> 00:51:21,590
go to fancy art
school or something?

1133
00:51:24,721 --> 00:51:26,061
No.

1134
00:51:26,062 --> 00:51:27,496
Why not?

1135
00:51:28,764 --> 00:51:30,299
I don't know.

1136
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:35,138
Well, why don't
you be a painter?

1137
00:51:38,707 --> 00:51:39,775
I don't know.

1138
00:51:42,709 --> 00:51:45,448
Why don't you
really try fashion?

1139
00:51:47,215 --> 00:51:49,051
'Cause it's hard.

1140
00:51:49,052 --> 00:51:51,353
And I'm lazy.

1141
00:51:51,354 --> 00:51:53,655
And it's just like a hobby.

1142
00:51:53,656 --> 00:51:54,856
But it's a tragedy

1143
00:51:54,857 --> 00:51:57,692
because I would've been,
like, a major success.

1144
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:03,165
But you're different.

1145
00:52:15,543 --> 00:52:19,682
I feel like there's
something going on here.

1146
00:52:23,646 --> 00:52:24,720
Yeah?

1147
00:52:26,253 --> 00:52:27,523
So...

1148
00:52:31,292 --> 00:52:32,561
Yeah.

1149
00:53:46,968 --> 00:53:48,436
What are you doing?

1150
00:53:48,437 --> 00:53:50,006
I'm gonna go pee.

1151
00:54:33,716 --> 00:54:37,520
I should, um... I
should probably go.

1152
00:54:41,389 --> 00:54:42,457
Really?

1153
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,793
Yeah, I just have

1154
00:54:45,794 --> 00:54:48,730
a lot of errands
to run and stuff,

1155
00:54:48,731 --> 00:54:52,400
but thanks for having me over.

1156
00:54:52,401 --> 00:54:53,869
That was really fun.

1157
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:59,474
Don't you want to stay
a little while longer?

1158
00:54:59,475 --> 00:55:01,709
Just a little.

1159
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:03,879
Yeah, I do. I...

1160
00:55:04,478 --> 00:55:05,848
I gotta go.

1161
00:55:09,117 --> 00:55:10,653
Well, thanks for...

1162
00:55:13,288 --> 00:55:14,991
everything.

1163
00:55:22,563 --> 00:55:24,433
Go back to bed.

1164
00:55:25,099 --> 00:55:26,369
Boop.

1165
00:55:43,251 --> 00:55:44,419
I love that she thinks

1166
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,720
we were sisters in a past life.

1167
00:55:45,721 --> 00:55:47,622
I've always thought
that about us.

1168
00:55:47,623 --> 00:55:49,352
Bye, see you guys...

1169
00:55:49,353 --> 00:55:50,926
Bye!

1170
00:55:50,927 --> 00:55:53,395
- Fucking love that class!
- Me, too.

1171
00:56:00,734 --> 00:56:02,504
Are you sure? You
don't have to do this.

1172
00:56:02,505 --> 00:56:03,571
No, I'm positive.

1173
00:56:03,572 --> 00:56:04,839
I actually think it would be

1174
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,409
really helpful to
get there sooner.

1175
00:56:07,075 --> 00:56:08,276
Great.

1176
00:56:08,277 --> 00:56:10,412
And Kat's agreed
to go early also.

1177
00:56:10,413 --> 00:56:12,214
Even better!

1178
00:56:12,215 --> 00:56:14,449
Anyway, let me know if
you need anything, Jane.

1179
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:15,817
And in the meantime,
I'll make sure

1180
00:56:15,818 --> 00:56:17,585
everything is set up
for you across the lake.

1181
00:56:17,586 --> 00:56:19,254
Well, thank you again.

1182
00:56:19,255 --> 00:56:20,555
No, thank you, Jane.

1183
00:56:20,556 --> 00:56:21,856
You're saving me a
crapload of money.

1184
00:56:21,857 --> 00:56:24,460
Start packing. Yeah?

1185
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:32,868
Hey.

1186
00:56:32,869 --> 00:56:35,270
- Oh, hi.
- How are you feeling?

1187
00:56:35,271 --> 00:56:37,339
Good. You?

1188
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,474
Great. Except,
whose idea was it

1189
00:56:39,475 --> 00:56:41,576
to drink and smoke so much?

1190
00:56:41,577 --> 00:56:44,180
- Yours.
- Oh, yeah. Oops.

1191
00:56:46,114 --> 00:56:47,215
Wrong folder.

1192
00:56:47,216 --> 00:56:48,750
I'm still high.

1193
00:56:48,751 --> 00:56:50,185
What are you doing tonight?

1194
00:56:50,186 --> 00:56:51,286
I can't wait for
this day to be over.

1195
00:56:51,287 --> 00:56:52,415
Hmm?

1196
00:56:52,416 --> 00:56:54,190
Oh, nothing. I was, um...

1197
00:56:55,356 --> 00:56:56,524
I need a nap.

1198
00:56:58,094 --> 00:57:00,528
- Me, too.
- Yeah.

1199
00:57:00,529 --> 00:57:02,831
Um... Are things weird?

1200
00:57:04,966 --> 00:57:06,034
Between us?

1201
00:57:06,035 --> 00:57:07,635
Yeah.

1202
00:57:07,636 --> 00:57:10,005
No. Why would they be weird?

1203
00:57:10,006 --> 00:57:11,339
I had so much fun.

1204
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:13,436
Like, I always
wanted to try that

1205
00:57:13,437 --> 00:57:15,277
and we did.

1206
00:57:15,278 --> 00:57:17,546
Maybe we can do it again.

1207
00:57:19,247 --> 00:57:21,483
Sure. I mean, yeah. I...

1208
00:57:21,484 --> 00:57:23,351
I'm free tonight
if you want to...

1209
00:57:23,352 --> 00:57:24,552
I mean, I know it's last minute.

1210
00:57:24,553 --> 00:57:27,489
Well, I can't tonight, but soon.

1211
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:29,092
- Cool.
- Cool.

1212
00:57:52,914 --> 00:57:58,914

1216
00:58:13,736 --> 00:58:16,004
Aw! Thank you, my babe.

1217
00:58:16,005 --> 00:58:17,839
You're welcome. I
used to work at IHOP,

1218
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,807
so I know the recipe.

1219
00:58:19,808 --> 00:58:21,709
You can share some
of that if you want.

1220
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:22,978
- No, I can't.
- Okay.

1221
00:58:22,979 --> 00:58:24,546
- It's your birthday.
- Good to know.

1222
00:58:24,547 --> 00:58:25,613
What was I thinking?
What was I thinking?

1223
00:58:25,614 --> 00:58:28,217
Hmm. What if she doesn't call?

1224
00:58:29,283 --> 00:58:30,552
She will!

1225
00:58:30,553 --> 00:58:32,054
But what if she doesn't?

1226
00:58:32,055 --> 00:58:34,389
Baby, she will.
Come here. Look.

1227
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:36,519
You know what?

1228
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,461
If she doesn't call,
you always got me.

1229
00:58:39,462 --> 00:58:40,828
It's not the same.

1230
00:58:40,829 --> 00:58:43,165
- None taken.
- I didn't say, "No offense."

1231
00:58:43,166 --> 00:58:44,666
Yet you should have.

1232
00:58:44,667 --> 00:58:46,001
You know, we've never not spoken

1233
00:58:46,002 --> 00:58:48,036
on our birthdays for
our entire friendship.

1234
00:58:48,037 --> 00:58:50,072
I don't even think
we've spent one apart.

1235
00:58:50,073 --> 00:58:51,273
Baby...

1236
00:58:51,274 --> 00:58:52,908
she is going to call you.

1237
00:58:52,909 --> 00:58:55,577
Well, what if she's
sad and she needs me?

1238
00:58:55,578 --> 00:58:59,881
Then you both are gonna
talk about all of that

1239
00:58:59,882 --> 00:59:03,885
when she calls. Okay?

1240
00:59:03,886 --> 00:59:06,121
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay. Right.

1241
00:59:06,122 --> 00:59:07,355
Yeah.

1242
00:59:07,356 --> 00:59:08,723
- That's for me? Thank you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1243
00:59:08,724 --> 00:59:10,826
- Mmm! Mmm!
- You're a monster.

1244
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:15,664
What's up?

1245
00:59:16,498 --> 00:59:17,700
Nothing.

1246
00:59:18,566 --> 00:59:20,002
It's Jane's birthday today

1247
00:59:20,003 --> 00:59:22,470
and, I don't know, we're
still in a fight, so...

1248
00:59:22,471 --> 00:59:24,872
- Aw, that sucks.
- Yeah.

1249
00:59:24,873 --> 00:59:26,508
What are you up to tonight?

1250
00:59:26,509 --> 00:59:29,277
Mmm, I may have
dinner with a friend.

1251
00:59:29,278 --> 00:59:32,747
My dumb ex texted me
saying he was in town,

1252
00:59:32,748 --> 00:59:35,017
so he might stop by here.

1253
00:59:35,018 --> 00:59:35,884
Cool.

1254
00:59:35,885 --> 00:59:37,752
Where is this stuff?

1255
00:59:37,753 --> 00:59:39,721
Um, bottom drawer.

1256
00:59:42,891 --> 00:59:45,794
Thank you. You the best.

1257
00:59:56,672 --> 00:59:58,106
Please don't pick up.

1258
00:59:58,107 --> 00:59:59,787
Please don't pick up.
Please don't pick up.

1259
01:00:00,975 --> 01:00:02,344
<i>Hey, it's Jane.</i>

1260
01:00:02,345 --> 01:00:04,313
<i>Leave a message. Thank you.</i>

1261
01:00:05,146 --> 01:00:06,848
Hi, um...

1262
01:00:06,849 --> 01:00:09,784
This is me. Uh, it's Lucy.

1263
01:00:09,785 --> 01:00:13,388
Um... I'm just calling to say,

1264
01:00:13,389 --> 01:00:16,992
uh, happy birthday to you,

1265
01:00:16,993 --> 01:00:21,397
and, um, many, many great days.

1266
01:00:22,329 --> 01:00:23,831
Uh...

1267
01:00:23,832 --> 01:00:25,600
I hope you're doing good.

1268
01:00:25,601 --> 01:00:27,669
And I will see you soon.

1269
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:29,871
I mean, talk to you soon.

1270
01:00:29,872 --> 01:00:31,706
Happy birthday.

1271
01:00:33,376 --> 01:00:34,609
You look great.

1272
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:36,244
- Okay. Look at you.
- I can't believe

1273
01:00:36,245 --> 01:00:38,046
- how long it's been.
- You look so good.

1274
01:00:39,582 --> 01:00:41,350
- You're hilarious.
- Yeah?

1275
01:00:43,083 --> 01:00:47,155
<i>I'm just calling to say
happy birthday to you,</i>

1276
01:00:47,156 --> 01:00:52,027
<i>and, um, many, many great days.</i>

1277
01:00:52,028 --> 01:00:54,963
<i>Uh, I hope you're doing good.</i>

1278
01:00:54,964 --> 01:00:58,733
<i>And I will see you soon.
I mean, talk to you soon.</i>

1279
01:00:58,734 --> 01:01:00,103
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

1280
01:01:02,669 --> 01:01:05,640
<i>Hi, um, this is me.</i>

1281
01:01:05,641 --> 01:01:07,142
<i>Uh, it's Lucy...</i>

1282
01:01:07,143 --> 01:01:08,576
Jane?

1283
01:01:08,577 --> 01:01:11,046
Hey, when you have a second,
can I see you in my office?

1284
01:01:11,047 --> 01:01:13,316
- Sure. I'll be right there.
- Okay, thanks.

1285
01:01:15,516 --> 01:01:17,185
You guys, she
totally fell for it.

1286
01:01:17,186 --> 01:01:19,387
She's coming. She fell
for it. Here she comes.

1287
01:01:19,388 --> 01:01:22,357
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

1288
01:01:22,358 --> 01:01:25,427
Happy birthday! Make a
wish for London Town.

1289
01:01:25,428 --> 01:01:28,196
I told them no cake, so
I'm not tempted to eat any.

1290
01:01:28,197 --> 01:01:29,597
But I love cake.

1291
01:01:29,598 --> 01:01:30,898
Sorry. I don't want it.

1292
01:01:30,899 --> 01:01:32,234
Can you turn to your left?

1293
01:01:32,235 --> 01:01:34,136
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

1294
01:01:34,137 --> 01:01:36,004
I have a little
something for you.

1295
01:01:36,005 --> 01:01:37,539
A credit

1296
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:39,908
to the Tate Modern gift shop.

1297
01:01:39,909 --> 01:01:42,177
It's been in my wallet
for about five years.

1298
01:01:42,178 --> 01:01:44,112
Thank you so much, Mr. Davis.

1299
01:01:44,113 --> 01:01:46,081
You deserve it.
Have a safe trip.

1300
01:01:46,082 --> 01:01:48,150
Oh, I don't leave for
another three weeks.

1301
01:01:48,151 --> 01:01:50,286
- I'm gonna say goodbye now.
- Okay.

1302
01:01:51,653 --> 01:01:53,555
- Open it.
- Oh.

1303
01:01:53,556 --> 01:01:55,423
You didn't have to
get me anything.

1304
01:01:59,593 --> 01:02:00,862
Hammock Sanctuary?

1305
01:02:00,863 --> 01:02:02,864
- Have you been?
- No.

1306
01:02:02,865 --> 01:02:04,799
Oh, my God, you're
gonna love it.

1307
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,868
It's a mind-body
new vibes retreat.

1308
01:02:06,869 --> 01:02:08,336
And everything's in a hammock.

1309
01:02:08,337 --> 01:02:09,537
You eat in a hammock,
you sleep in a hammock,

1310
01:02:09,538 --> 01:02:10,605
you live in a hammock.

1311
01:02:10,606 --> 01:02:11,734
You could have that privilege.

1312
01:02:11,735 --> 01:02:13,475
Oh, my! Uh...

1313
01:02:13,476 --> 01:02:15,010
Wh... where is it?

1314
01:02:15,011 --> 01:02:17,612
In the middle of the woods,
totally off the grid.

1315
01:02:17,613 --> 01:02:19,214
And you're not even supposed
to bring your phone,

1316
01:02:19,215 --> 01:02:20,815
but I will for Insta, obviously,

1317
01:02:20,816 --> 01:02:22,217
'cause I'm not a
fucking psychopath.

1318
01:02:22,218 --> 01:02:25,053
Smile. Say, "Hammock girls."

1319
01:02:25,054 --> 01:02:26,989
Hammock gir... I
need to hear it.

1320
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:29,191
Hammock girls.

1321
01:02:29,192 --> 01:02:30,959
All right, so, is this a cult?

1322
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,360
'Cause it sounds like a cult.

1323
01:02:32,361 --> 01:02:34,862
It was a gift. What
was I supposed to say?

1324
01:02:34,863 --> 01:02:37,299
You say, "No, thank you,
white lady. I'm good."

1325
01:02:43,365 --> 01:02:44,540
Lucy's not here.

1326
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:47,475
I know. I'm just...

1327
01:02:47,476 --> 01:02:49,011
- looking at...
- What?

1328
01:02:49,012 --> 01:02:51,280
- Something.
- Okay.

1329
01:02:54,115 --> 01:02:56,252
I think it's nice
that she called.

1330
01:02:58,086 --> 01:03:00,156
Maybe you should call her back.

1331
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:04,026
I think you should.

1332
01:03:04,027 --> 01:03:06,861
She doesn't even know
that I'm leaving earlier.

1333
01:03:06,862 --> 01:03:09,331
You should tell her.

1334
01:03:09,332 --> 01:03:11,867
- Did you already tell her?
- Me?

1335
01:03:12,433 --> 01:03:14,536
No! Nah. Mmm-mmm.

1336
01:03:14,537 --> 01:03:15,904
Mmm-mmm.

1337
01:03:15,905 --> 01:03:19,041
You're being weird. Why
are you being weird?

1338
01:03:19,042 --> 01:03:21,609
Why is everyone being
so fucking weird?

1339
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:23,545
What?

1340
01:03:23,546 --> 01:03:25,680
I don't know. I...

1341
01:03:25,681 --> 01:03:28,283
don't think I could go.

1342
01:03:28,284 --> 01:03:31,186
That's fine. You
can come later.

1343
01:03:31,187 --> 01:03:32,921
Yeah.

1344
01:03:32,922 --> 01:03:36,224
- Fine. That's fine.
- What?

1345
01:03:36,225 --> 01:03:38,426
I don't think I could go.

1346
01:03:38,427 --> 01:03:41,965
I just said you
can come whenever.

1347
01:03:44,899 --> 01:03:46,269
I mean "go."

1348
01:03:47,101 --> 01:03:49,572
Like... at all.

1349
01:03:51,305 --> 01:03:53,175
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- What are you talking about?

1350
01:03:53,176 --> 01:03:54,442
I don't want to talk
about this right now.

1351
01:03:54,443 --> 01:03:55,978
Well, you're already
talking about it,

1352
01:03:55,979 --> 01:03:59,047
so... can you please continue?

1353
01:03:59,048 --> 01:04:02,085
My life... is here.

1354
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:06,922
- I'm part of your life.
- Yes, yes. Of course.

1355
01:04:06,923 --> 01:04:10,192
I just mean... my job.

1356
01:04:10,193 --> 01:04:14,163
And my family and my friends.

1357
01:04:18,932 --> 01:04:21,470
You didn't even ask
me if I wanted to go.

1358
01:04:22,904 --> 01:04:25,440
You just assumed I would.

1359
01:04:25,441 --> 01:04:29,144
Ah, fuck it. I've just been
thinking about this so much.

1360
01:04:29,145 --> 01:04:31,146
And I love you, and I
want to be with you.

1361
01:04:31,147 --> 01:04:33,515
I really do, but...

1362
01:04:33,516 --> 01:04:36,484
I don't think I
could do it there.

1363
01:04:36,485 --> 01:04:39,988
Maybe, you know,
after a year I'll go.

1364
01:04:39,989 --> 01:04:42,191
Or maybe you'll come back,

1365
01:04:42,858 --> 01:04:44,227
make it work.

1366
01:04:56,104 --> 01:04:58,007
Have a great celebration.

1367
01:06:15,645 --> 01:06:17,185
Hey.

1368
01:06:17,186 --> 01:06:19,421
- Hi.
- You got a sec?

1369
01:06:19,422 --> 01:06:22,624
Yeah, I sure do.
I'm here till 5:00.

1370
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:24,426
Um...

1371
01:06:24,427 --> 01:06:28,330
I just wanted to talk to
you to let you know...

1372
01:06:28,331 --> 01:06:31,799
that I'm gonna be going
to Portland in a month.

1373
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:35,738
Yeah, and I'll probably be
there for a little while.

1374
01:06:37,071 --> 01:06:38,974
Great.

1375
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:40,542
- For the ex?
- Yeah.

1376
01:06:40,543 --> 01:06:44,346
I don't know if we're,
like... getting back together

1377
01:06:44,347 --> 01:06:47,010
or if this is the worst
idea in the world...

1378
01:06:48,684 --> 01:06:51,119
But I just... I wanted
to tell you because...

1379
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:53,321
It's okay. Yeah.

1380
01:06:53,322 --> 01:06:54,657
Well, 'cause you...

1381
01:06:56,919 --> 01:06:58,794
'Cause you make the schedule.

1382
01:06:59,522 --> 01:07:01,096
Right.

1383
01:07:01,097 --> 01:07:03,732
Yeah. Mmm-hmm. Thank you.

1384
01:07:04,532 --> 01:07:07,269
- Are we okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

1385
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:09,704
- Yeah, we're okay.
- Okay.

1386
01:07:09,705 --> 01:07:11,035
Cool.

1387
01:07:13,107 --> 01:07:14,176
Love ya.

1388
01:08:09,897 --> 01:08:11,133
Are you serious?

1389
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:16,539
Wow.

1390
01:08:17,272 --> 01:08:19,103
I wasn't expecting that.

1391
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:21,577
Are you sure?

1392
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:26,882
And you're just
realizing this recently?

1393
01:08:28,116 --> 01:08:31,220
I think I've known for a while.

1394
01:08:32,882 --> 01:08:34,822
Have you been with girls?

1395
01:08:34,823 --> 01:08:36,892
Mmm-hmm. One.

1396
01:08:37,892 --> 01:08:39,262
Did you like it?

1397
01:08:41,962 --> 01:08:45,901
I think maybe I liked it a
little bit more than she did.

1398
01:08:45,902 --> 01:08:47,069
Mmm.

1399
01:08:47,070 --> 01:08:48,736
Do you want me to destroy her?

1400
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:52,208
I'm not really sure what to say.

1401
01:08:54,008 --> 01:08:56,211
You can say anything.

1402
01:08:56,212 --> 01:08:58,513
So, do you have a type?

1403
01:08:58,514 --> 01:09:01,116
No. I don't know.

1404
01:09:01,117 --> 01:09:04,252
I like brunettes with long hair

1405
01:09:04,253 --> 01:09:06,922
who are attracted to women.

1406
01:09:06,923 --> 01:09:08,623
It's funny,

1407
01:09:08,624 --> 01:09:10,292
I always felt like
you treated me

1408
01:09:10,293 --> 01:09:11,826
like your gay best friend.

1409
01:09:11,827 --> 01:09:13,895
But, uh, it turns
out you're mine.

1410
01:09:13,896 --> 01:09:15,763
Oh, I'm sorry.

1411
01:09:15,764 --> 01:09:17,160
I'm sorry that I...

1412
01:09:19,768 --> 01:09:21,304
couldn't tell you.

1413
01:09:22,470 --> 01:09:24,207
I'm sorry about the girl.

1414
01:09:25,874 --> 01:09:27,243
It's all good.

1415
01:09:30,144 --> 01:09:31,514
Good night, Ben.

1416
01:09:33,148 --> 01:09:34,816

1423
01:10:04,547 --> 01:10:06,648
I'm not cool with needles.

Welcome... to the
Hammock Sanctuary.

1453
01:11:42,645 --> 01:11:45,914
Like the bosoms of
our foremothers,

1454
01:11:45,915 --> 01:11:49,918
the hammock cradles us.

1455
01:11:49,919 --> 01:11:53,589
If the trees of the
forest are our legs...

1456
01:11:54,522 --> 01:11:57,725
the hammock is our vulva.

1457
01:11:57,726 --> 01:12:00,795
Let's close our eyes
and allow ourselves

1458
01:12:00,796 --> 01:12:05,034
to be enveloped by
our mesh cocoons.

1459
01:12:07,335 --> 01:12:10,333
We are all seeds
of the universe,

1460
01:12:10,334 --> 01:12:13,241
and soon we will begin to bloom.

1461
01:12:21,615 --> 01:12:23,347
Let's close our eyes.

1462
01:12:25,386 --> 01:12:26,755
Let's close them.

1463
01:12:28,255 --> 01:12:30,825
- And we'll close them.
- Okay.

1464
01:12:30,826 --> 01:12:32,627
- Okay, close your eyes.
- I will.

1465
01:12:32,628 --> 01:12:34,430
Well, you're not closing them.

1466
01:12:35,696 --> 01:12:38,400
As we open our throat chakra,

1467
01:12:38,401 --> 01:12:41,436
I encourage you all

1468
01:12:41,437 --> 01:12:44,406
to release your voice

1469
01:12:44,407 --> 01:12:47,542
as ferociously as
the Vishuddha...

1470
01:12:47,543 --> 01:12:50,145
will allow.

1471
01:12:54,215 --> 01:12:55,850
That was nice, Kat.

1472
01:12:58,087 --> 01:12:59,454
Would it help if I rocked you?

1473
01:12:59,455 --> 01:13:00,923
No, I'm okay, thank you.

1474
01:13:00,924 --> 01:13:03,091
- Let me rock you.
- I'm good.

1475
01:13:03,092 --> 01:13:04,993
It'd be best if I rocked you.

1476
01:13:07,096 --> 01:13:09,464
You need to let it
out. It's in here.

1477
01:13:09,465 --> 01:13:11,466
It's right in there.

1478
01:13:11,467 --> 01:13:13,069
It needs to come out.

1479
01:13:18,741 --> 01:13:21,577
Okay, well... Jesus Christ.

1480
01:14:18,967 --> 01:14:20,035
Hi.

1481
01:14:29,676 --> 01:14:30,879
What are you gonna get?

1482
01:14:31,746 --> 01:14:33,781
Um., maybe an omelet.

1483
01:14:33,782 --> 01:14:35,985
- That sounds good.
- Mmm.

1484
01:14:37,318 --> 01:14:38,720
You girls ready?

1485
01:14:38,721 --> 01:14:41,856
Yeah. May I have an omelet
with tomato and spinach?

1486
01:14:41,857 --> 01:14:44,259
- Mmm-hmm.
- Please. And an iced coffee.

1487
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:45,928
Thank you.

1488
01:14:45,929 --> 01:14:48,864
I'll do the Chinese chicken
salad and a green tea. Thanks.

1489
01:14:49,864 --> 01:14:51,333
No more veggie burgers?

1490
01:14:51,334 --> 01:14:53,969
Just switching it up.

1491
01:14:53,970 --> 01:14:56,772
Wild!

1492
01:15:00,308 --> 01:15:01,743
So, when do you leave?

1493
01:15:01,744 --> 01:15:03,711
I'm going early, actually.

1494
01:15:03,712 --> 01:15:05,480
I leave next week.

1495
01:15:05,481 --> 01:15:07,249
Next... Wow, that's...

1496
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:10,218
What made you want to do that?

1497
01:15:10,219 --> 01:15:12,320
Danny's not going anymore.

1498
01:15:12,321 --> 01:15:14,022
You and I were in a fight.

1499
01:15:14,023 --> 01:15:17,059
It's easier to leave than deal
with those things, I suppose.

1500
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:18,727
Danny's not going?

1501
01:15:19,695 --> 01:15:21,463
Why? What happened?

1502
01:15:21,464 --> 01:15:24,332
He said he likes his life here.

1503
01:15:24,333 --> 01:15:26,769
Which is fine.

1504
01:15:28,603 --> 01:15:31,473
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

1505
01:15:31,474 --> 01:15:32,909
It's fine.

1506
01:15:34,208 --> 01:15:35,843
It's fine.

1507
01:15:35,844 --> 01:15:37,813
What have you been up to?

1508
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,415
Well, I... I quit the spa.

1509
01:15:40,416 --> 01:15:44,119
Holy shit! That's amazing,
Lucy. Good for you.

1510
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:46,621
Thanks. I started
painting again.

1511
01:15:46,622 --> 01:15:48,123
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

1512
01:15:48,124 --> 01:15:49,292
That's great!

1513
01:15:51,158 --> 01:15:53,761
And I've been on
some girl dates.

1514
01:15:53,762 --> 01:15:56,498
What? You don't
start with that?

1515
01:15:56,499 --> 01:15:58,633
- I'm just taking it slow.
- Wow!

1516
01:15:58,634 --> 01:16:00,202
Okay, you're playing it so cool.

1517
01:16:00,203 --> 01:16:02,204
What happened with BB Brit-Brit?

1518
01:16:02,205 --> 01:16:04,639
Oh, BB Brit-Brit, yes.

1519
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,341
Um, she's straight.

1520
01:16:06,342 --> 01:16:08,644
Ah, I doubt that very much.

1521
01:16:10,244 --> 01:16:11,646
Yeah.

1522
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:12,981
We had a try-on party.

1523
01:16:12,982 --> 01:16:15,578
- That is not a thing.
- It is a thing.

1524
01:16:15,579 --> 01:16:17,652
Okay, did you make out?

1525
01:16:17,653 --> 01:16:19,354
Did you make out?

1526
01:16:19,355 --> 01:16:22,490
You may ask me some questions
that I will say yes or no to.

1527
01:16:22,491 --> 01:16:24,292
Okay. Boobs in mouth?

1528
01:16:24,293 --> 01:16:25,860
Wow. Um, yes.

1529
01:16:25,861 --> 01:16:27,095
Did you go down on her?

1530
01:16:27,096 --> 01:16:29,731
- No.
- Did she go down on you?

1531
01:16:29,732 --> 01:16:32,134
- Yes.
- Um, did you finger-bang her?

1532
01:16:32,135 --> 01:16:34,336
- Oh, my God.
- Butt stuff? Any butt stuff?

1533
01:16:34,337 --> 01:16:36,871
What? Butt stuff?
Jane, that is hardcore.

1534
01:16:36,872 --> 01:16:38,741
You definitely did butt stuff.

1535
01:16:39,741 --> 01:16:41,243
- No.
- Yeah!

1536
01:16:41,244 --> 01:16:43,011
Oh, my God. We don't
need to talk about it.

1537
01:16:43,012 --> 01:16:46,282
I just can't believe
I missed all of this.

1538
01:16:49,885 --> 01:16:51,886
I'm... I'm...

1539
01:16:51,887 --> 01:16:54,357
I'm really sorry, Lucy.

1540
01:16:57,192 --> 01:17:00,295
- You don't have to apologize.
- Yes, I do.

1541
01:17:00,296 --> 01:17:01,964
And I really am.

1542
01:17:01,965 --> 01:17:05,333
I was just... I
don't know, I was...

1543
01:17:05,334 --> 01:17:06,768
I was frustrated.

1544
01:17:06,769 --> 01:17:09,371
You were so stuck, I
was just trying to help.

1545
01:17:09,372 --> 01:17:10,973
Yeah, I know.

1546
01:17:10,974 --> 01:17:12,140
I don't know why
I've always been

1547
01:17:12,141 --> 01:17:13,976
so set on solving your problems.

1548
01:17:13,977 --> 01:17:16,178
Hmm. Hmm.

1549
01:17:16,179 --> 01:17:18,346
May I venture a guess?

1550
01:17:18,347 --> 01:17:19,642
Have at it.

1551
01:17:19,643 --> 01:17:22,450
I think that perhaps,
I don't know,

1552
01:17:22,451 --> 01:17:26,554
maybe it's easier to focus
on someone else's problems

1553
01:17:26,555 --> 01:17:28,790
than face your own,

1554
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:32,527
and perhaps there's
some control issues

1555
01:17:32,528 --> 01:17:35,658
from being forced to move
here when you were a teenager.

1556
01:17:35,659 --> 01:17:37,632
No, that's not it.

1557
01:17:37,633 --> 01:17:39,334
Oh, yeah, that's not it?

1558
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:43,371
I took you for granted.

1559
01:17:43,372 --> 01:17:45,873
I don't know why it took
swinging in a dirty hammock

1560
01:17:45,874 --> 01:17:48,776
for me to realize that I
really fucking need you.

1561
01:17:48,777 --> 01:17:50,278
Oh, I hate this!

1562
01:17:50,279 --> 01:17:51,947
I feel like I've skipped a
whole season of your life.

1563
01:17:51,948 --> 01:17:53,315
What am I gonna miss

1564
01:17:53,316 --> 01:17:54,582
when I'm on the other
side of the world?

1565
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:56,952
Probably butt stuff.

1566
01:17:56,953 --> 01:17:59,721
{\an8}Okay, can we figure
out when you'll visit?

1567
01:17:59,722 --> 01:18:01,556
Yeah, I'll come when
you get settled.

1568
01:18:01,557 --> 01:18:03,391
In two weeks?

1569
01:18:03,392 --> 01:18:05,460
Jane, you're gonna be okay.

1570
01:18:05,461 --> 01:18:06,828
You're gonna love being there.

1571
01:18:06,829 --> 01:18:08,396
It's your home.

1572
01:18:08,397 --> 01:18:11,166
I mean, you speak the
language. That's good.

1573
01:18:11,167 --> 01:18:14,402
You make super-annoying
friends, like, really easily.

1574
01:18:14,403 --> 01:18:16,504
You're gonna find a new
me in, like, a week.

1575
01:18:16,505 --> 01:18:19,341
I will never find a new you.

1576
01:18:19,342 --> 01:18:21,410
I don't wanna miss
your first girlfriend.

1577
01:18:24,011 --> 01:18:25,547
Do you have a ride
to the airport?

1578
01:18:25,548 --> 01:18:26,681
Do you want me to take you?

1579
01:18:26,682 --> 01:18:28,450
No, you are a terrible driver.

1580
01:18:28,451 --> 01:18:32,520
I'm not. I feel that I'm actually
a really good driver. One car...

1581
01:18:32,521 --> 01:18:35,357
You have to see what's going
on behind you right now.

1582
01:18:37,226 --> 01:18:39,227
Oh, my God! Wow!

1583
01:18:39,228 --> 01:18:41,896
The whole thing? I've never
thought of doing that.

1584
01:18:41,897 --> 01:18:44,766
- But I will now.
- That is great.

1585
01:18:51,305 --> 01:18:53,108
Whoo! London Town!

1586
01:18:53,109 --> 01:18:56,478
- You sound like Kat.
- Wow.

1587
01:18:56,479 --> 01:19:00,515
That's actually the meanest
thing you've ever said to me.

1588
01:19:00,516 --> 01:19:02,684
And you've said some
really fucked-up shit.

1589
01:19:02,685 --> 01:19:04,748
Oh.

1590
01:19:06,248 --> 01:19:07,256
Yeah.

1591
01:19:09,657 --> 01:19:10,927
Okay.

1592
01:19:14,995 --> 01:19:17,900
- Cheer up, buttercup.
- Oh, please. No.

1593
01:19:20,168 --> 01:19:21,336
Oh.

1594
01:19:21,337 --> 01:19:22,804
Is it still broken?

1595
01:19:22,805 --> 01:19:25,073
I thought you got that fixed.

1596
01:19:25,074 --> 01:19:27,542
Yeah, well, you just have
to open it from the inside.

1597
01:19:27,543 --> 01:19:28,977
It's not broken.

1598
01:19:28,978 --> 01:19:31,246
That sounds really safe.

1599
01:19:31,247 --> 01:19:33,182
Okay!

1600
01:19:33,781 --> 01:19:35,317
Here we go.

1601
01:19:35,318 --> 01:19:37,520
- Oh!
- Oh, Jesus! Shall we swap?

1602
01:19:38,753 --> 01:19:40,123
That's it.

1603
01:19:43,126 --> 01:19:44,226
Okay.

1604
01:19:44,227 --> 01:19:47,362
- Whoo!
- Jesus!

1605
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,202
Why are you smiling?

1606
01:19:54,203 --> 01:19:58,406
Um... What? Because
I'm happy for you.

1607
01:19:58,407 --> 01:20:00,343
This is really exciting.

1608
01:20:04,806 --> 01:20:07,182
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm great.

1609
01:20:07,183 --> 01:20:09,417
I'm also... You know,
I'm happy for me, too.

1610
01:20:09,418 --> 01:20:11,786
Because I won't be here
to boss you around?

1611
01:20:11,787 --> 01:20:14,990
No, because I'm coming with you.

1612
01:20:14,991 --> 01:20:16,424
- What?
- I'm coming.

1613
01:20:16,425 --> 01:20:20,662
I'm gonna come on this
plane to London Town.

1614
01:20:20,663 --> 01:20:22,230
What are you talking about?

1615
01:20:22,231 --> 01:20:23,999
I know that you really like
to tell me what I need,

1616
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,169
but I know what you need also.

1617
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:30,305
And that is me, so I'm coming

1618
01:20:30,306 --> 01:20:33,375
for emotional support and
overall encouragement.

1619
01:20:33,376 --> 01:20:35,510
- Are you serious?
- Well, yes!

1620
01:20:35,511 --> 01:20:37,745
You had shaky
voice at the diner.

1621
01:20:37,746 --> 01:20:39,781
No, I didn't. It was the wind.

1622
01:20:39,782 --> 01:20:42,951
- You were trembling.
- How long are you gonna stay?

1623
01:20:42,952 --> 01:20:44,519
Well, I don't know.

1624
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:47,655
Maybe a fortnight. That
means two weeks in England.

1625
01:20:47,656 --> 01:20:49,791
- Okay?
- Yeah, I know what a fortnight is.

1626
01:20:49,792 --> 01:20:51,726
It's just to get you
settled, you know?

1627
01:20:51,727 --> 01:20:53,395
This is crazy!

1628
01:20:53,396 --> 01:20:55,830
And I brought you a muffin.

1629
01:20:55,831 --> 01:20:58,566
You can have half when we take
off and half over New York.

1630
01:20:59,863 --> 01:21:02,804
Oh, my God, oh, my
God, oh, my God!

1631
01:21:02,805 --> 01:21:04,106
We're going to London together.

1632
01:21:04,107 --> 01:21:05,673
I know. It's great. Hey, no.

1633
01:21:05,674 --> 01:21:09,777
I said half when we take
off and half over New York.

1634
01:21:09,778 --> 01:21:11,179
You're so bossy.

1635
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:13,081
Yeah, well, that's who
I am now. I'm in charge.

1636
01:21:13,082 --> 01:21:15,051
What are you gonna
do with your car?

1637
01:21:17,519 --> 01:21:19,221
Oh.

1638
01:21:19,222 --> 01:21:22,224
Um, I'm gonna, uh, park it.

1639
01:21:22,225 --> 01:21:23,725
What about your passport?

1640
01:21:23,726 --> 01:21:25,593
I have it in my bag.

1641
01:21:25,594 --> 01:21:28,330
- Has it expired?
- They expire?

1642
01:21:28,331 --> 01:21:29,764
Do you have luggage?

1643
01:21:29,765 --> 01:21:31,233
I have a carry-on.

1644
01:21:31,234 --> 01:21:32,667
You're gonna need a
warmer jacket than that.

1645
01:21:32,668 --> 01:21:35,304
No. Okay, that's
enough. No more talking.
