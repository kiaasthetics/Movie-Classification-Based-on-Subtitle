<i>They say,
if you wanna tell a story right,</i>

3
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,402
<i>you gotta start
at the beginning.</i>

4
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:42,108
<i>Too far? Fine.</i>

5
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:45,477
<i>This is me, Harleen Quinzel.</i>

6
00:00:45,544 --> 00:00:46,847
<i>When I was a kid,</i>

7
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,581
<i>my dad traded me
for a six-pack of beer.</i>

8
00:00:48,647 --> 00:00:50,083
<i>But however many times
he tried to ditch me...</i>

9
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,350
Daddy!

10
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:53,053
- <i>...I kept coming back.</i>
- Ah!

11
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,155
<i>Eventually,
he found me a new home.</i>

12
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,722
<i>The good sisters</i>

13
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:59,092
<i>of St. Bernadette's
taught me a lot.</i>

14
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:03,964
<i>But I was never
an establishment kinda gal.</i>

15
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,266
<i>All things considered,
I did good.</i>

16
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,600
<i>I even went to college.</i>

17
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:09,169
<i>Got my PhD.</i>

18
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,403
<i>Had my heart broken
once or twice.</i>

19
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,572
<i>Finding love,
it's not easy.</i>

20
00:01:13,639 --> 00:01:15,976
<i>So I threw myself
into my work,</i>

21
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:17,310
<i>became a psychiatrist.</i>

22
00:01:17,376 --> 00:01:19,511
<i>That's when I met him.</i>

23
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:22,381
<i>Mr. J. My Joker.</i>

24
00:01:22,448 --> 00:01:23,884
<i>Oh, I fell hard.</i>

25
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,485
<i>Like out of a plane
without a parachute,</i>

26
00:01:26,552 --> 00:01:27,653
<i>right in
your dumb fucking face</i>

27
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,989
<i>kinda hard.</i>

28
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:31,324
<i>I lost all sense
of who I was.</i>

29
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,094
<i>I only had eyes for Puddin'.</i>

30
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,728
<i>We all know the saying,</i>

31
00:01:35,794 --> 00:01:37,529
<i>"Behind every successful man</i>

32
00:01:37,596 --> 00:01:39,332
<i>there's a badass broad."</i>

33
00:01:39,398 --> 00:01:40,867
<i>Well, that was me.</i>

34
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,802
<i>I was the brains
behind some of</i>

35
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,603
- <i>Mr. J's greatest stunts.</i>
- Ha-ha!

36
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,206
<i>Not that
he let anyone know it.</i>

37
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,941
Puddin'?

38
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:50,709
<i>I guess all good things
have to come to an end.</i>

39
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,046
<i>So...</i>

40
00:01:55,514 --> 00:01:56,883
<i>...we broke up.</i>

41
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:01,154
<i>I handled it real mature.</i>

42
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:04,224
<i>But Mr. J was super
broke up about it.</i>

43
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,731
<i>I got an amazing new place
that was all mine.</i>

44
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,770
<i>It gave me the space
to really reflect</i>

45
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:19,738
<i>on the mistakes of my past.</i>

46
00:02:23,642 --> 00:02:26,612
<i>I had to find
a new identity.</i>

47
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,615
<i>A new me.</i>

48
00:02:32,651 --> 00:02:34,020
<i>It wasn't easy.</i>

49
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,755
<i>But after a while,
I even opened myself up</i>

50
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,426
<i>to the possibility
of new love.</i>

51
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:43,529
Hi.

52
00:02:43,595 --> 00:02:46,565
Hello, nice baby.

53
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,704
<i>Here's the thing
about new love...</i>

54
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,207
I take payment-in-kind.

55
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:57,643
<i>...you have to feed it.</i>

56
00:03:07,553 --> 00:03:09,722
<i>Soon enough,
I was back on my feet.</i>

57
00:03:09,788 --> 00:03:13,360
<i>Ready to move on,
to make new friends.</i>

58
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:16,463
<i>She means fucking business!</i>

59
00:03:16,528 --> 00:03:18,031
- <i>Oh, here we go!</i>
- Whip me!

60
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,631
<i>She has taken
a whip from the pivot,</i>

61
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:21,567
<i>catapulted to the high side!</i>

62
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:23,535
<i>Oh!</i>

63
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:33,213
Yeah! Come on!

64
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:37,583
<i>It was time for Gotham
to meet the new Harley Quinn,</i>

65
00:03:37,649 --> 00:03:39,986
<i>so I really
put myself out there.</i>

66
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,788
Ride that pole
like you ride your man!

67
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,930
God damn it.
Sit the fuck down.

68
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,265
What?

69
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:56,002
I said sit your skinny ass
down, you dumb slut.

70
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,736
Okay.

71
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,376
You broke my fucking legs!

72
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,978
Oh, boo-hoo.

73
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,649
What?

74
00:04:10,716 --> 00:04:14,287
It's not a party without a little
drama, am I right?

75
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,523
Come on! Turn it up!

76
00:04:16,588 --> 00:04:18,958
Shots on the house.

77
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:23,229
Call me dumb.
I have a PhD, motherfucker.

78
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,365
- Miss Quinn.
- Romy.

79
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,499
That was my driver.

80
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:28,134
Oh, whoops.

81
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,170
Well, I'm sure it was his fault.
Consider him fired.

82
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:31,304
Consider me grateful.

83
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,540
Especially since
I know you don't like me.

84
00:04:33,605 --> 00:04:36,608
I agitate his already delicate
sense of mental equilibrium.

85
00:04:36,675 --> 00:04:38,445
That and
his obsessive-compulsive need

86
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:39,846
to be
the center of attention.

87
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:42,549
Will your paramour
be joining us this evening?

88
00:04:42,614 --> 00:04:46,286
Not tonight, Romy.
Not tonight.

89
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:47,821
Well, enjoy yourself,
Miss Quinn.

90
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,889
And do give
the Joker my best.

91
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,623
<i>Okay, fine, so I hadn't</i>

92
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,758
<i>told people
about the breakup.</i>

93
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,626
<i>But you don't understand.</i>

94
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:56,196
Find me a new driver.

95
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:59,499
<i>Being Joker's girl
gave me immunity.</i>

96
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:03,336
<i>I could do whatever I wanted
to whoever I wanted,</i>

97
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:06,206
<i>and no one
ever dared to object.</i>

98
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:21,720
And don't let him
give you shit, okay?

99
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:24,090
You have to
stick up for yourself.

100
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,944
Oh, please.
I give it a few days

101
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,446
before they're back together.

102
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,881
<i>Even when I did
try and tell people,</i>

103
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,215
<i>they didn't believe me.</i>

104
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,817
Come on.
She told me they're really

105
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,152
broken up this time.

106
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,020
Sure they are, Shell.

107
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,922
That's why she's still wearing
that tacky "J" necklace.

108
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,959
She is going to be running
right back into his arms

109
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,528
the minute
he snaps his fingers.

110
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,695
If not him,
the next closest alpha male

111
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:04,831
- with a pulse.
- Mmm-hmm.

112
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:07,000
Some people
just aren't born

113
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,401
- to stand on their own.
- Oh, girl,

114
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:09,836
- let's drink. Come on.
- All right.

115
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,171
<i>I knew I needed to find</i>

116
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,839
<i>some way
to show the world</i>

117
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,842
<i>that I'd cut ties
with Mr. J for good.</i>

118
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,110
Harley!

119
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,615
<i>Some people have the Eiffel
Tower, or Olive Garden.</i>

120
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:23,816
<i>The Joker and I?</i>

121
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,285
<i>Our love bloomed in</i>

122
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:28,321
<i>a highly toxic
industrial processing plant.</i>

123
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:35,895
<i>And luckily for me,</i>

124
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:38,431
<i>I have all
my best ideas drunk.</i>

125
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:42,001
I have the best idea!

126
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:53,046
The fuck? Hey! Hey!
Come back here!

127
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,625
This is
where it all began, Puddin'.

128
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,596
You motherfucker!

129
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,524
<i>It was the closure
I needed.</i>

130
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:39,926
<i>A fresh start.</i>

131
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,061
<i>A chance to be
my own woman.</i>

132
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,775
<i>But I wasn't
the only dame in Gotham</i>

133
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,511
<i>looking for emancipation.</i>

134
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:02,548
<i>This is our story.</i>

135
00:08:04,783 --> 00:08:06,185
<i>And I'm telling it,</i>

136
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,820
<i>so I'll start
where I fucking want.</i>

137
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,224
<i>Meet the cop.</i>

138
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,959
I got 50
says it was turf war.

139
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,294
<i>Not him.</i>

140
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,828
Well, as always,
you're wrong, Munroe.

141
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,997
<i>Her. Renee Montoya.</i>

142
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,532
<i>Raised on '80s cop shows,</i>

143
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,501
<i>she's always saying
cheesy shit like...</i>

144
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,236
There was only one shooter.

145
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,104
Inside.

146
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,407
This guy shot out the glass.

147
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:28,508
Serrano.

148
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,376
Yo. Hey.

149
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:32,945
Have Ballistics
check for a bullet

150
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,747
in one of those parked cars.

151
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,116
<i>Ten years ago,
she broke a career-making case.</i>

152
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,885
- Did I stutter?
- Go ahead.

153
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,688
<i>But her partner at the
time took all the credit.</i>

154
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,523
<i>So while he made captain,</i>

155
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:45,391
<i>she got stuck at detective
level with this idiot.</i>

156
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,493
Okay, you think one guy
got all four?

157
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,195
Wait, wait, wait.

158
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,797
I'm just saying,
we got four dead bodies here, you know.

159
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,232
- One guy... Bullet holes.
- I'm trying to work.

160
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,035
I'm sorry. Go ahead and work.
Go ahead.

161
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,609
The shooter got close before drawing.
Six rounds.

162
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,511
Two for each of these three.

163
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,913
Yo, mind your debt.

164
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,181
I'm telling you.

165
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,315
That girl, Angelina,
she's a princess.

166
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,783
- Whoa. Hey.
- Look at this.

167
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,352
- Is it Halloween?
- Hey. How you doing?

168
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,466
And it wasn't about them.

169
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:29,869
It was all about this guy,
right here.

170
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,942
Do you know
who I am?

171
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,945
You fucking bitch.

172
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,890
And this arrow
through his throat...

173
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,161
She wanted him
to die slowly.

174
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:58,064
- She?
- We got a hair.

175
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,032
And he's got
a new assassin.

176
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,300
Who does?

177
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,271
Roman Beauvais Sionis.

178
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:08,040
Jesus Christ.

179
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,042
This is Montoya.
What the hell was that?

180
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:13,546
Shit.

181
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,549
Wow.

182
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,084
- Detective.
- Yep?

183
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,986
Found this necklace.

184
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,656
Holy shit.

185
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,426
Good work, Officer.

186
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,327
What is it?

187
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,598
Harley Quinn and
the Joker broke up.

188
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:33,834
What?

189
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:35,401
This was their spot.

190
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,404
She just publicly updated
her relationship status.

191
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,876
Harley Quinn just called
open season on herself.

192
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,510
She did not
think this one through.

193
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,413
<i>Yeah, no shit
I didn't think it through.</i>

194
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,682
<i>I'm about to learn
that a lot of people</i>

195
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,384
<i>in this city want me dead.</i>

196
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:54,855
<i>And at the top of
that list is this guy.</i>

197
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:59,992
Mr. Keo and his lovely
wife and daughter.

198
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,161
You kinda forced
my hand here.

199
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,630
Gotta say,
I'm a little disappointed.

200
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:12,038
I gave you a great pitch.
Didn't I?

201
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,641
And I thought... Shh!

202
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:19,979
I thought we could build
something beautiful together.

203
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,849
I thought we could
be family.

204
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,630
I'm gonna set you free.

205
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,099
Mmm...

206
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:45,638
What about her?

207
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,578
I think we can let her go.

208
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,715
I mean, this is a pretty loud
fucking shitshow of a message.

209
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,089
Baby. Aww.

210
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:05,024
Don't cry.

211
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,795
Thank you.
Thank you.

212
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,030
You're welcome.

213
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,034
Is that a snot bubble?

214
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,403
- Ew. Gross.
- What?

215
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,072
Oh, I've changed my mind.
Peel it off.

216
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,741
No. No!

217
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,378
<i>The wack
job with the penchant</i>

218
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:28,514
<i>for peeling faces
is Roman Sionis,</i>

219
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,682
<i>aka</i>

220
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,551
<i>Black Mask.</i>

221
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:37,757
<i>The fact that he wants me
dead hasn't yet hit my radar.</i>

222
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:40,660
<i>See, I was halfway across town,</i>

223
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:44,263
<i>hungover,
and thinking about breakfast.</i>

224
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:51,370
<i>Egg, bacon,
American cheese.</i>

225
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:55,741
<i>Soft, toasted buttered roll.</i>

226
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:58,644
<i>Just a dash
of hot sauce.</i>

227
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,079
Not too much, Sal.

228
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,315
I wanna taste the cheese.

229
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,251
<i>What a way to
start my new life.</i>

230
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:10,824
<i>With the perfect
egg sandwich.</i>

231
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:12,558
Mmm!

232
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:15,661
You're a lifesaver, Sal.

233
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,634
And I'm good for the 75 cents, okay?
I promise.

234
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:24,437
That's all the money
I got in the world,

235
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,405
and it's so worth it.

236
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,578
<i>I don't know if it's
the stray Armenian arm hair,</i>

237
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,313
<i>or the fact that
his cheese slices</i>

238
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,215
<i>are always six months
out of date,</i>

239
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:40,020
<i>but no one makes
an egg sandwich like Sal.</i>

240
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:42,254
I mean it, Sal.
No one.

241
00:13:58,038 --> 00:13:59,605
Freeze! Gotham PD.

242
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,843
<i>Yeah, I don't think so.</i>

243
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:04,310
Are you fucking kidding me?

244
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:10,316
Yo! Police.

245
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,451
<i>It had
been six short hours</i>

246
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,253
<i>since my little stunt
at Ace Chemicals</i>

247
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,621
<i>announced to the world</i>

248
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,457
<i>that Mr. J and I
were dunzo.</i>

249
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:23,195
<i>The immunity I'd enjoyed
for so long was gone.</i>

250
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,066
<i>Cops who never would've
dared come after me before</i>

251
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:28,035
<i>were suddenly doing this.</i>

252
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,909
Ooh!

253
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,243
Freeze!

254
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,879
- <i>And what's worse?</i>
- Move!

255
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:40,713
<i>Every person I ever
wronged now felt free</i>

256
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,949
<i>to come and
take their pound of flesh.</i>

257
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,702
<i>Turns out I wronged
a lot of people.</i>

258
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,440
Come on, boy. Get him!

259
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:09,876
Oh...

260
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:25,892
Finally.

261
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:36,669
<i>And then...</i>

262
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:37,904
We're gonna
get through this, okay?

263
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,472
<i>...tragedy struck.</i>

264
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:53,887
<i>It took losing
something I truly love</i>

265
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,857
<i>for me to see that
the target on my back</i>

266
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:58,457
<i>was bigger
than I thought.</i>

267
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,761
Freeze.

268
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,164
<i>With the walls
closing in around me,</i>

269
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:05,731
<i>I made a carefully calculated,</i>

270
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,300
<i>highly strategic move.</i>

271
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:20,147
<i>Fine. It was dumb luck.
But still...</i>

272
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,580
That felt pretty great.

273
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,552
Sorry for busting in
on you like that,

274
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,021
but thanks
for the shortcut.

275
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,522
See ya. Oh!

276
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,925
There she is.

277
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:32,993
Harley Quinn.

278
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,494
Yeah?

279
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,296
I've waited
a long time for this.

280
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,999
You have?

281
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:40,967
Oh...

282
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,869
I haven't had breakfast yet.

283
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,839
What did I do to you?

284
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:47,473
Are you serious?

285
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,043
Look at my face.

286
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,412
Look at my face!

287
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:00,586
Oh...

288
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:03,489
That wasn't me.

289
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,491
But you dared him
to do it.

290
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,393
Yeah, but I dare
a lot of people

291
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,995
to do a lot of things, okay? Come on.
I'm not even with him anymore.

292
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:10,063
I know.

293
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,866
That means

294
00:17:12,933 --> 00:17:14,968
there's no one here
to stop me.

295
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,104
- Right.
- You're gonna die, Quinn.

296
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:19,405
Ooh. A penny.

297
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,413
They're shooting arrows now?

298
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,959
Ah, crap.

299
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:40,492
Him, too?

300
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,737
Parley?

301
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:58,477
Fuck, Montoya,
you smell like a dead rat's asshole.

302
00:17:58,544 --> 00:17:59,980
Not today, Simpson.

303
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:02,282
Hey, it's Detective Montoya.
Respect your elders.

304
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:04,383
I mean, your elderly.

305
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,718
You're only a few years
younger than me,

306
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,053
and you're still
behind that desk.

307
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,454
You wanna go there?

308
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,489
Come on. Empty your pockets.
All of it.

309
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,826
Cassandra Cain,
back already?

310
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:16,096
Thought by now you'd figure
out how not to get caught.

311
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:18,832
What? No comeback?

312
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:23,769
You all right?

313
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:26,705
You smell like shit.

314
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,543
Yo, Simpson.

315
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,880
Any clean clothes
in lost and found?

316
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:39,986
These are serious accusations,
Miss Montoya.

317
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:41,888
The Sionis family name
is on

318
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,555
half the museums and
schools in Gotham.

319
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,992
And that makes him
immune to the law, Captain?

320
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:49,728
<i>Montoya's day is
going almost as badly as mine.</i>

321
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,132
<i>Remember the guy
who stole her promotion?</i>

322
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:53,432
<i>That's him.</i>

323
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,467
He had four people killed
alone last night.

324
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,270
If Roman Sionis is
such a mastermind,

325
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:59,538
how'd he get fired
from his own fucking company?

326
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:00,807
The Janus Corporation is

327
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:02,574
his father's company,
thank you.

328
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,878
And by the way,
they cut him off.

329
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:07,546
Where does the DA's office
stand on all this?

330
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:08,915
<i>To make
matters worse,</i>

331
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,749
<i>the assistant DA?
That's her ex.</i>

332
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,253
The evidence that Sionis is
linked to these murders...

333
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,255
There's a shipment
coming in.

334
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:16,488
Drugs?

335
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,124
- A diamond.
- A diamond.

336
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:19,826
Wow, Montoya.
Should we call the Feds for backup?

337
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:22,162
Listen,
I had a source at the club.

338
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:23,830
His driver.

339
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,398
He said that Roman couldn't
stop talking about this thing.

340
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,632
And he said that
he overheard

341
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:27,733
something about
laser-encoding.

342
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:29,169
Now, I did some research.

343
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:31,905
I think
it's the Bertinelli diamond.

344
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:34,707
You remember the Bertinelli
massacre, right?

345
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,209
<i>Quick history lesson.</i>

346
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:38,044
<i>Fifteen years ago,
one of the wealthiest</i>

347
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,847
<i>Mafia families in Gotham
was gunned down.</i>

348
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:43,549
<i>It was a power grab,
but the real target</i>

349
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,684
<i>was the Bertinellis'
super-secret</i>

350
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,054
<i>offshore bank accounts,</i>

351
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:49,755
<i>the details of which
were said to be encoded</i>

352
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:53,460
<i>in the atomic structure
of a 30-carat diamond.</i>

353
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,161
<i>The rock was lost.</i>

354
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:58,564
<i>And with it, the only key
to the Bertinelli fortune.</i>

355
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,566
Which is exactly
why Roman Sionis

356
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,203
is trying to
get his hands on it.

357
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,305
That's what makes him
so dangerous.

358
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:07,107
He's already
building an army.

359
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:08,208
If he gets the diamond,

360
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:09,843
he'll have all the money
and connections

361
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,045
to bribe every single
judge and cop

362
00:20:12,112 --> 00:20:14,180
he needs to get a
monopoly on the city.

363
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:16,216
You said you had
someone on the inside?

364
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:19,886
Yes. He's...

365
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:21,087
He's no longer
there, but...

366
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:23,323
So basically,
you have nothing.

367
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,358
You are trying to go after

368
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:28,228
one of the most litigious and
wealthiest families in Gotham,

369
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:30,529
and all you've got is
rumors and a hunch?

370
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,165
Well, you know,

371
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,533
the DA's office is building
a case against him, too.

372
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,935
Isn't that right,
Miss Yee?

373
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:37,904
Listen, if the DA
is willing to throw himself

374
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:40,672
out in front of this,
it's fine with me.

375
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,841
Captain, no.

376
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,709
Listen, Munroe, find me

377
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:46,146
some tangible connection
to Sionis, all right?

378
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:48,448
- Yes, sir.
- Wait, wait, wait. Captain.

379
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:49,782
This is my case, okay?

380
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:51,550
I've been working on this
for six months.

381
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:56,222
We need something that we
can actually use, Detective.

382
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:58,158
And, Miss Montoya,
we do have a dress code.

383
00:21:02,062 --> 00:21:04,230
- Look, I'm sorry about that, but I...
- No.

384
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:05,899
That is my job
you are fucking with.

385
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,633
What is wrong
with you, Renee?

386
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,402
Me?
He gave my case away.

387
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,004
Oh, poor Renee.

388
00:21:11,071 --> 00:21:12,439
Why don't you pour yourself a drink?
It's almost noon.

389
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:13,506
Wow.

390
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:19,245
Jesus. Who the fuck is this?
What?

391
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:21,181
<i>Why the fuck haven't you</i>

392
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:22,482
<i>been picking up your phone?
We've got a situation.</i>

393
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:23,883
What... What situation?

394
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,318
<i>You didn't hear this
from me,</i>

395
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:27,420
but you gotta find her
before someone else does.

396
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:29,923
She's got the diamond, and trust
me, Roman will kill her.

397
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:31,590
My diamond? Who?
Who's got it?

398
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,059
<i>This kid.</i>

399
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:36,062
She's a pickpocket.
Her name's Cassandra Cain.

400
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:38,064
Holy fuck.

401
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,043
Can I help you?

402
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,478
Why, yes.
Yes, you can.

403
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:53,645
I'm here to
report a terrible crime.

404
00:21:55,115 --> 00:21:57,350
And what terrible crime
is that?

405
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:00,987
This one.

406
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:19,606
Hi, boys.

407
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,812
Meeting's over.

408
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:26,772
Run, piggy, run.

409
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:36,416
Where can I find
Cassandra Cain?

410
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:40,987
<i>Hold up, hold up.
I'm telling this all wrong.</i>

411
00:23:41,054 --> 00:23:42,655
<i>Let's rewind.</i>

412
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,324
<i>For you to understand
why me,</i>

413
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,892
<i>the cop,
and that dame on the toilet...</i>

414
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:47,327
Her name's Cassandra Cain.

415
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:49,929
<i>...are all looking for
this Cain character...</i>

416
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:52,565
<i>I gotta take you back
a few days,</i>

417
00:23:52,632 --> 00:23:56,135
<i>to that night I got shitfaced
at the Black Mask Club.</i>

418
00:23:58,538 --> 00:24:03,876

...short notice like this.

429
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:31,104
I'm not talking
superficial partnerships.

430
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:35,675
I'm talking you and me
having each other's backs.

431
00:24:35,742 --> 00:24:37,176
The Golden Lions can't just

432
00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:39,412
wander into
Gotham National Bank.

433
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,880
I can.

434
00:24:40,947 --> 00:24:43,383
Loans, liquidity, laundering.

435
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:46,452
Look, if you bring your boys
into the fold,

436
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:49,956
there are no limits to what
we could achieve together.

437
00:24:50,023 --> 00:24:53,126
I'm building
something special.

438
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:55,794
I appreciate your offer,
Mr. Sionis.

439
00:24:55,862 --> 00:24:59,032
But with all due respect,

440
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:01,401
the Golden Lions
are a family business.

441
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:04,971
Fuck family.
All due respect, but fuck that.

442
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:06,406
Family's a fucking illusion.

443
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:08,875
You know what my family gave me?
Nothing.

444
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:10,510
I know what everyone says.

445
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:12,211
"Here comes Roman Sionis.

446
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:14,414
He was handed life
on a silver spoon."

447
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,482
"Gin and tonics at 5:00."
"I'll have the duck."

448
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:19,719
Blah, blah, blah.
Fake fucking fucks.

449
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:23,423
But look at me now.

450
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:26,192
I've located
the Bertinelli diamond.

451
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:28,061
I'm about to own this city.

452
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:29,996
Not just the East End.

453
00:25:30,063 --> 00:25:31,964
I am thinking big, baby.

454
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:35,034
And I want you there with me.

455
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:37,236
We could make
our own family.

456
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:38,204
Mr. Sionis,

457
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:39,739
the Golden Lions
have operated

458
00:25:39,807 --> 00:25:41,507
in Gotham
for nearly 100 years.

459
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:45,878
We have no need
of your protection.

460
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:48,381
<i>He's gonna
regret that.</i>

461
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:59,325
Will you sleep on it?
Will you do that for me?

462
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,294
Run it by that
beautiful wife of yours,

463
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:03,730
and I'll come see you at the
docks, day after tomorrow.

464
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:05,064

00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,389

Come on!

481
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:07,160
<i>He calls
her his little bird,</i>

482
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:08,694
<i>and he's got her wrapped</i>

483
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:11,197
<i>right around
his fancy little finger.</i>

484
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:17,437
Here you go, Canary.

485
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:18,604
Thank you.

486
00:27:19,873 --> 00:27:22,575
How do you spell "mercenary"?

487
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:24,977
Merceninny...

488
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:27,246
Merceran?

489
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,355
Singer lady woman!

490
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:39,358
You're really, really good.

491
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:40,426
Yeah.

492
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:48,734
Know what a harlequin is?

493
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:53,673
Janky-ass clown
with bad eye makeup?

494
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:55,074
Oof!

495
00:27:55,608 --> 00:27:57,109
Ouch!

496
00:28:00,613 --> 00:28:03,049
A harlequin's role

497
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,185
is to serve.

498
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:08,454
An audience.

499
00:28:08,956 --> 00:28:11,090
A master.

500
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:17,029
You know, a harlequin's
nothing without a master.

501
00:28:18,832 --> 00:28:23,769
And no one gives two fucks
who we are beyond that.

502
00:28:32,512 --> 00:28:34,547
Yeah, I don't know who
you think I am, lady,

503
00:28:34,614 --> 00:28:35,615
but I'm not her.

504
00:28:38,251 --> 00:28:40,319
Puddin' and I broke up.

505
00:28:47,493 --> 00:28:50,129
I haven't told that
to anyone.

506
00:28:51,531 --> 00:28:53,566
Yeah.

507
00:28:53,633 --> 00:28:55,401
For good this time.

508
00:28:57,103 --> 00:29:00,706
And for the first time
in a long time,

509
00:29:01,975 --> 00:29:04,243
I'm all on my lonesome.

510
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:10,416
It's great.

511
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,555
Welcome to the club.

512
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:18,391
Thanks.

513
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:22,628
Hey, don't be lonesome.
How about another drink?

514
00:29:22,695 --> 00:29:24,297
- Yes!
- Yeah?

515
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:25,933
- Yeah.
- It's on me.

516
00:29:25,999 --> 00:29:28,200
- Sure. Drinks!
- Hey, two shots.

517
00:29:31,504 --> 00:29:33,205
Hey.

518
00:29:42,415 --> 00:29:44,750
We're all good here.

519
00:29:57,697 --> 00:30:00,366
- I don't wanna go home.
- Oh, no? No.

520
00:30:00,433 --> 00:30:02,201
No.

521
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:06,405
Let me know
if you're gonna get sick.

522
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:09,208
Your chariot's arrived.
Oh, there you go.

523
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:10,509
Are we getting breakfast?

524
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:12,211
Hey, buddy,
I'm gonna need some help.

525
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:13,914
This is my friend.

526
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:15,381
I told you all about...

527
00:30:15,448 --> 00:30:16,582
Hey, get the door, man.
I got her, I got her.

528
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:18,618
- There we go.
- Wait.

529
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:20,786
Isn't that Joker's girl?

530
00:30:20,854 --> 00:30:21,922
Not anymore.

531
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:23,155
Got room
for one more?

532
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:24,423
Hey.

533
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:26,726
Huh?

534
00:30:29,462 --> 00:30:33,165
I don't need your help.
I got this.

535
00:30:33,232 --> 00:30:35,768
You got this?
You sure about that?

536
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:37,838
Yeah, no wonder
everyone hates you.

537
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,209
Uh...

538
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,387
You got this!

539
00:30:55,989 --> 00:30:58,391
You motherfucker!

540
00:31:00,226 --> 00:31:01,862
Whoo!

541
00:31:05,132 --> 00:31:08,334
Well, well, well,
well, well, well.

542
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:11,537
Could that be
our little Miss Lance?

543
00:31:11,604 --> 00:31:13,339
All these years,
I thought she was just

544
00:31:13,406 --> 00:31:15,842
a pretty face
and a fine set of lungs.

545
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,278
Ooh.

546
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:24,151
Mr. Zsasz,
I've had an amazing idea.

547
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,626
That's my little bird.

548
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:40,100
Don't touch what you can't
afford, mister.

549
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:41,367
Shut up.

550
00:31:43,136 --> 00:31:46,305
Oh, songbird.

551
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:48,474
You drive
as good as you fight?

552
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:52,578
Who's asking?

553
00:31:52,645 --> 00:31:54,213
The boss.

554
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,949
You're getting promoted.

555
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:00,519
You're his new driver.

556
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:03,123
Huh. Thanks,
but I think I'm good

557
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,390
with the singing gig.

558
00:32:04,457 --> 00:32:06,459
You'll be good
at the driving gig.

559
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:11,697
Be here tomorrow.
9:00 a.m. Sharp.

560
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:14,366
<i>So,
that's how Canary got herself a job</i>

561
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:17,336
<i>driving around
Gotham's newest Godfather.</i>

562
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:20,639
<i>A position, I might add,
that wouldn't have been vacant</i>

563
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:23,542
<i>without the help
of yours truly.</i>

564
00:32:30,884 --> 00:32:31,684
Morning.

565
00:32:42,896 --> 00:32:44,697
You're
the one who wanted the kid!

566
00:32:44,764 --> 00:32:46,465
I never wanted her!

567
00:32:48,969 --> 00:32:50,636
Let me guess. Parents?

568
00:32:51,337 --> 00:32:52,638
Foster parents.

569
00:32:52,705 --> 00:32:53,706
Right.

570
00:32:54,774 --> 00:32:56,609
Sorry, kid.

571
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:59,411
Sorry about your face.

572
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,915
Shit, you do have something
on your face.

573
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:05,384
You should've seen
the other guy.

574
00:33:08,021 --> 00:33:09,622
Uh...

575
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:10,790
I want

576
00:33:10,857 --> 00:33:12,658
that kid out of
my fucking house!

577
00:33:12,725 --> 00:33:15,427
You know, kid,
not every day is gonna be like this.

578
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,663
You just gotta
hang in there.

579
00:33:23,636 --> 00:33:25,404
Get something to eat.

580
00:33:26,873 --> 00:33:29,642
Stay outta that.
It's not worth it.

581
00:33:38,251 --> 00:33:39,718
Don't
talk to me like that.

582
00:33:42,755 --> 00:33:44,390
<i>Canary spends the next week</i>

583
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:47,894
<i>settling in to her new job
as Roman's personal driver.</i>

584
00:33:57,037 --> 00:33:58,671
Ew. Okay.

585
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:00,106
<i>What she didn't know</i>

586
00:34:00,173 --> 00:34:01,808
<i>is that driving
Mr. Face-peely-pants</i>

587
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:04,343
<i>was gonna put her
right in the crosshairs</i>

588
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,847
<i>of my favorite little piggy.</i>

589
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:08,647
Dinah Lance?

590
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:09,983
Who the hell are you?

591
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:13,652
I'm Renee Montoya,
detective with GCPD.

592
00:34:16,022 --> 00:34:20,093
Your predecessor
and I had an arrangement.

593
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,594
Oh, really?

594
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,863
He told me
that there was

595
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:26,099
a shipment coming in.
A diamond.

596
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:29,236
A very special diamond.

597
00:34:29,302 --> 00:34:32,638
Yeah, not interested, lady.
Thanks for the coffee.

598
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:36,843
Do you know
who you're working for?

599
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,477
You're damn right, I do.
He's the man who

600
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:40,512
gave me a job.
Took me off the streets.

601
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,382
Yeah, well, he's also
a very dangerous man.

602
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:46,253
A criminal. A murderer.

603
00:34:46,319 --> 00:34:47,586
What would
your mother think of

604
00:34:47,653 --> 00:34:49,722
you working for
a guy like that, huh?

605
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:51,992
You have
the same power she had.

606
00:34:52,058 --> 00:34:53,860
Don't you think she
would want you to use it?

607
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:55,794
The hell do you know
about my mother?

608
00:34:55,862 --> 00:34:58,899
Back in the day,
she used to help the GCPD.

609
00:34:58,965 --> 00:35:01,567
- She was a good woman.
- Yeah.

610
00:35:01,634 --> 00:35:04,037
She was
a damn good woman.

611
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:05,504
The kind of woman

612
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:07,974
who put everyone else's lives
before her own.

613
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:10,743
And when she was found
dead in the street,

614
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:14,881
where the fuck were you
and your boys in blue then?

615
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:16,883
Now you wanna come
and knock on my door

616
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,852
and ask me
to help you out

617
00:35:18,919 --> 00:35:21,054
and make the same
mistake she did?

618
00:35:22,822 --> 00:35:25,724
Yeah.
Good luck with that.

619
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:28,895
That's fair enough.

620
00:35:28,962 --> 00:35:31,031
And I'm sorry
for your loss.

621
00:35:32,365 --> 00:35:34,733
For the record,

622
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:38,204
that would never happen
on my watch.

623
00:35:40,773 --> 00:35:43,442
The Sprang Bridge
Soldiers capituated.

624
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:45,946
"Capitulated."
Of course they did.

625
00:35:46,012 --> 00:35:48,447
I told you that Keo scene
would send a message.

626
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,517
It sure did, boss.

627
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:53,485
It sure fucking did.

628
00:35:53,552 --> 00:35:55,989
Crossbow Killer

629
00:35:57,057 --> 00:35:59,192
struck again last night.

630
00:35:59,259 --> 00:36:00,860
Rossi and four of his guys.

631
00:36:00,927 --> 00:36:03,863
People don't kill people I
own without my permission.

632
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:05,865
Why doesn't this crossbow guy
know that?

633
00:36:05,932 --> 00:36:07,566
- You know that!
- I know it.

634
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:08,767
Why doesn't this crossbow guy?

635
00:36:08,835 --> 00:36:10,669
Why don't I own
the crossbow guy?

636
00:36:10,736 --> 00:36:13,807
- You should own him.
- I mean, I like crossbows.

637
00:36:13,873 --> 00:36:15,875
Oh, good morning.
Good morning.

638
00:36:15,942 --> 00:36:17,543
- Morning.
- Come in. Come in.

639
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:20,447
We're just finishing up a little business.
Look around.

640
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,349
- You're late.
- It's fine.

641
00:36:22,415 --> 00:36:24,516
Should she come back another
time, 'cause she's late?

642
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:26,652
No. Isn't this stunning?

643
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:31,523
That is a Chokwe mask.

644
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,626
I got it when I was embedded
with the Mbangani tribe

645
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,762
in Congo-Kinshasa.
Have you ever been?

646
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:37,897
- I've never been.
- Mmm.

647
00:36:37,964 --> 00:36:39,232
I've heard it's beautiful.

648
00:36:39,299 --> 00:36:40,900
- It's dirty.
- Oh...

649
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:45,105
Here, look at this.
Genuine tsantsa or shrunken head.

650
00:36:45,171 --> 00:36:46,572
Shuar of Ecuador.

651
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:48,108
They're amazing people.
Surprisingly gentle.

652
00:36:48,174 --> 00:36:50,176
- I think you might like them.
- Really?

653
00:36:50,243 --> 00:36:52,578
Mmm. They boil the
heads of their enemies

654
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:54,513
and they make
these little fellas.

655
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,216
- Exquisite, aren't they? Look.
- Mmm-hmm.

656
00:36:56,282 --> 00:36:59,651
Look at those little ears.
And his little haircut.

657
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,421
- Yeah, he's 1,000 years old.
- Wow.

658
00:37:01,488 --> 00:37:03,456
And now he's just an
ornament in my living room.

659
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:05,624
- Ew! I love it.
- Yeah?

660
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:07,293
These are
ancient acupuncture models.

661
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,030
As you can see,
they have all the acupuncture points.

662
00:37:10,096 --> 00:37:13,166
And we found these
buried in the mountains.

663
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:16,436
Ace Chemicals got blown
sky high last night.

664
00:37:16,503 --> 00:37:17,871
All right, all right,

665
00:37:17,937 --> 00:37:20,140
let's find the Crossbow Killer.
I get it.

666
00:37:20,206 --> 00:37:22,042
Is he an acupuncture model,
too?

667
00:37:22,108 --> 00:37:23,776
He is not
an acupuncture model.

668
00:37:23,843 --> 00:37:25,345
This is a statue of me.

669
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:27,013
It was made by a very
famous Gotham artist...

670
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,782
Harley Quinn
did it.

671
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:32,252
Some kind of "fuck you"
to the Joker.

672
00:37:32,785 --> 00:37:34,054
They split.

673
00:37:35,121 --> 00:37:37,689
What's wrong with you,
Victor?

674
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,827
- Talk about burying the lede.
- Yeah.

675
00:37:40,894 --> 00:37:43,863
This is spectacular news!

676
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:46,332
She doesn't belong to him,
she belongs to me.

677
00:37:46,399 --> 00:37:47,867
Have the boys
go find her.

678
00:37:47,934 --> 00:37:49,768
Round her up, bring her back.
I want her.

679
00:37:49,836 --> 00:37:51,805
You, I have something
I want you to pick me up.

680
00:37:51,871 --> 00:37:54,340
Something super-duper
important, okay?

681
00:37:54,407 --> 00:37:55,741
- Okay.
- I'll go with you.

682
00:37:55,809 --> 00:37:57,609
- Yeah, go with Victor.
- It's just a pickup.

683
00:37:57,676 --> 00:37:59,212
No, he's harmless.

684
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:01,548
Do as you're told. Go.

685
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:17,464
All right.
We can go.

686
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:18,865
I'll take that.

687
00:38:18,932 --> 00:38:20,467
Mr. S said for me
to hold on to it.

688
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:22,368
Go get your car.

689
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:28,041
<i>That rock.
That rock's about to become the key</i>

690
00:38:28,108 --> 00:38:29,608
<i>to whether or not
I live to</i>

691
00:38:29,675 --> 00:38:31,878
<i>enjoy my newfound
independence.</i>

692
00:38:35,515 --> 00:38:36,816
Get off me.

693
00:38:36,883 --> 00:38:38,318
What the hell
are you doing here?

694
00:38:38,384 --> 00:38:40,053
You're not the only one
who makes money

695
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,322
off of dumb, rich,
white people.

696
00:38:42,388 --> 00:38:43,890
Well, you know what?

697
00:38:43,957 --> 00:38:45,657
One day you're gonna pick
the wrong pocket, sis.

698
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:48,027
Okay. Whatever.

699
00:38:50,864 --> 00:38:52,599
Dumb-ass kids.

700
00:38:54,801 --> 00:38:56,569
Excuse me. Sorry.

701
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,214
I really like your earrings.

702
00:39:08,281 --> 00:39:09,781
Why, thank you.

703
00:39:11,717 --> 00:39:13,685
There's the thief.
There's the thief.

704
00:39:16,089 --> 00:39:17,223
Get off of me!

705
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,926
That little girl
took my watch.

706
00:39:19,993 --> 00:39:21,928
I didn't do nothing.

707
00:39:24,564 --> 00:39:25,632
Where the fuck's
the diamond?

708
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,300
I just fucking had it.

709
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:29,202
Cass!

710
00:39:31,404 --> 00:39:32,505
Wait!

711
00:39:32,572 --> 00:39:33,940
Wait, wait!

712
00:39:35,408 --> 00:39:36,643
Halt!

713
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,744
Fuck!

714
00:39:58,131 --> 00:39:59,798
<i>In the
storytelling business,</i>

715
00:39:59,866 --> 00:40:03,036
<i>this dummy
swallowing that diamond</i>

716
00:40:03,102 --> 00:40:06,839
<i>is called a complication.</i>

717
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:10,742
<i>A complication I didn't
exactly need right now.</i>

718
00:40:13,546 --> 00:40:14,746
Parley?

719
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:20,019
We lost the diamond.

720
00:40:20,086 --> 00:40:21,187
What?

721
00:40:21,254 --> 00:40:22,889
We're really sorry, Mr. S.
This kid...

722
00:40:22,956 --> 00:40:25,258
We never even
got our hands on it.

723
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:27,793
Ow!

724
00:40:28,628 --> 00:40:30,729
Help!

725
00:40:30,796 --> 00:40:32,798
Get out!
Get out of here!

726
00:40:32,865 --> 00:40:35,001
You, too! Go!
With your fucking sage

727
00:40:35,068 --> 00:40:37,470
stinking my place up.
Fuck off!

728
00:40:37,537 --> 00:40:39,172
Here she is.

729
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:40,240
She's a child!

730
00:40:40,306 --> 00:40:41,507
- Mr. Sionis.
- She's just a kid.

731
00:40:41,574 --> 00:40:43,142
She's... What?

732
00:40:43,209 --> 00:40:44,978
We have Harley Quinn
downstairs, as requested.

733
00:40:45,044 --> 00:40:46,346
Fuck off! Get out.

734
00:40:46,412 --> 00:40:48,047
Fucking out!

735
00:40:48,114 --> 00:40:49,816
Fuck!
These are my things.

736
00:40:49,882 --> 00:40:51,517
- This diamond is my things.
- Yes.

737
00:40:51,584 --> 00:40:53,052
My things!

738
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,854
Fucking fuck!
I don't ask for much, do I?

739
00:40:54,921 --> 00:40:56,589
- No.
- Why is this happening to me?

740
00:40:56,656 --> 00:40:57,857
Why?

741
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,361
I'm gonna get
your diamond back.

742
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:03,963
I promise.

743
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:09,068
Why don't we go downstairs
and kill that Harley bitch?

744
00:41:10,436 --> 00:41:12,572
Blow off a little steam.

745
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,541
Yeah, I have wanted to do
that for quite some time.

746
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:20,179
Okay.
I'll go get changed.

747
00:41:35,495 --> 00:41:37,130
Shit, Cass.

748
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:45,538
I don't care what it
takes, I want my diamond back.

749
00:41:45,605 --> 00:41:47,907
We're working on it.

750
00:41:47,974 --> 00:41:50,810
Now, let's go have a little fun.

751
00:41:55,615 --> 00:42:00,520
Harleen Quinzel.

752
00:42:00,586 --> 00:42:01,587
Whoo!

753
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:04,324
Hiya, Romy.

754
00:42:05,525 --> 00:42:08,094
Do you know why you're here?
Hmm?

755
00:42:08,161 --> 00:42:09,862
<i>When it comes to
me and Roman Sionis,</i>

756
00:42:09,929 --> 00:42:12,732
<i>there are a lot of possible
answers to this question.</i>

757
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:14,300
<i>Breaking his driver's legs.</i>

758
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:16,369
<i>There's that time
I called it an "expresso."</i>

759
00:42:16,436 --> 00:42:17,970
<i>Having a vagina in the first
place pisses this guy off.</i>

760
00:42:22,342 --> 00:42:25,111
<i>Constantly interrupting him,
like I'm doing right now.</i>

761
00:42:25,178 --> 00:42:27,413
- You're here because...
- Oh, God, stop.

762
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,749
You're gonna do that
thing where you open up

763
00:42:29,817 --> 00:42:31,317
a weird-ass case
of torture devices

764
00:42:31,384 --> 00:42:33,886
while inexplicably
detailing your master plan

765
00:42:33,953 --> 00:42:35,221
and how
I don't fit into it.

766
00:42:35,288 --> 00:42:36,656
I'm building a better...

767
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:38,257
Seriously, you don't have to.
Really!

768
00:42:38,324 --> 00:42:39,792
You're building
a criminal empire

769
00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:41,694
because Daddy kicked
you out of Janus Corp.

770
00:42:41,761 --> 00:42:43,496
And you think this is a big
"fuck you," but in actuality

771
00:42:43,563 --> 00:42:45,331
it's a very misguided attempt
to win back his respect.

772
00:42:45,398 --> 00:42:48,534
I get it. You're really not
as complicated as you think.

773
00:42:48,601 --> 00:42:50,603
And you're really not as
clever as you think, because

774
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,972
- now I'm gonna slice your...
- Oh, Jesus Christmas.

775
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:55,174
Now you're gonna say
that you wanna kill me

776
00:42:55,241 --> 00:42:57,143
to set an example.
Christ, you're boring.

777
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:59,912
- I wanna kill you...
- Shit.

778
00:42:59,979 --> 00:43:02,281
...because without
the Joker around,

779
00:43:03,817 --> 00:43:05,418
I can.

780
00:43:08,287 --> 00:43:11,391
For all your noise
and bluster,

781
00:43:11,457 --> 00:43:12,860
you're just
a silly little girl

782
00:43:12,925 --> 00:43:14,927
with no one around
to protect her.

783
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:21,267
- Whoa. Wait.
- What?

784
00:43:21,334 --> 00:43:22,870
- Don't kill me.
- Ha! Right.

785
00:43:22,935 --> 00:43:24,637
No, no, no. Seriously. Romy, Roman.

786
00:43:24,704 --> 00:43:26,539
Come on. There's gotta be something,

787
00:43:26,606 --> 00:43:29,108
something we can figure out. Hey!

788
00:43:29,175 --> 00:43:31,377
Wait, wait!
You lost something, right?

789
00:43:31,444 --> 00:43:32,945
You lost something.
I heard you say it.

790
00:43:33,012 --> 00:43:34,213
A diamond.

791
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:41,053
Yeah.

792
00:43:42,188 --> 00:43:44,390
I can help you
find it.

793
00:43:44,457 --> 00:43:47,593
Seriously.
Look in my pocket.

794
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:52,165
Other pocket.

795
00:44:01,174 --> 00:44:03,109
I'm starting up
my own business.

796
00:44:03,176 --> 00:44:04,644
See what it says?
Second from the bottom.

797
00:44:09,048 --> 00:44:11,885
I know the East End
better than anybody.

798
00:44:11,951 --> 00:44:15,121
You want this diamond back?
I'm your gal.

799
00:44:15,188 --> 00:44:17,390
Mr. J once lost
a rare photograph

800
00:44:17,457 --> 00:44:18,892
of a nude
Eleanor Roosevelt,

801
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:21,093
and I found it in a bird's
nest in Robinson Park.

802
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,296
If you let me go,

803
00:44:23,362 --> 00:44:27,300
just for now,
I'll get you that rock back.

804
00:44:27,366 --> 00:44:29,502
What have you got to lose?
If your boys find it first,

805
00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:31,437
swear to God,
you can kill me later.

806
00:44:31,504 --> 00:44:34,106
Pinky swear.
Cross my heart, hope to fart.

807
00:44:34,173 --> 00:44:35,641
You're so tiresome!

808
00:44:37,143 --> 00:44:38,778
If you want my mercy,

809
00:44:38,846 --> 00:44:42,315
shut that hole in the middle
of your face and listen.

810
00:44:42,381 --> 00:44:45,218

get me my diamond.

off that pretty face

and pickle it.

829
00:45:44,043 --> 00:45:45,411

I promise.

Let's make it
half a mil.

835
00:46:03,596 --> 00:46:05,731
It's more fun
if she's got competition.

836
00:46:05,798 --> 00:46:08,969
Send it to every
mercenary in Gotham.

837
00:46:09,036 --> 00:46:11,304
Oh, hey, you're that
singer no one listens to.

838
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:13,739
Hey, you're the asshole
no one likes.

- Harley Quinn.

You're the reason I'm in here!

860

Yeah, sorry about that.

You're dead!

862
00:48:07,353 --> 00:48:08,254
I'm gonna kill
you, Quinn!

863
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,289
Hey, kid.

864
00:48:10,356 --> 00:48:11,624
You're that psycho

865
00:48:11,691 --> 00:48:12,859
- from the roller derby.
- Yeah, yeah.

866
00:48:12,926 --> 00:48:14,527
Are you Cassandra Cain?

867
00:48:14,593 --> 00:48:15,728
Yeah.

868
00:48:27,406 --> 00:48:28,809

869
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,121

00:53:17,496 --> 00:53:18,764
You!

882
00:53:18,832 --> 00:53:19,732
You!

883
00:53:19,798 --> 00:53:21,667
Step away
from the kid.

884
00:53:22,836 --> 00:53:23,837
Drop it.

885
00:53:24,471 --> 00:53:25,671
The phone?

886
00:53:26,306 --> 00:53:27,573
Sure.

887
00:53:41,587 --> 00:53:42,621
Mmm.

888
00:54:02,342 --> 00:54:04,277
Whoa.

889
00:54:04,344 --> 00:54:05,744
Oh, good.
You're awake.

890
00:54:05,812 --> 00:54:07,780
Toss that for me, will ya?

891
00:54:21,194 --> 00:54:23,496
What the fuck?

892
00:54:23,562 --> 00:54:25,432
Who did I just blow up?

893
00:54:25,498 --> 00:54:27,500
Either someone
who wants me dead,

894
00:54:27,566 --> 00:54:28,935
or someone looking to collect

895
00:54:29,002 --> 00:54:31,304
the half-million dollar reward
on your head.

896
00:54:31,371 --> 00:54:33,239
Half a million dollars?

897
00:54:33,306 --> 00:54:34,808
Yeah.

898
00:54:34,874 --> 00:54:37,143
Do I look like I'm worth
half a million dollars?

899
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:39,345
- Not really.
- You've got the wrong kid.

900
00:54:39,412 --> 00:54:41,314
Now, uncuff me.

901
00:54:41,381 --> 00:54:43,049
Oh, sure.

902
00:54:43,116 --> 00:54:44,517
As soon as you
give me the diamond.

903
00:54:44,583 --> 00:54:46,286
What diamond?

904
00:54:52,658 --> 00:54:54,060
Fuck you!

905
00:54:55,661 --> 00:54:57,030
Look at me.

906
00:55:00,033 --> 00:55:01,067
What?

907
00:55:01,134 --> 00:55:03,503
I don't know
nothing about no diamond.

908
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:04,670
The inflection
in your voice,

909
00:55:04,736 --> 00:55:06,106
the way you can't
hold eye contact,

910
00:55:06,172 --> 00:55:07,440
and the fact that
you're a filthy little thief,

911
00:55:07,507 --> 00:55:08,942
all suggest that you do.

912
00:55:09,008 --> 00:55:11,478
Now, you can give it to
me, or I can give you

913
00:55:11,544 --> 00:55:13,046
to the man
that diamond belongs to.

914
00:55:13,113 --> 00:55:15,315
But trust me when I say,
you're not gonna like

915
00:55:15,381 --> 00:55:16,615
what he's gonna
do to ya.

916
00:55:17,417 --> 00:55:20,553
Now, hand it over.

917
00:55:20,619 --> 00:55:23,022
Yeah, not gonna happen.

918
00:55:24,491 --> 00:55:27,193
- Come again?
- I said I can't.

919
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,461
One more time.

920
00:55:28,528 --> 00:55:30,296
- I can't give it to you.
- Why not?

921
00:55:30,363 --> 00:55:32,298
Because I ate it, okay?

922
00:55:39,506 --> 00:55:40,706
Yes.

923
00:55:41,773 --> 00:55:43,943
What are we even doing here?

924
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:46,645
There are two ways that
diamond's coming outta ya.

925
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:48,948
This way,

926
00:55:50,383 --> 00:55:51,951
or this way.

927
00:55:53,987 --> 00:55:55,421
That's what I thought.

928
00:55:55,488 --> 00:55:57,257
Also, I'm outta groceries.

929
00:56:00,726 --> 00:56:03,695
So, how long you been
a mercenary?

930
00:56:04,497 --> 00:56:05,899
Hey, where did you get...

931
00:56:05,965 --> 00:56:08,301
You're so busy
looking at my right hand,

932
00:56:08,368 --> 00:56:10,203
you haven't even
thought about my left.

933
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:12,671
Your left hand is
cuffed to mine.

934
00:56:16,976 --> 00:56:19,045
I'll have
to learn that one.

935
00:56:20,146 --> 00:56:21,680
Can we get this?

936
00:56:21,747 --> 00:56:24,083
You're not gonna try to
run, are you?

937
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:26,519
Look, if there's really
a half mil on my head,

938
00:56:26,586 --> 00:56:27,921
I figure
I'm better off with

939
00:56:27,987 --> 00:56:29,522
the person who's not
gonna cut me open.

940
00:56:29,589 --> 00:56:32,625
Fine. But if you try to
run, I will kill you.

941
00:56:32,691 --> 00:56:35,028
I do not care
that you're a kid.

942
00:56:37,763 --> 00:56:39,999
I saw that.

943
00:56:40,066 --> 00:56:42,936
Seriously though,
how'd you get to be here?

944
00:56:43,002 --> 00:56:46,306
I mean,
shopping at fancy-ass stores,

945
00:56:46,372 --> 00:56:50,143
you're making bank,
you have your own business.

946
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:52,679
How'd you do it?
Come on, tell me.

947
00:56:52,744 --> 00:56:54,447
Woman to woman.

948
00:56:54,514 --> 00:56:58,651
Being a pickpocket's fine and
all, but I got real potential.

949
00:56:58,717 --> 00:57:00,486
I mean,
how do I be like you?

950
00:57:00,553 --> 00:57:04,824
Well, except for the crazy part.
But other than that.

951
00:57:04,891 --> 00:57:07,961
Number one,
no one is like me.

952
00:57:08,027 --> 00:57:09,761
If you wanted to
even come close,

953
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:11,130
you would have to
go to medical school.

954
00:57:11,197 --> 00:57:14,234
Become a psychiatrist,
work in an asylum.

955
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,734
Fall in love
with your patient,

956
00:57:15,802 --> 00:57:17,736
break said patient
out of said asylum.

957
00:57:17,804 --> 00:57:19,472
Begin a life of crime.

958
00:57:19,539 --> 00:57:21,207
Jump into a vat of chemicals
to prove yourself to a madman.

959
00:57:21,274 --> 00:57:23,142
Get arrested
by the Batman.

960
00:57:23,209 --> 00:57:24,877
Go back to jail,
get out of jail with a bomb on your neck.

961
00:57:24,944 --> 00:57:26,579
Save the world, go back to
jail, and break out of jail

962
00:57:26,646 --> 00:57:28,948
before breaking up
with the aforementioned madman

963
00:57:29,015 --> 00:57:30,917
and going out
on your own.

964
00:57:33,586 --> 00:57:35,622
Number two...

965
00:57:35,688 --> 00:57:37,257
Six bucks for tap water

966
00:57:37,323 --> 00:57:38,925
with a fucking cucumber stick
in it?

967
00:57:38,992 --> 00:57:40,159
That's crazy.

968
00:57:41,861 --> 00:57:44,063
I'm not shopping
at this store.

969
00:57:45,898 --> 00:57:47,766
I'm robbing this store.

970
00:57:47,834 --> 00:57:50,470
Consider this
your first lesson.

971
00:57:50,536 --> 00:57:52,805
Paying is for dummies.

972
00:57:58,978 --> 00:58:00,513
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

973
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,282
Move it!

974
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:09,222
Whoops. Ah...

975
00:58:11,357 --> 00:58:14,294
This is Doc's Place.
And this is Doc.

976
00:58:16,963 --> 00:58:18,797
Lotus flower!

977
00:58:18,865 --> 00:58:21,301
- Hiya, Doc. How are ya?
- Good.

978
00:58:21,367 --> 00:58:23,436
He's the Taiwanese grandpa
I never had.

979
00:58:23,503 --> 00:58:25,505
He knows everything
and everyone.

980
00:58:25,571 --> 00:58:27,273
Nothing happens around here,
let me tell you,

981
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:28,908
without Doc
knowing about it.

982
00:58:28,975 --> 00:58:32,011
And he happens to be
the only person

983
00:58:32,078 --> 00:58:33,913
who actually cares
about me.

984
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,648
- I do?
- Yes, you do.

985
00:58:35,715 --> 00:58:37,216
She's been ordering #32

986
00:58:37,283 --> 00:58:39,419
with extra chili
for many years.

987
00:58:39,485 --> 00:58:40,553
Lesson number two,

988
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:42,488
you always want
extra chili with #32.

989
00:58:42,555 --> 00:58:44,424
So you don't
have to taste his cooking.

990
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:47,427
Lotus flower, you have to get
upstairs before someone sees.

991
00:58:47,493 --> 00:58:49,796
Everyone's looking for you.
And you.

992
00:58:49,862 --> 00:58:51,764
We know.

993
00:58:51,831 --> 00:58:55,268
I'm telling you,
if you want boys to respect you,

994
00:58:55,335 --> 00:58:57,937
you have to show them
that you're serious.

995
00:58:58,004 --> 00:59:01,474
Blow something up.
Shoot someone.

996
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:03,943
Nothing gets a guy's
attention like violence.

997
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:06,112
Shut that door.
Lock it.

998
00:59:06,179 --> 00:59:08,548
Keep your sticky paws
to yourself, okay?

999
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:20,860
This place...

1000
00:59:20,927 --> 00:59:22,895
Well, it ain't much,
but it's better than a prison cell.

1001
00:59:22,962 --> 00:59:24,897
...is so fucking dope.

1002
00:59:26,733 --> 00:59:29,635
Oh, shit.
Is that a hyena in a bathtub?

1003
00:59:29,702 --> 00:59:32,972
I named him Bruce after
that hunky Wayne guy.

1004
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:35,775
He's my little dumpling,
aren't you?

1005
00:59:35,843 --> 00:59:37,977
Aren't you,
my little baby?

1006
00:59:38,044 --> 00:59:40,046
Aren't you, Brucey?
Yes.

1007
00:59:40,113 --> 00:59:42,014
I love you.

1008
00:59:43,516 --> 00:59:46,953
I never said that.
I love you both equally.

1009
00:59:47,019 --> 00:59:51,290
Who, that? It's Cass.

1010
00:59:53,893 --> 00:59:55,261
You're so pretty.

1011
00:59:57,096 --> 00:59:59,499
Who's this?

1012
00:59:59,565 --> 01:00:01,534
It's a beaver.

1013
01:00:01,601 --> 01:00:02,602
Hmm.

1014
01:00:05,104 --> 01:00:09,375
Does Brucey want a treat?
Does Brucey want a treat?

1015
01:00:11,277 --> 01:00:12,478
What's this?

1016
01:00:16,382 --> 01:00:18,518
It's art.
Don't touch.

1017
01:00:21,421 --> 01:00:23,824
He your
ex or something?

1018
01:00:23,891 --> 01:00:25,558
You don't know
who that is?

1019
01:00:26,959 --> 01:00:28,161
The Joker.

1020
01:00:28,227 --> 01:00:30,997
The Clown Prince of Crime?

1021
01:00:31,063 --> 01:00:32,665
My former partner
in madness?

1022
01:00:32,732 --> 01:00:35,201
The Harlequin of Hate?
The Jester of Genocide?

1023
01:00:35,268 --> 01:00:37,236
You've never heard of him?

1024
01:00:37,303 --> 01:00:39,539
Well, sounds like a dick.

1025
01:00:42,675 --> 01:00:43,676
Huh.

1026
01:00:53,753 --> 01:00:55,121
Milk.

1027
01:01:05,231 --> 01:01:09,235
<i>I'm not going soft or
nothing, but I gotta admit,</i>

1028
01:01:09,302 --> 01:01:11,704
<i>it was kinda nice
having the kid around.</i>

1029
01:01:22,482 --> 01:01:25,451
Give me a #32.
Mild.

1030
01:01:25,518 --> 01:01:27,487
Uh... Yeah, sure.

1031
01:01:48,741 --> 01:01:49,977
Who are you?

1032
01:01:50,042 --> 01:01:51,444
They call me...

1033
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:54,982
H...

1034
01:01:55,047 --> 01:01:56,716
<i>My bad.
I should've introduced you.</i>

1035
01:01:56,782 --> 01:01:58,251
<i>I'll make it quick.</i>

1036
01:02:02,288 --> 01:02:04,257
<i>Meet the daughter
of the richest,</i>

1037
01:02:04,323 --> 01:02:07,660
<i>most powerful Mafia don
in Gotham City.</i>

1038
01:02:07,727 --> 01:02:10,162
<i>Helena Bertinelli.</i>

1039
01:02:10,229 --> 01:02:12,732
<i>Yep, that Bertinelli.</i>

1040
01:02:14,433 --> 01:02:15,735
<i>One day,
she comes home to find</i>

1041
01:02:15,802 --> 01:02:18,437
<i>her whole family
in the living room.</i>

1042
01:02:18,504 --> 01:02:19,605
Momma.

1043
01:02:21,374 --> 01:02:25,745
<i>Anyone and everyone with
Bertinelli blood is there.</i>

1044
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:31,018
<i>Oh, and that?
That's Stefano Galante.</i>

1045
01:02:31,083 --> 01:02:32,451
<i>The guy
making the play for</i>

1046
01:02:32,518 --> 01:02:34,754
<i>the Bertinelli
turf and fortune.</i>

1047
01:02:58,511 --> 01:03:01,815
<i>When one of the goons
finds the kid alive,</i>

1048
01:03:01,882 --> 01:03:03,884
<i>the big softy
sneaks her outta there</i>

1049
01:03:03,951 --> 01:03:06,385
<i>and hides her away in Sicily.</i>

1050
01:03:06,452 --> 01:03:08,654
<i>Where she is raised
by his own</i>

1051
01:03:08,721 --> 01:03:11,858
<i>father and brother.
Both assassins.</i>

1052
01:03:19,198 --> 01:03:23,569
<i>She spends the next 15 years
thinking only of revenge.</i>

1053
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:26,172
<i>So, she starts training.</i>

1054
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,342
<i>When she was ready,</i>

1055
01:03:29,408 --> 01:03:30,743
<i>and by "ready" I mean</i>

1056
01:03:30,811 --> 01:03:32,813
<i>a badass motherfucking
killing machine,</i>

1057
01:03:36,449 --> 01:03:37,750
<i>she moves back
to Gotham.</i>

1058
01:03:37,818 --> 01:03:39,485
<i>Starts working
on that kill list.</i>

1059
01:03:47,961 --> 01:03:50,296
<i>She has the murder stuff
down, but the rest?</i>

1060
01:03:50,363 --> 01:03:51,464
Do you know who I am?

1061
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:53,967
Do you know who I am?

1062
01:03:54,034 --> 01:03:55,501
<i>Still a
work in progress.</i>

1063
01:03:58,105 --> 01:03:59,806
Do you know who I am?

1064
01:03:59,873 --> 01:04:01,273
The Crossbow Killer.

1065
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:02,675
They call me...

1066
01:04:02,742 --> 01:04:04,710
The Crossbow Killer.

1067
01:04:04,777 --> 01:04:06,278
They call me...

1068
01:04:06,345 --> 01:04:09,148
The Crossbow Killer?

1069
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:10,549
They call me...

1070
01:04:13,786 --> 01:04:14,888
Huntress.

1071
01:04:14,955 --> 01:04:17,423
<i>She calls herself Huntress.</i>

1072
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:20,393
<i>Fucking fabulous,
if you ask me.</i>

1073
01:04:20,459 --> 01:04:23,195
And who are you
looking for?

1074
01:04:29,368 --> 01:04:30,904
Great club.

1075
01:04:30,971 --> 01:04:32,538
Quinn got the girl.

1076
01:04:32,605 --> 01:04:33,606
And?

1077
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:35,842
And they disappeared.

1078
01:04:37,844 --> 01:04:39,712
Fuck!

1079
01:04:41,114 --> 01:04:42,348
Fuck!

1080
01:04:49,122 --> 01:04:50,690
What is she laughing at?

1081
01:04:52,491 --> 01:04:53,793
Is she laughing at me?

1082
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:55,261
She is.

1083
01:04:55,327 --> 01:04:57,097
No, she's not.
She's...

1084
01:04:57,164 --> 01:04:59,498
What are you laughing at,
Erika?

1085
01:04:59,565 --> 01:05:01,467
Roman, you gotta
hear this.

1086
01:05:01,534 --> 01:05:04,203
- It's hilarious.
- Get on the table.

1087
01:05:04,270 --> 01:05:05,504
- Oh.
- Ooh.

1088
01:05:05,571 --> 01:05:07,740
You're being a total kook.

1089
01:05:09,076 --> 01:05:11,011
Get on the fucking table.

1090
01:05:12,611 --> 01:05:16,183
This is my club.
Get up now.

1091
01:05:16,248 --> 01:05:17,683
- Okay.
- Now.

1092
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:21,654
Whoa.

1093
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:25,324
Now, dance.

1094
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:33,599
Dance.
Dance, Erika!

1095
01:05:33,666 --> 01:05:34,901
Okay.

1096
01:05:42,541 --> 01:05:45,244
This dress
is fucking hideous.

1097
01:05:46,913 --> 01:05:47,981
Take it off.

1098
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:51,517
Take your dress off.

1099
01:05:53,586 --> 01:05:55,755
Get up there and
fucking cut it off her.

1100
01:05:56,890 --> 01:05:59,059
Do it now!

1101
01:05:59,126 --> 01:06:01,360
Take her fucking dress off.

1102
01:06:01,427 --> 01:06:03,262
Just rip it off her.
Hurry up!

1103
01:06:03,329 --> 01:06:04,730
Hurry up!

1104
01:06:06,499 --> 01:06:08,168
- Fucking do it.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1105
01:06:08,235 --> 01:06:09,236
Do it.

1106
01:06:12,806 --> 01:06:15,641
Yeah. Beautiful.

1107
01:06:30,924 --> 01:06:33,626
You wouldn't betray me,
would you?

1108
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:37,931
I was just
gonna go look for the girl.

1109
01:06:37,998 --> 01:06:40,267
Oh, no, no, no.
I want you to stay here with me.

1110
01:06:40,332 --> 01:06:43,536
I want you to stay here
with me close.

1111
01:06:43,602 --> 01:06:46,072
You soothe me,
little bird.

1112
01:07:00,553 --> 01:07:01,754
Oh, good.
You got it.

1113
01:07:01,822 --> 01:07:03,355
Did you trace the messages?

1114
01:07:03,422 --> 01:07:05,658
You stole evidence
from an active crime scene,

1115
01:07:05,724 --> 01:07:07,093
and then had it
sent to my office.

1116
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:09,996
Renee, what were
you thinking?

1117
01:07:10,063 --> 01:07:13,099
Roman is the one that put
a price on the kid's head.

1118
01:07:13,166 --> 01:07:14,868
Okay? I had to.

1119
01:07:14,935 --> 01:07:16,303
I can't get into it
right now...

1120
01:07:16,368 --> 01:07:18,071
Renee, you need help.

1121
01:07:18,138 --> 01:07:20,173
What are you talking about?

1122
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,474
She's right.

1123
01:07:22,541 --> 01:07:26,079
You are a good cop, Montoya,
but you've lost your way.

1124
01:07:27,314 --> 01:07:28,714
What?

1125
01:07:28,781 --> 01:07:30,416
I'm sorry.
Okay?

1126
01:07:30,482 --> 01:07:32,319
You gave me no choice.

1127
01:07:32,384 --> 01:07:34,386
- Did you sell me out?
- I'm sorry.

1128
01:07:35,021 --> 01:07:36,522
You're suspended.

1129
01:07:37,523 --> 01:07:39,725
Your badge
and your gun, now.

1130
01:07:43,562 --> 01:07:47,100
<i>If you've ever
watched any cop movie ever,</i>

1131
01:07:47,167 --> 01:07:49,702
<i>you know that this is
when shit gets real.</i>

1132
01:07:49,768 --> 01:07:51,704
What's the point
of the badge,

1133
01:07:53,472 --> 01:07:55,608
when it means
fuck all anyway?

1134
01:07:57,610 --> 01:07:59,511
Right, Captain?

1135
01:07:59,578 --> 01:08:01,413
<i>No cop
ever gets anything done</i>

1136
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,682
<i>until after they've
been suspended.</i>

1137
01:08:05,852 --> 01:08:07,486
<i>Which would've
had me worried,</i>

1138
01:08:07,553 --> 01:08:10,623
<i>only I had
more pressing concerns.</i>

1139
01:08:10,689 --> 01:08:12,391
And that is why
you should never partake

1140
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:14,793
in paying
federal income taxes.

1141
01:08:14,861 --> 01:08:16,695
Hey,
you'll ruin your nails.

1142
01:08:20,066 --> 01:08:21,334
Thank you.

1143
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:23,370
Anyway, lesson 37.

1144
01:08:23,435 --> 01:08:24,838
Why...

1145
01:08:26,273 --> 01:08:27,640
You said
they wouldn't find us.

1146
01:08:27,706 --> 01:08:30,676
Chillax.
No one knows we're here.

1147
01:08:30,743 --> 01:08:33,579
Harleen Quinzel,
this is Gotham Police.

1148
01:08:33,646 --> 01:08:35,581
Okay.
So they know.

1149
01:08:35,648 --> 01:08:36,950
Let's scram.

1150
01:08:39,386 --> 01:08:40,854
Open the door.

1151
01:08:40,921 --> 01:08:43,089
Holy back door, Beavy.
This is getting outta hand.

1152
01:08:43,156 --> 01:08:44,391
Bruce, come here.

1153
01:08:44,456 --> 01:08:45,791
I can hear you!
Open the door.

1154
01:08:47,027 --> 01:08:48,028
What is that?

1155
01:08:49,229 --> 01:08:51,597
See you in hell, Harley!

1156
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,835
Get under the table!

1157
01:08:58,071 --> 01:09:00,073
Bruce? Bruce!

1158
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:01,174
Come here! No!

1159
01:09:11,918 --> 01:09:12,919
Bruce?

1160
01:09:14,821 --> 01:09:17,190
Come here, boy.
Bruce?

1161
01:09:20,193 --> 01:09:21,194
Bruce?

1162
01:09:22,929 --> 01:09:23,930
Bruce?

1163
01:09:25,731 --> 01:09:27,801
This doesn't make sense.

1164
01:09:27,867 --> 01:09:30,070
It doesn't make sense.
I don't understand.

1165
01:09:30,971 --> 01:09:32,471
No one knew
we were here.

1166
01:09:32,538 --> 01:09:34,074
No one knew we were
here, except...

1167
01:09:35,075 --> 01:09:36,142
Doc.

1168
01:09:36,209 --> 01:09:37,210
Oh, my God. Doc?

1169
01:09:39,312 --> 01:09:41,513
Doc? Where is he?

1170
01:09:42,983 --> 01:09:44,117
Doc?

1171
01:09:44,184 --> 01:09:48,021
I can't find Bruce.
I can't find him. I...

1172
01:09:54,593 --> 01:09:56,363
No.

1173
01:09:56,429 --> 01:09:58,530
I'm sorry, lotus flower.

1174
01:09:58,597 --> 01:10:00,333
You sold me out?

1175
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:03,569
Too many people offering
me too much money.

1176
01:10:05,005 --> 01:10:07,740
I have enough now to
open up a new restaurant.

1177
01:10:08,507 --> 01:10:09,876
A really nice one.

1178
01:10:09,943 --> 01:10:11,177
But, Doc,

1179
01:10:11,945 --> 01:10:13,746
it's me.

1180
01:10:13,813 --> 01:10:15,815
It's just business.

1181
01:10:42,641 --> 01:10:46,012
<i>This next
bit ain't very pretty.</i>

1182
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:49,149
- You're right.
- Harley?

1183
01:10:49,715 --> 01:10:50,984
He's right.

1184
01:10:53,253 --> 01:10:54,854
Business is business.

1185
01:10:55,754 --> 01:10:58,224
I've got the kid.

1186
01:10:58,291 --> 01:10:59,492
But I'm gonna need to

1187
01:10:59,558 --> 01:11:01,227
renegotiate
the terms of our deal.

1188
01:11:01,294 --> 01:11:02,862
If I hand her over,

1189
01:11:02,929 --> 01:11:05,398
I want everyone who's
after me to back off.

1190
01:11:05,465 --> 01:11:08,835
<i>Quinn,
bring me the rock now</i>

1191
01:11:08,902 --> 01:11:10,837
<i>and I guarantee
your safety.</i>

1192
01:11:10,904 --> 01:11:14,606
<i>I own this town.
You'll have my protection.</i>

1193
01:11:14,673 --> 01:11:16,342
Fine.

1194
01:11:16,409 --> 01:11:20,679
Meet me at Amusement Mile.
The Booby Trap. In one hour.

1195
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:31,491
Quit judging.

1196
01:11:34,693 --> 01:11:35,895
Zsasz!

1197
01:11:42,601 --> 01:11:44,437
Come on, kid.

1198
01:11:44,504 --> 01:11:46,439
Let's get you
somewhere safe.

1199
01:11:46,506 --> 01:11:47,639
We got them.

1200
01:11:51,578 --> 01:11:53,313
Little bird!

1201
01:11:53,379 --> 01:11:56,748
You're gonna be
driving Mr. Zsasz tonight.

1202
01:11:56,816 --> 01:12:01,020
Go. Fetch. Amusement Mile.
The Booby Trap.

1203
01:12:01,087 --> 01:12:03,423
Do we have
to bring them back?

1204
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:06,960
I think you can manage
a couple of little girls.

1205
01:12:08,094 --> 01:12:10,696
Just bring me back
my diamond.

1206
01:12:57,210 --> 01:12:58,211
What is it?

1207
01:12:59,579 --> 01:13:00,779
Nothing.

1208
01:13:13,759 --> 01:13:15,261
Pull over.

1209
01:13:15,328 --> 01:13:16,529
What?

1210
01:13:16,596 --> 01:13:19,265
Pull the fucking car
over now.

1211
01:13:21,601 --> 01:13:23,469
I gotta take a leak.

1212
01:13:26,472 --> 01:13:29,542
<i>She betrayed you, boss.
She betrayed you.</i>

1213
01:13:29,609 --> 01:13:31,010
Are you sure?

1214
01:13:31,077 --> 01:13:34,013
<i>Your little bird's
a fucking rat.</i>

1215
01:13:41,221 --> 01:13:43,223
<i>You want me
to kill her?</i>

1216
01:13:46,559 --> 01:13:47,627
No.

1217
01:13:47,694 --> 01:13:49,896
No. No.

1218
01:13:49,963 --> 01:13:51,898
I'll come to you.

1219
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:30,136
I thought we were friends.
And you...

1220
01:14:30,203 --> 01:14:31,871
You saw what it's
like for me out there.

1221
01:14:31,938 --> 01:14:33,606
I didn't have a choice.

1222
01:14:33,673 --> 01:14:36,909
And if you go before he gets
here, everything will be fine.

1223
01:14:38,711 --> 01:14:40,246
Harley.

1224
01:14:40,313 --> 01:14:43,049
I'm sorry, kid. I am.

1225
01:14:53,293 --> 01:14:54,494
That was fast.

1226
01:14:57,730 --> 01:14:59,399
She's in...

1227
01:14:59,465 --> 01:15:00,933
Where's Cassandra Cain?

1228
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,469
You? Again?

1229
01:15:12,745 --> 01:15:13,813
Are you drunk?

1230
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:15,481
Come on.

1231
01:15:15,548 --> 01:15:16,549
Okay.

1232
01:15:38,938 --> 01:15:40,306
Right in the tit.

1233
01:15:46,245 --> 01:15:48,381
Where's Cassandra Cain?

1234
01:15:49,549 --> 01:15:50,550
Cass.

1235
01:15:57,223 --> 01:15:59,992
You killed my sandwich!

1236
01:16:07,066 --> 01:16:08,468
Bye-bye, birdie.

1237
01:16:09,936 --> 01:16:11,137
Ow!

1238
01:16:12,872 --> 01:16:14,607
No fair.

1239
01:16:14,674 --> 01:16:16,342
Was that really necessary?

1240
01:16:16,409 --> 01:16:18,344
You don't know her
like I do.

1241
01:16:18,911 --> 01:16:20,113
Cass?

1242
01:16:24,016 --> 01:16:25,485
Oh, thank God.

1243
01:16:26,419 --> 01:16:27,754
I'm gonna get you
outta here.

1244
01:16:27,821 --> 01:16:29,122
Did she really tape you

1245
01:16:29,188 --> 01:16:30,990
- to a damn toilet?
- Mmm-hmm.

1246
01:16:32,658 --> 01:16:33,726
Hmm.

1247
01:16:33,793 --> 01:16:35,361
This is nice.

1248
01:16:36,195 --> 01:16:38,030
You're still conscious.

1249
01:16:40,133 --> 01:16:41,467
You can still feel?

1250
01:16:41,534 --> 01:16:44,637
Look at me.
Are you a good girl, now?

1251
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:50,543
"I'm a good girl.
I'm a good girl."

1252
01:17:01,687 --> 01:17:03,055
I got one

1253
01:17:03,891 --> 01:17:05,224
for all the little birds

1254
01:17:05,291 --> 01:17:09,061
I helped fly away
from this world.

1255
01:17:09,128 --> 01:17:11,964
I'm saving
a special spot for you.

1256
01:17:13,166 --> 01:17:14,634
Right here.

1257
01:17:19,772 --> 01:17:20,773
You're gonna
have to be quiet.

1258
01:17:20,841 --> 01:17:22,008
- Ow!
- Hi.

1259
01:17:22,074 --> 01:17:23,543
What are you guys doing?

1260
01:17:27,513 --> 01:17:30,450
Oh, I know
where the diamond is.

1261
01:17:30,516 --> 01:17:33,686
Is that rock
still inside you?

1262
01:17:36,722 --> 01:17:38,324
Oh, God.

1263
01:17:41,427 --> 01:17:42,462
Stop.

1264
01:17:44,730 --> 01:17:46,098
The hell, Zsasz?

1265
01:17:46,867 --> 01:17:48,034
Cut her open.

1266
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:49,535
Stop fucking around.

1267
01:17:49,602 --> 01:17:50,970
You heard me.

1268
01:17:51,037 --> 01:17:53,339
Cut her fucking open.

1269
01:17:53,406 --> 01:17:56,409
Okay. No, no. No, no, no.
See, she's just a kid.

1270
01:17:56,476 --> 01:17:58,846
You're a filthy
fucking rat.

1271
01:17:58,912 --> 01:18:00,446
I'm a rat?

1272
01:18:00,513 --> 01:18:04,083
I knew you couldn't be trusted.
Roman's little bird.

1273
01:18:04,150 --> 01:18:06,552
You little fucking bird.

1274
01:18:06,619 --> 01:18:09,288
That's why he needs me
to look out for him.

1275
01:18:11,123 --> 01:18:14,260
That's why he needs me
to take care of him.

1276
01:18:15,829 --> 01:18:18,899
You know you're just
being paranoid, Zsasz.

1277
01:18:18,966 --> 01:18:20,199
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

1278
01:18:20,266 --> 01:18:21,567
Prove it to me.

1279
01:18:22,836 --> 01:18:25,137
Rip open
her little tummy.

1280
01:18:25,204 --> 01:18:26,706
Yeah,
that's not gonna happen.

1281
01:18:26,772 --> 01:18:29,108
Now! Rip it open!

1282
01:18:42,755 --> 01:18:44,724
You piece of shit!

1283
01:18:53,032 --> 01:18:54,233
Freeze!

1284
01:18:58,104 --> 01:18:59,539
Don't fucking move.

1285
01:19:01,942 --> 01:19:03,576
Who the fuck are you?

1286
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:11,818
Go get the kid.

1287
01:19:11,885 --> 01:19:13,386
All right.

1288
01:19:13,452 --> 01:19:15,221
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Back the fuck up!

1289
01:19:15,288 --> 01:19:17,891
- Get away from me. All of you.
- Put that shit down.

1290
01:19:17,958 --> 01:19:19,993
Shoot them, kid.

1291
01:19:20,059 --> 01:19:23,931
You, put that stupid-ass
Robin Hood piece of shit down!

1292
01:19:23,997 --> 01:19:27,066
- Cass, it's okay. Just calm...
- Don't move!

1293
01:19:27,133 --> 01:19:28,802
Okay.

1294
01:19:28,869 --> 01:19:31,170
I don't know what
the fuck is going on.

1295
01:19:31,237 --> 01:19:32,772
But I know
that this shit stick...

1296
01:19:34,407 --> 01:19:36,409
...just tried to gut me.

1297
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:38,411
And you.

1298
01:19:40,513 --> 01:19:42,315
Thought you were different.

1299
01:19:45,084 --> 01:19:46,485
I'm sorry, kid.

1300
01:19:48,822 --> 01:19:51,591
I'm just a terrible person,
I guess.

1301
01:19:58,564 --> 01:19:59,565
Ooh!

1302
01:20:00,299 --> 01:20:01,634
Ooh, I'm back.

1303
01:20:01,701 --> 01:20:03,603
Okay, I feel like
I've just walked in on

1304
01:20:03,669 --> 01:20:05,171
something I don't
give two shits about.

1305
01:20:05,237 --> 01:20:06,405
This guy's dead,
so I'm just

1306
01:20:06,472 --> 01:20:07,908
gonna get outta your hair. Cool?

1307
01:20:07,975 --> 01:20:10,576
No. Wait. She's lying.
She works for Sionis.

1308
01:20:10,643 --> 01:20:12,778
Excuse me?
I work for Sionis?

1309
01:20:14,347 --> 01:20:17,084
I'm not letting you
sell the kid to him.

1310
01:20:17,149 --> 01:20:18,517
I wasn't going
to sell the kid.

1311
01:20:18,584 --> 01:20:20,219
I was going
to trade the kid.

1312
01:20:20,286 --> 01:20:22,089
Yeah. To save your own stupid skin.
Huh?

1313
01:20:22,154 --> 01:20:23,322
I'm not proud
of what I did,

1314
01:20:23,389 --> 01:20:25,157
but I had
half the city after me.

1315
01:20:25,224 --> 01:20:27,126
Even the fucking
Crossbow Killer.

1316
01:20:27,193 --> 01:20:28,929
I'm not
the Crossbow Killer!

1317
01:20:28,996 --> 01:20:30,196
Whoa.

1318
01:20:31,932 --> 01:20:33,033
They call me...

1319
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:34,667
Helena Bertinelli.

1320
01:20:34,734 --> 01:20:35,601
For fuck's sake.

1321
01:20:35,668 --> 01:20:37,737
As in
the Bertinelli massacre?

1322
01:20:37,804 --> 01:20:41,808
Sheesh kebab.
That is childhood trauma, right there.

1323
01:20:47,513 --> 01:20:49,582
<i>I killed Galante.</i>

1324
01:20:53,352 --> 01:20:55,022
I killed his firing squad.

1325
01:20:59,993 --> 01:21:02,595
<i>I killed Victor Zsasz.</i>

1326
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:09,803
And now I'm done.

1327
01:21:11,637 --> 01:21:12,738
Bravo.

1328
01:21:17,777 --> 01:21:19,545
So if you don't mind,
I'm gonna leave now.

1329
01:21:19,612 --> 01:21:21,948
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

1330
01:21:22,015 --> 01:21:23,449
I hate to be the one
to break it to you,

1331
01:21:23,516 --> 01:21:25,852
sweetheart,
but you are not done.

1332
01:21:25,919 --> 01:21:26,987
Who do you think funded

1333
01:21:27,054 --> 01:21:28,621
Galante's little
power grab, huh?

1334
01:21:28,688 --> 01:21:30,456
Galante was
working with Sionis.

1335
01:21:30,523 --> 01:21:32,826
Roman killed your whole
family looking for that rock.

1336
01:21:32,893 --> 01:21:35,761
You don't think
he's gonna kill this kid?

1337
01:21:35,829 --> 01:21:38,464
That diamond is our only
chance of stopping him.

1338
01:21:38,531 --> 01:21:39,699
You guys.

1339
01:21:39,765 --> 01:21:42,334
Hey, I think
you should see this.

1340
01:21:44,838 --> 01:21:45,872
Oh.

1341
01:21:45,939 --> 01:21:47,606
It's Sionis.

1342
01:21:59,953 --> 01:22:02,155
We're fucked.

1343
01:22:02,221 --> 01:22:04,290
He bought himself an army.

1344
01:22:12,966 --> 01:22:13,967
They're all here for me.

1345
01:22:16,136 --> 01:22:17,670
Aren't they?

1346
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:26,079
- No.
- They're not?

1347
01:22:26,146 --> 01:22:28,347
No, they're not.

1348
01:22:28,414 --> 01:22:29,950
Do you know
what that means?

1349
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:31,550
That means he's not just
after the kid anymore.

1350
01:22:31,617 --> 01:22:33,053
He's after all of us.

1351
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,956
He's sure as hell after me.
I just robbed him.

1352
01:22:36,022 --> 01:22:39,258
You just betrayed him.
You just killed his BFF.

1353
01:22:39,325 --> 01:22:40,693
And you're dumb enough

1354
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:42,795
to be building
a case against him.

1355
01:22:42,863 --> 01:22:45,598
So, unless we all wanna
die very unpleasant deaths

1356
01:22:45,664 --> 01:22:47,366
and let Roman
go finger-fishing

1357
01:22:47,433 --> 01:22:49,035
in the kid's intestinal tract,

1358
01:22:50,536 --> 01:22:51,972
we're gonna have
to work together.

1359
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:54,607
With you?

1360
01:22:54,673 --> 01:22:55,909
Yeah.

1361
01:22:55,976 --> 01:22:57,476
We're gonna work together,

1362
01:22:57,543 --> 01:22:59,012
and we'll get outta here
in one piece, okay?

1363
01:23:03,216 --> 01:23:04,517
Okay.

1364
01:23:05,451 --> 01:23:07,888
Yeah. Okay.

1365
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:11,925
Sure.

1366
01:23:11,992 --> 01:23:13,359
Yes!

1367
01:23:13,425 --> 01:23:15,728
But we are gonna need
some serious hardware.

1368
01:23:15,795 --> 01:23:16,796
Mmm-hmm.

1369
01:23:20,533 --> 01:23:23,335
Will this do?

1370
01:23:24,805 --> 01:23:25,771
No.

1371
01:23:25,839 --> 01:23:27,640
Not at all.

1372
01:23:29,810 --> 01:23:31,544
We're dead.
We're fucking dead.

1373
01:23:31,610 --> 01:23:33,880
That slimy jizznozzle!
I can't believe

1374
01:23:33,947 --> 01:23:35,816
- he took it all!
- We're fucked.

1375
01:23:35,882 --> 01:23:38,417
- Fuck!
- Uh, there's this.

1376
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:45,826
Okay.

1377
01:23:57,204 --> 01:24:01,975
Friends,
brothers, men of Gotham.

1378
01:24:03,043 --> 01:24:07,713
I have funded you.
I've protected you.

1379
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:11,750
I've scratched your backs
and kept you outta jail.

1380
01:24:11,818 --> 01:24:14,553
Well, now it's time
to say thank you.

1381
01:24:15,788 --> 01:24:17,858
Go show those little bitches

1382
01:24:17,924 --> 01:24:21,727
you don't mess
with Roman Sionis.

1383
01:24:21,794 --> 01:24:25,332
Half a mil to whoever
brings me the girl alive.

1384
01:24:25,397 --> 01:24:27,633
The rest you can kill.

1385
01:24:33,739 --> 01:24:34,740
Dope.

1386
01:24:36,542 --> 01:24:38,178
Oh, no, no, no.
Not that one.

1387
01:24:38,245 --> 01:24:40,446
Sentimental value.
Try this.

1388
01:24:42,514 --> 01:24:43,884
You're kidding.

1389
01:24:43,950 --> 01:24:45,651
What?
Gotta take care of the girls.

1390
01:24:45,718 --> 01:24:47,486
Isn't this fun?
It's just like a sleepover.

1391
01:24:47,553 --> 01:24:49,823
We should order pizza.
Make cosmos.

1392
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:51,992
- Harley, focus. Yeah.
- Okay.

1393
01:24:53,293 --> 01:24:54,660
Hey, nice.
What the hell is up

1394
01:24:54,727 --> 01:24:55,929
with this bow
and arrow shtick?

1395
01:24:55,996 --> 01:24:57,463
It's not a fucking
bow and arrow.

1396
01:24:57,529 --> 01:24:58,999
It's a crossbow.
I'm not 12.

1397
01:24:59,065 --> 01:25:00,799
I love this chick.
She's got rage issues.

1398
01:25:00,867 --> 01:25:02,534
I don't have rage issues.

1399
01:25:02,601 --> 01:25:05,205
You know,
psychologically speaking,

1400
01:25:05,272 --> 01:25:08,041
vengeance rarely brings
the catharsis we hope for.

1401
01:25:08,108 --> 01:25:09,376
Yeah.

1402
01:25:09,441 --> 01:25:11,912
Are we ready?
Bad guys, just outside.

1403
01:25:16,249 --> 01:25:17,516
Shit. Get down.

1404
01:25:19,319 --> 01:25:20,653
Down here!

1405
01:25:22,355 --> 01:25:23,622
Cass!

1406
01:25:23,689 --> 01:25:25,691
- Follow me!
- Go, go, go, go!

1407
01:25:25,758 --> 01:25:27,227
Go!

1408
01:25:31,563 --> 01:25:33,099
Holy shit!

1409
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:55,422
What?

1410
01:25:55,487 --> 01:25:57,556
You are so cool.

1411
01:25:57,623 --> 01:25:59,259
Okay. This way.

1412
01:26:08,068 --> 01:26:09,436
Get ready, ladies.

1413
01:26:20,146 --> 01:26:21,414
Don't worry.
You're gonna make it.

1414
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:22,949
Okay? Okay.

1415
01:26:23,016 --> 01:26:25,751
What the...
Go! Go, go, go!

1416
01:26:26,453 --> 01:26:27,653
Fuck.

1417
01:26:29,788 --> 01:26:30,991
Shit.

1418
01:26:40,967 --> 01:26:42,235
Whoa. Shit!

1419
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:02,989
Motherfucker.

1420
01:27:16,302 --> 01:27:18,338
Let me go!

1421
01:27:18,405 --> 01:27:20,006
Gotcha.

1422
01:27:21,174 --> 01:27:22,208
This way!

1423
01:27:22,275 --> 01:27:23,810
Come on. Come on.
It's okay. Come on.

1424
01:27:23,877 --> 01:27:25,879
You shouldn't
have to see this.

1425
01:27:25,945 --> 01:27:27,713
Here, hold on to this
for me, okay?

1426
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:29,082
That's all you think about.

1427
01:27:29,149 --> 01:27:30,450
Just close your eyes
and hold it tight. Okay?

1428
01:27:32,018 --> 01:27:33,987
Here. Get down. Come on.
You'll be safe.

1429
01:28:16,162 --> 01:28:17,163
Canary!

1430
01:28:18,664 --> 01:28:20,567
You okay?

1431
01:28:20,632 --> 01:28:22,235
We gotta go this way!

1432
01:28:24,571 --> 01:28:26,139
Ugh. More?

1433
01:28:26,206 --> 01:28:28,141
When the fuck did she have
time to do a shoe change?

1434
01:28:28,208 --> 01:28:29,342
Come on.

1435
01:28:36,382 --> 01:28:37,383
Thanks.

1436
01:28:50,864 --> 01:28:52,065
Duck!

1437
01:28:56,369 --> 01:28:57,703
- Hair tie?
- Yeah.

1438
01:28:58,605 --> 01:28:59,671
Ah, fuck!

1439
01:29:04,776 --> 01:29:06,045
I got him!

1440
01:29:09,516 --> 01:29:10,817
Get back here, kid!

1441
01:29:14,621 --> 01:29:16,022
Who's got the kid?

1442
01:29:28,667 --> 01:29:29,869
Get down!

1443
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:42,982
Please, no more.

1444
01:29:47,654 --> 01:29:49,088
So, forgive me yet?

1445
01:29:49,155 --> 01:29:50,223
Get off me.

1446
01:29:54,928 --> 01:29:57,230
Anyone else hungry?
I know a great taco spot.

1447
01:29:57,297 --> 01:29:58,631
- I'm starving.
- I love tacos.

1448
01:29:58,697 --> 01:29:59,999
Really?

1449
01:30:08,208 --> 01:30:09,943
Down! Get down!

1450
01:30:10,009 --> 01:30:11,578
You're okay.
You're okay.

1451
01:30:11,644 --> 01:30:14,247
Just breathe. Just breathe.
Let me check it.

1452
01:30:16,715 --> 01:30:17,951
Get off!

1453
01:30:18,017 --> 01:30:19,385
I got you.

1454
01:30:19,452 --> 01:30:21,087
Ooh!

1455
01:30:21,154 --> 01:30:23,656
Aren't you glad you wore that?
Sexy and bulletproof.

1456
01:30:23,722 --> 01:30:26,626
Harley! No!
Get off me!

1457
01:30:26,693 --> 01:30:27,759
Harley!

1458
01:30:27,827 --> 01:30:29,395
They got the kid.
Shit!

1459
01:30:29,462 --> 01:30:33,900
We can't let them get her.
I trust you.

1460
01:30:33,967 --> 01:30:35,802
- One bullet?
- Please help me!

1461
01:30:35,868 --> 01:30:37,370
Has anyone
got any bullets?

1462
01:30:37,437 --> 01:30:39,606
Fuck. I'm out.

1463
01:30:39,672 --> 01:30:42,809
I can't get out there.
I just need to get through.

1464
01:30:42,875 --> 01:30:44,776
- We gotta go. We gotta move.
- Shit.

1465
01:30:44,844 --> 01:30:46,512
Guys, they're in the car.

1466
01:30:46,579 --> 01:30:48,481
They're getting away.

1467
01:30:48,548 --> 01:30:50,083
- Get in there!
- Get off!

1468
01:30:52,518 --> 01:30:54,420
Shit! I'm out.

1469
01:30:54,487 --> 01:30:56,189
Guys, come on.
They're closing in.

1470
01:30:57,724 --> 01:31:00,994
Canary, you know
what you have to do!

1471
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:03,997
Cover your ears!
You better get her back.

1472
01:31:24,017 --> 01:31:26,319
<i>Told ya she had
a killer voice.</i>

1473
01:31:47,674 --> 01:31:48,875
Need a ride?

1474
01:32:14,701 --> 01:32:15,902
Get her!

1475
01:32:46,834 --> 01:32:48,634
Oh!

1476
01:32:59,412 --> 01:33:00,513
Whip me!

1477
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:01,614
What?

1478
01:33:01,681 --> 01:33:03,049
- Whip me!
- Okay.

1479
01:33:10,890 --> 01:33:12,091
Kid!

1480
01:33:12,658 --> 01:33:13,659
Harley!

1481
01:33:14,794 --> 01:33:15,995
Shoot her!

1482
01:33:24,470 --> 01:33:25,738
Harley!

1483
01:33:25,806 --> 01:33:27,306
Hit the brakes!

1484
01:33:46,959 --> 01:33:48,327
No!

1485
01:34:01,707 --> 01:34:02,708
Uh-oh.

1486
01:34:29,735 --> 01:34:31,037
Kid!

1487
01:34:42,982 --> 01:34:44,417
Harley!

1488
01:35:02,201 --> 01:35:03,769
Well,
we always did share

1489
01:35:03,837 --> 01:35:05,171
a love of the dramatic.

1490
01:35:05,238 --> 01:35:06,439
Didn't we?

1491
01:35:08,774 --> 01:35:10,443
And look at us now.

1492
01:35:11,777 --> 01:35:14,380
But don't you see?
You're trying to kill me.

1493
01:35:14,447 --> 01:35:17,083
I'm the only one
who can protect you!

1494
01:35:19,685 --> 01:35:22,154
You know you can't
stand on your own, Quinn.

1495
01:35:22,221 --> 01:35:23,589
You're not the type!

1496
01:35:24,925 --> 01:35:28,160
But me?
You need me!

1497
01:35:42,408 --> 01:35:45,511
Here's the thing,
Romy baby.

1498
01:35:47,413 --> 01:35:49,549
Your protection is
based on the fact

1499
01:35:49,615 --> 01:35:51,852
that people
are scared of you.

1500
01:35:51,919 --> 01:35:53,820
Just like
they're scared of Mr. J.

1501
01:35:59,292 --> 01:36:02,061
But I'm the one
they should be scared of.

1502
01:36:02,128 --> 01:36:04,564
Not you, and not Mr. J.

1503
01:36:04,630 --> 01:36:08,035
'Cause
I'm Harley fucking Quinn.

1504
01:36:15,374 --> 01:36:16,642
Shit.

1505
01:36:18,177 --> 01:36:19,947
That was super embarrassing.

1506
01:36:20,013 --> 01:36:21,581
Hmm. Sure was.

1507
01:36:21,647 --> 01:36:25,451
You think you can beat me?
You're a fucking moron.

1508
01:36:26,987 --> 01:36:29,188
I'm sorry, kid.

1509
01:36:29,255 --> 01:36:30,924
And I'm sorry
I tried to sell you.

1510
01:36:30,991 --> 01:36:32,692
That was a dick move.

1511
01:36:34,293 --> 01:36:36,930
For what it's worth,

1512
01:36:36,997 --> 01:36:40,633
you made me want to be
a less terrible person.

1513
01:36:41,767 --> 01:36:43,169
Ew.

1514
01:36:43,235 --> 01:36:46,238
If we're apologizing for shit,
I should tell you something.

1515
01:36:46,305 --> 01:36:47,607
Excuse me!

1516
01:36:47,673 --> 01:36:50,209
I stole something from you.

1517
01:36:50,276 --> 01:36:52,278
You slippery-fingered
little turd.

1518
01:36:52,345 --> 01:36:53,947
I took your ring.

1519
01:36:54,014 --> 01:36:55,348
My ring?

1520
01:36:58,018 --> 01:36:59,218
Dope.

1521
01:37:19,171 --> 01:37:21,074
Cass! Harley!

1522
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:22,575
We're okay.

1523
01:37:26,212 --> 01:37:27,747
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1524
01:37:28,547 --> 01:37:30,449
- He's gone?
- Mmm-hmm.

1525
01:37:30,516 --> 01:37:32,652
Good. Fuck that guy.

1526
01:37:32,718 --> 01:37:34,487
Yeah. Tacos?

1527
01:37:35,655 --> 01:37:37,057
No, but seriously.

1528
01:37:37,124 --> 01:37:38,992
You were very impressive
with that bow.

1529
01:37:39,059 --> 01:37:40,192
Very impressive.

1530
01:37:40,259 --> 01:37:41,494
It's a crossbow.

1531
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:42,863
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

1532
01:37:42,929 --> 01:37:44,363
- Mmm-hmm.
- Morning margaritas!

1533
01:37:44,430 --> 01:37:45,564
Thank you. I got you.

1534
01:37:45,631 --> 01:37:46,766
- You drink, right, kid?
- Yeah.

1535
01:37:46,833 --> 01:37:48,334
I don't think so.

1536
01:37:48,401 --> 01:37:50,436
And I love that fucking
name, Huntress.

1537
01:37:50,503 --> 01:37:52,039
- Really?
- Yeah.

1538
01:37:52,105 --> 01:37:53,572
Oh, great name.

1539
01:37:53,639 --> 01:37:54,674
Wow.

1540
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:57,343
Um... I really like
how you were able

1541
01:37:57,410 --> 01:37:59,512
to kick so high
in those tight pants.

1542
01:37:59,578 --> 01:38:01,114
- Yeah, that is cool.
- Yeah.

1543
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:02,949
- Thanks.
- Oh, um...

1544
01:38:03,016 --> 01:38:05,451
Thanks for the car.

1545
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:08,487
You're welcome.

1546
01:38:08,554 --> 01:38:10,489
Kid, if that burrito
doesn't make you shit,

1547
01:38:10,556 --> 01:38:12,591
I don't know what will.

1548
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:15,394
Give me a minute.

1549
01:38:17,164 --> 01:38:18,364
Yes!

1550
01:38:18,431 --> 01:38:20,934
Right.

1551
01:38:22,435 --> 01:38:23,904
I've given her prune
juice, laxatives.

1552
01:38:23,970 --> 01:38:26,272
I mean, the kid's got
a stomach made of steel.

1553
01:38:26,338 --> 01:38:28,607
And you know what?
I owe you an apology.

1554
01:38:29,208 --> 01:38:30,811
Me?

1555
01:38:30,877 --> 01:38:34,413
I underestimated you.
And I'm sorry.

1556
01:38:35,748 --> 01:38:37,750
I'm used to it.

1557
01:38:37,818 --> 01:38:41,220
Uh, Harley!
Bring the colander.

1558
01:38:42,823 --> 01:38:43,924
Ladies.

1559
01:38:43,990 --> 01:38:45,658
Have fun with that.

1560
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:49,528
So, what now?

1561
01:38:49,595 --> 01:38:50,897
Sionis is gone,
but it's just

1562
01:38:50,964 --> 01:38:53,066
a matter of time
before some other asshole

1563
01:38:53,133 --> 01:38:54,533
tries to finish
what he started.

1564
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:55,701
Right.

1565
01:38:55,768 --> 01:38:59,139
We gotta clean this city
from the inside out.

1566
01:38:59,206 --> 01:39:01,540
Does she always talk like
the cop in a bad '80s movie,

1567
01:39:01,607 --> 01:39:03,043
or is that just me?

1568
01:39:03,110 --> 01:39:04,211
Fuck you.
And fuck you.

1569
01:39:04,276 --> 01:39:05,611
What?

1570
01:39:05,678 --> 01:39:07,814
I mean,
we were amazing there.

1571
01:39:07,881 --> 01:39:09,182
Yeah! Hell yeah!

1572
01:39:09,248 --> 01:39:12,718
I agree completely.
So I'll do that, as well.

1573
01:39:12,785 --> 01:39:13,686
Thank you.

1574
01:39:13,753 --> 01:39:14,955
Right.

1575
01:39:15,021 --> 01:39:16,022
Whoa. Whoa, whoa!

1576
01:39:18,892 --> 01:39:20,026
She stole my fucking car!

1577
01:39:20,093 --> 01:39:21,161
What?

1578
01:39:25,232 --> 01:39:26,599
I'm sorry.

1579
01:39:26,665 --> 01:39:28,235
<i>I know
what you're thinking.</i>

1580
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:30,203
You think I'm a dick
after all that.

1581
01:39:30,269 --> 01:39:33,907
But you heard what the cop said.
Sionis is gone.

1582
01:39:33,974 --> 01:39:39,745
And those guys?
They're gonna be just fine.

1583
01:39:39,813 --> 01:39:41,280
<i>Montoya's boss picked up</i>

1584
01:39:41,347 --> 01:39:43,116
<i>the gangbangers
at the Booby Trap.</i>

1585
01:39:43,183 --> 01:39:46,585
<i>And took all the credit
while he was at it.</i>

1586
01:39:46,652 --> 01:39:47,686
<i>Again.</i>

1587
01:39:53,193 --> 01:39:54,895
<i>It was the kick in
the balls she needed</i>

1588
01:39:54,961 --> 01:39:56,796
<i>to see that she had
nothing to prove</i>

1589
01:39:56,863 --> 01:39:59,431
<i>to those blowhard assholes.</i>

1590
01:39:59,498 --> 01:40:02,068
<i>She quit the same day.</i>

1591
01:40:06,338 --> 01:40:08,674
<i>We got the secret bank codes
off the diamond.</i>

1592
01:40:08,741 --> 01:40:11,343
<i>And Huntress
got her family money back.</i>

1593
01:40:12,478 --> 01:40:13,679
<i>She's using it to fund</i>

1594
01:40:13,746 --> 01:40:15,481
<i>a little
crime-fighting outfit.</i>

1595
01:40:18,185 --> 01:40:22,488
<i>They call themselves
the Birds of Prey.</i>

1596
01:40:22,555 --> 01:40:25,524
<i>I call them
dorky little do-gooders.</i>

1597
01:40:27,894 --> 01:40:31,031
<i>The rock itself was worth
a chunk of change,</i>

1598
01:40:31,097 --> 01:40:32,531
<i>so I pawned it.</i>

1599
01:40:32,598 --> 01:40:34,366
<i>And I invested the cash
in a little startup</i>

1600
01:40:34,433 --> 01:40:36,036
<i>making waves
in the East End.</i>

1601
01:40:40,140 --> 01:40:41,875
<i>Oh! And I found Bruce.</i>

1602
01:40:41,942 --> 01:40:44,443
<i>He was wandering
around Chinatown.</i>

1603
01:40:44,510 --> 01:40:45,912
<i>I guess it proves the theory</i>

1604
01:40:45,979 --> 01:40:48,514
<i>that hyenas
really do have nine lives.</i>

1605
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:12,339
<i>Yeah, yeah.
I made the kid my apprentice.</i>

1606
01:41:12,404 --> 01:41:14,140
<i>Call me a softy.</i>

1607
01:41:15,407 --> 01:41:16,675
I dare ya.

1608
01:41:21,214 --> 01:41:22,581
Mmm!

1609
01:48:40,620 --> 01:48:43,122
<i>Are you dummies
still sitting there?</i>

1610
01:48:43,189 --> 01:48:45,191
<i>Fine. Since you
stuck it out this long,</i>

1611
01:48:45,258 --> 01:48:47,493
<i>I'll tell you
a super-duper secret secret.</i>

1612
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:49,228
<i>But you can't
tell anyone.</i>

1613
01:48:49,295 --> 01:48:51,798
<i>Okay.
Did you know that Batman...</i>

1614
