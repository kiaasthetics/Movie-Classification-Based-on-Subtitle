1
00:01:04,945 --> 00:01:07,545
Ladies and gentlemen,
this final round match will be

2
00:01:07,546 --> 00:01:10,681
the best of
three tie-break sets.

3
00:01:10,682 --> 00:01:13,234
To the right of my chair,
we have Patrick Zweig.

4
00:01:13,235 --> 00:01:15,787
Yes, Patrick!

5
00:01:16,797 --> 00:01:18,157
To the left of my chair,

6
00:01:18,158 --> 00:01:20,324
we have Art Donaldson.

7
00:01:27,472 --> 00:01:30,472
Donaldson won the toss
and has elected to serve.

8
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,976
First set.

9
00:01:37,747 --> 00:01:40,185
- All right!
- All right, let's bring it!

10
00:01:40,186 --> 00:01:42,225
Hey, we love you, Art!

11
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:49,722
Donaldson to serve.

12
00:01:57,999 --> 00:01:59,930
Ready? Play.

13
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,050
Out!

14
00:02:17,051 --> 00:02:18,619
Fifteen, love.

15
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:22,524
That's our boy.
Go, go.

16
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:33,502
Fifteen all.

17
00:03:09,476 --> 00:03:11,335
Let's go!

18
00:03:11,336 --> 00:03:12,508
Fifteen, 30.

19
00:04:43,064 --> 00:04:44,064
Let's go.

20
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:59,083
<i>Every premiere event and the...</i>

21
00:04:59,084 --> 00:05:00,999
Man,
that ankle's jammed.

22
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,915
I'll just stretch it
from here.

23
00:05:04,418 --> 00:05:06,381
Good. Nice and relaxed.

24
00:05:06,382 --> 00:05:09,119
All right, put a little pressure back
and I want you to inhale.

25
00:05:11,596 --> 00:05:12,990
<i>Okay,
let's check out today's</i>

26
00:05:12,991 --> 00:05:15,766
<i>first round matchups.
Mary Jo, let's be honest...</i>

27
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:17,392
Again.

28
00:05:17,393 --> 00:05:18,566
<i>I mean, it's safe to say that
Donaldson is a huge favorite</i>

29
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:20,600
<i>against the French teen,
Du Maurier.</i>

30
00:05:20,601 --> 00:05:22,219
<i>Well, on paper, he is.</i>

31
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,838
<i>But because
he had surgery last year...</i>

32
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,773
Bryan, we have the practice court
booked at 8:00,

33
00:05:25,774 --> 00:05:27,739
so we should probably head out
in about 15 minutes.

34
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,504
Yep,
he'll be ready by then.

35
00:05:29,505 --> 00:05:31,314
<i>In your first two-fifty,
as a qualifier...</i>

36
00:05:31,315 --> 00:05:32,646
- Hey, Art? Just relax.
- Lily,

37
00:05:32,647 --> 00:05:33,745
you have to have some fruit
with your breakfast.

38
00:05:33,746 --> 00:05:34,844
<i>If Art can start to get</i>

39
00:05:34,845 --> 00:05:36,410
<i>some confidence
and play well.</i>

40
00:05:36,411 --> 00:05:37,482
<i>This is a great opportunity
to end that losing streak</i>

41
00:05:37,483 --> 00:05:38,851
<i>going into the US Open.</i>

42
00:05:38,852 --> 00:05:40,384
<i>Feels like he needs this win.</i>

43
00:05:40,385 --> 00:05:42,004
<i>Remember what he's
going for this year.</i>

44
00:05:42,005 --> 00:05:43,623
<i>He's got the six
Grand Slam titles,</i>

45
00:05:43,624 --> 00:05:46,028
<i>two at Wimbledon,
two Aussie Opens,</i>

46
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:47,329
<i>two French Opens,</i>

47
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,531
<i>but he has been
chasing in vain,</i>

48
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:51,815
<i>for years,
that elusive US Open title</i>

49
00:05:51,816 --> 00:05:54,099
<i>to complete
the Career Slam.</i>

50
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,985
<i>What do you think,
any shot that he gets it this year?</i>

51
00:05:55,986 --> 00:05:57,870
<i>I mean, it's not looking good.</i>

52
00:05:57,871 --> 00:05:59,935
<i>I mean, if we just go
on the results this season,</i>

53
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:01,779
<i>it's going to be
tough for him.</i>

54
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,532
<i>But you can never count a guy
like Art out of the conversation.</i>

55
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:07,285
<i>He's got himself back healthy,
he's in really good shape,</i>

56
00:06:07,286 --> 00:06:09,277
<i>he's got a great
support team around him.</i>

57
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:11,649
<i>His coach, Tashi Donaldson,
who also is his wife,</i>

58
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,021
<i>has added a couple
of people to his team.</i>

59
00:06:14,022 --> 00:06:16,361
<i>He's got a new physiotherapist,
and he's got a new hitting partner.</i>

60
00:06:16,362 --> 00:06:18,794
<i>So everything's there
for him to do well.</i>

61
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,660
<i>Now it's just the matter can he get
his game back on track.</i>

62
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:22,527
<i>Yeah,
his fans are hoping we'll start</i>

63
00:06:22,528 --> 00:06:23,795
<i>to see more of the...</i>

64
00:06:23,796 --> 00:06:25,516
All right, I'm going
to go check on the car.

65
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,506
Can you have pancakes?

66
00:06:29,107 --> 00:06:30,167
I don't know, can I?

67
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:32,903
Feed me.

68
00:06:32,904 --> 00:06:34,941
- No, you're too old.
- No, who says that?

69
00:06:34,942 --> 00:06:36,980
- Who said I'm old?
- You said that.

70
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:38,039
- Here.
- No,

71
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,250
grandmas can have pancakes,
come on.

72
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:40,699
<i>Just a matter of...</i>

73
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,147
One bite. I won't tell.

74
00:06:42,148 --> 00:06:43,481
<i>...if he can click
into that mindset.</i>

75
00:06:43,482 --> 00:06:44,816
<i>Exactly.
And you know he's got</i>

76
00:06:44,817 --> 00:06:46,315
<i>a lot of things
going for him here.</i>

77
00:06:46,316 --> 00:06:48,026
<i>He knows this tournament,
he likes this tournament,</i>

78
00:06:48,027 --> 00:06:49,491
<i>and he's won here a few times.</i>

79
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,820
<i>And he's got
a great record on hard courts.</i>

80
00:06:51,821 --> 00:06:52,989
<i>So, if he can somehow</i>

81
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,388
<i>find a way to get...</i>

82
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:55,764
Your mom and dad are
going to go to work,

83
00:06:55,765 --> 00:06:56,761
and then you and me
are gonna do some reading,

84
00:06:56,762 --> 00:06:58,333
and then go swimming
at the pool.

85
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,900
Can we watch a movie?

86
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:01,863
Later, first we're gonna
keep reading the book

87
00:07:01,864 --> 00:07:03,237
we started yesterday.

88
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:06,100
The one about the giraffe?

89
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:07,638
Mm, no,
we finished that one.

90
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:09,177
We're gonna keep
reading the one...

91
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,441
Inside out!

92
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:12,781
Cross.

93
00:07:15,052 --> 00:07:16,052
Inside out.

94
00:07:17,616 --> 00:07:18,616
Down the line.

95
00:07:21,218 --> 00:07:22,856
There was
a massager in the car?

96
00:07:22,857 --> 00:07:25,086
- You grabbed that, right?
- No, the other one.

97
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:26,863
Oh, yeah,
it's in there.

98
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:29,598
I want you to force him
into as many backhand rallies as you can.

99
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,060
He has one big weapon,
and he wants to use it

100
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:32,801
against you,
so take it away from him.

101
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:38,273
<i>The BB and T Atlanta Open</i>

102
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:40,477
<i>is a non-smoking event.</i>

103
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:42,896
<i>All use of tobacco products
and e-cigarettes</i>

104
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:44,756
<i>is strictly prohibited
on event grounds</i>

105
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:46,615
<i>except for designated
smoking areas.</i>

106
00:07:46,616 --> 00:07:49,881
Mr. Donaldson...
Mr. Donaldson, would you?

107
00:07:49,882 --> 00:07:51,588
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

108
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:53,685
- I'm rooting for you.
- Did you see that look?

109
00:07:53,686 --> 00:07:55,783
- He's gonna crush me, huh?
- Don't think about it, Leo.

110
00:07:56,822 --> 00:07:58,662
Art, over here, over here!

111
00:08:41,535 --> 00:08:42,535
Yeah?

112
00:08:43,472 --> 00:08:44,708
They're ready for you.

113
00:08:50,378 --> 00:08:51,378
You ready?

114
00:08:58,488 --> 00:08:59,657
Decimate that little bitch.

115
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:56,677
<i>Yeah,
this match is looking like</i>

116
00:09:56,678 --> 00:09:58,276
<i>what we've come to expect
from Donaldson.</i>

117
00:09:58,277 --> 00:10:00,215
<i>Just can't seem
to find his footing.</i>

118
00:10:00,216 --> 00:10:03,553
<i>And it's given Du Maurier
the confidence he needs.</i>

119
00:10:03,554 --> 00:10:04,749
<i>- Out!
- Ouch,</i>

120
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,384
<i>this is getting brutal.</i>

121
00:10:06,385 --> 00:10:08,851
<i>You just can't
be missing shots like that.</i>

122
00:10:17,128 --> 00:10:18,692
<i>And there goes the racket.</i>

123
00:10:18,693 --> 00:10:20,529
<i>- Yeah, you...</i>
- He was playing really well.

124
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,604
<i>...can really see
the frustration setting in.</i>

125
00:10:21,605 --> 00:10:22,803
<i>I mean, I get it.</i>

126
00:10:22,804 --> 00:10:23,966
I'm pulling you
out of Cincinnati.

127
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:25,242
- Baby.
- Might as well

128
00:10:25,243 --> 00:10:26,710
pull you out of the Open too,

129
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:28,710
if this isn't gonna be
your year then, why bother?

130
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,446
I'm just rusty.
It's a confidence thing.

131
00:10:30,447 --> 00:10:32,178
Get your fucking
confidence back.

132
00:10:33,153 --> 00:10:34,616
I can't do that for you.

133
00:10:34,617 --> 00:10:36,079
No one's asking you to.

134
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,360
When you play
like that, you are.

135
00:10:38,824 --> 00:10:40,920
I would've killed
to have a recovery like yours.

136
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:43,327
I literally would
fucking stab someone.

137
00:10:43,328 --> 00:10:44,727
A child, an old lady, like...

138
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,290
I think that
they're almost done, okay?

139
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,062
- Where are they?
- In the living room.

140
00:10:48,063 --> 00:10:50,328
They're watching Daddy's match
from earlier today.

141
00:10:51,537 --> 00:10:52,834
Mom said
we could watch it.

142
00:10:52,835 --> 00:10:55,168
What do we need to do
to get you to play again?

143
00:10:57,169 --> 00:10:58,941
What do you
need me to do, hmm?

144
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:04,141
- Hey, baby.
- Mommy?

145
00:11:04,142 --> 00:11:06,980
- What's up?
- Can we watch <i>Spider-Verse?</i>

146
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:09,080
Of course we can.
Of course we can. Come here.

147
00:11:09,081 --> 00:11:11,184
We're just talking about
tennis right now.

148
00:11:11,185 --> 00:11:13,289
But you're always
talking about tennis.

149
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,155
I know. I know.

150
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:17,351
Uh, ooh, how about this?

151
00:11:17,352 --> 00:11:18,858
How about you
start it with Grandma?

152
00:11:18,859 --> 00:11:20,457
And then,
I'll come in a second

153
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,357
and we can order some room service
and watch it together.

154
00:11:22,358 --> 00:11:24,025
- How about that?
- What do they have

155
00:11:24,026 --> 00:11:25,195
for room service?

156
00:11:25,196 --> 00:11:26,831
I don't know.
I don't know, I...

157
00:11:33,742 --> 00:11:35,175
She likes it here.

158
00:11:38,317 --> 00:11:39,751
We can keep staying here.

159
00:11:43,484 --> 00:11:44,484
We can.

160
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:51,562
We can stay here.
We can just be rich people.

161
00:11:51,563 --> 00:11:53,259
That's all you
think you can handle.

162
00:11:54,695 --> 00:11:56,224
We can travel.

163
00:11:56,225 --> 00:11:58,066
We can do
the foundation full-time.

164
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:01,872
Or you keep being
a tennis player.

165
00:12:04,234 --> 00:12:06,536
Which is what you are. Still.

166
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:10,512
What do you want?

167
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,358
What do you want?

168
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,892
I'm gonna be a tennis player.

169
00:12:29,893 --> 00:12:32,735
Good. Good.

170
00:12:32,736 --> 00:12:34,338
Okay,
well, we need to get you

171
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:35,703
some more match time then.

172
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:37,068
I can play Cincinnati.

173
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:39,272
No. No, you cannot.
Not like this.

174
00:12:40,477 --> 00:12:42,279
Okay, how about,

175
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,309
how about New Rochelle?

176
00:12:46,411 --> 00:12:48,776
- That's a challenger.
- Yeah, I know that.

177
00:12:48,777 --> 00:12:51,383
It's in a couple of days.
Maybe we can get you a wildcard.

178
00:12:54,722 --> 00:12:56,058
- Art?
- Hmm.

179
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,654
You need to start winning.

180
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:03,560
Right now, you're getting crushed
by guys like Du Maurier.

181
00:13:05,405 --> 00:13:07,552
So we need to go somewhere,

182
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,700
where there's absolutely nobody

183
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:12,668
on the other side of the net
who can shake your fucking confidence.

184
00:13:14,575 --> 00:13:16,138
Okay?

185
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:18,540
That's why we're going to...

186
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,820
Phil's Tire Town Challenger.

187
00:13:24,122 --> 00:13:26,079
- Don't get knocked out the first round.
- You're evil.

188
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,490
Yeah, well, I'm gonna call Tom,
see if he can get you in the draw.

189
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:29,828
- Hey.
- Yeah.

190
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:32,087
I love you.

191
00:13:33,297 --> 00:13:35,089
I know.

192
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,626
<i>How much do you think
you'd pay the first serve today?</i>

193
00:13:36,627 --> 00:13:38,292
<i>Honestly.
He looks like he doesn't</i>

194
00:13:38,293 --> 00:13:39,945
<i>even wanna be out there.</i>

195
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,333
Hey!

196
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:12,835
Can I pay tomorrow?

197
00:14:12,836 --> 00:14:16,335
I've been driving all day,
I'm exhausted.

198
00:14:16,336 --> 00:14:18,500
You know, if we gave out
a bed to every tired person

199
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:20,873
who walked in here
asking for one...

200
00:14:20,874 --> 00:14:22,175
Right.

201
00:14:22,176 --> 00:14:24,810
...we'd be a homeless shelter
not a business.

202
00:14:24,811 --> 00:14:25,840
Uh-huh.

203
00:14:28,653 --> 00:14:30,877
Listen, I'm a tennis player.

204
00:14:30,878 --> 00:14:33,391
- Hmm.
- You know the tournament down the road?

205
00:14:33,392 --> 00:14:35,021
Oh, that, uh... The thing

206
00:14:35,022 --> 00:14:37,491
- at the country club.
- Right, right.

207
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:40,343
- Yeah.
- Well, you get $7,000 if you win.

208
00:14:40,344 --> 00:14:42,902
And you get money
just for qualifying.

209
00:14:42,903 --> 00:14:44,932
I just... I need a place
to stay tonight

210
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:46,963
so I can rest before
my first match.

211
00:14:46,964 --> 00:14:50,132
Oh, I'm sorry.

212
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:52,501
I need a card on file.

213
00:14:52,502 --> 00:14:54,411
What if I signed a racket
and gave it to you?

214
00:14:54,412 --> 00:14:55,702
- Sir.
- Mm-hmm.

215
00:14:55,703 --> 00:14:58,543
Sir, I don't know who you are.

216
00:15:03,582 --> 00:15:04,886
- I told you I'm...
- Look at this guy.

217
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:06,201
...a professional
tennis player.

218
00:15:06,202 --> 00:15:07,516
- He's a disaster.
- I don't know,

219
00:15:07,517 --> 00:15:09,788
- I think he's kind of cute.
- Carl, he smells.

220
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:11,556
- The racket alone...
- He's an athlete.

221
00:15:11,557 --> 00:15:13,324
- ...is worth like...
- He doesn't look

222
00:15:13,325 --> 00:15:14,858
like an athlete,
he looks like a hobo.

223
00:15:14,859 --> 00:15:15,930
...$300.

224
00:15:15,931 --> 00:15:17,493
Very tall,
very handsome hobo.

225
00:15:17,494 --> 00:15:19,668
You're like a dog.

226
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,070
We need a card that works.

227
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:24,036
Look at him,
he can't pay for the room.

228
00:15:24,037 --> 00:15:25,170
Should we invite him

229
00:15:25,171 --> 00:15:26,811
to come stay with us?

230
00:15:29,414 --> 00:15:30,414
Hey!

231
00:15:31,482 --> 00:15:34,341
Hello! Name?

232
00:15:34,342 --> 00:15:36,217
Barry Gardner.

233
00:15:36,218 --> 00:15:39,087
You know, this looks very different
from the website.

234
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:41,124
Oh, we're doing
some renovations.

235
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,692
I just think you should
maybe update your pictures

236
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:44,961
to reflect, you know...

237
00:15:44,962 --> 00:15:48,030
<i>The Clinton campaign paid</i>

238
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:52,795
<i>a million dollars
to use your GPS to hire...</i>

239
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:41,679
Sir, you can't sleep here.

240
00:16:47,793 --> 00:16:49,459
I'm not.
I'm playing at the...

241
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,125
Sir, this is a private club.

242
00:16:51,126 --> 00:16:52,289
- I'm gonna have to ask you...
- No.

243
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,357
- ...to leave.
- No, no, no.

244
00:16:53,358 --> 00:16:55,528
I'm in the Challenger.
I'm a player.

245
00:16:56,868 --> 00:16:59,334
Oh. Well...

246
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:03,635
You're a bit early
for check-in.

247
00:17:04,368 --> 00:17:05,806
We're just opening up.

248
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,387
Just head right in there.
She's just setting up.

249
00:17:35,336 --> 00:17:37,741
Can I help you?

250
00:17:37,742 --> 00:17:39,935
I'm a tennis player.

251
00:17:42,374 --> 00:17:45,380
I'm playing
in the Challenger.

252
00:17:45,945 --> 00:17:47,516
Name?

253
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:49,010
Patrick Zweig.

254
00:17:51,384 --> 00:17:53,489
Oh, wow!
That's right.

255
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,588
You are!

256
00:17:58,557 --> 00:18:00,057
You probably
don't remember this,

257
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:01,843
but I was
one of the line judges

258
00:18:01,844 --> 00:18:03,629
at the Junior US Open
back in '06.

259
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:08,964
Huh, wow.

260
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,442
You hungry?

261
00:18:15,612 --> 00:18:16,807
Uh...

262
00:18:17,648 --> 00:18:18,875
Yeah. Yeah.

263
00:18:20,111 --> 00:18:21,251
Thanks.

264
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:27,752
Mm-mm.

265
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:30,523
Well, we're happy
to have you here.

266
00:18:30,524 --> 00:18:35,927
You got your first match
against Grosu this afternoon.

267
00:18:35,928 --> 00:18:38,597
Should be a nice tournament.
Supposed to get a little windy mid-week,

268
00:18:38,598 --> 00:18:40,904
but hopefully it'll clear up
before the finals.

269
00:18:40,905 --> 00:18:42,603
- Fingers crossed.
- I was wondering,

270
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:45,004
is there any chance for an advance payment
on the prize money?

271
00:18:46,141 --> 00:18:48,373
- Oh.
- Just because I'm...

272
00:18:48,374 --> 00:18:50,474
I know I'm guaranteed
a minimum of $400

273
00:18:50,475 --> 00:18:52,248
even if I get
knocked out today.

274
00:18:52,249 --> 00:18:54,546
Well, generally, we don't give
out the winnings until

275
00:18:54,547 --> 00:18:55,883
player makes his way
through the tournament.

276
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,383
Right. It's just...

277
00:18:57,384 --> 00:18:59,481
I had a problem
with my card at the hotel.

278
00:18:59,482 --> 00:19:01,254
- And...
- You could

279
00:19:01,255 --> 00:19:02,916
just always lose today...

280
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:04,855
Then we'd have to cut
your check this evening.

281
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:10,028
Right.

282
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:18,401
By the way,

283
00:19:18,402 --> 00:19:20,009
there's a rumor
going around

284
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,938
that we had
a last-minute wildcard.

285
00:19:24,343 --> 00:19:25,546
Wanna guess who it is?

286
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,775
Who?

287
00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:15,497
Advantage, Donaldson.

288
00:20:22,732 --> 00:20:24,935
- Come on!
- Go, let's go!

289
00:20:29,244 --> 00:20:30,413
Fault!

290
00:20:39,022 --> 00:20:40,588
Fuck!

291
00:20:42,051 --> 00:20:44,552
Code violation,
audible obscenity.

292
00:20:44,553 --> 00:20:46,220
Warning, Donaldson.

293
00:20:47,797 --> 00:20:48,959
Deuce.

294
00:20:57,704 --> 00:20:59,344
- All right.
- Come on, Art.

295
00:21:09,999 --> 00:21:12,287
Advantage, Zweig.

296
00:21:12,288 --> 00:21:14,439
Get it together, Art.
You got this.

297
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,591
He almost got
another penalty.

298
00:21:48,484 --> 00:21:49,921
Yeah!

299
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:51,362
Yes!

300
00:21:52,591 --> 00:21:55,157
Let's go!

301
00:21:56,701 --> 00:21:57,863
Yeah!

302
00:22:00,168 --> 00:22:01,497
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

303
00:22:01,498 --> 00:22:04,441
Come on. Come on. Come on.

304
00:22:06,311 --> 00:22:07,405
- Hey, guys!
- Hey, guys!

305
00:22:07,406 --> 00:22:08,804
Thank you, man.

306
00:22:08,805 --> 00:22:10,070
- Good play.
- Good one, man.

307
00:22:10,071 --> 00:22:11,507
- Nice meeting you.
- Good one, man.

308
00:22:11,508 --> 00:22:13,396
Yeah.

309
00:22:15,286 --> 00:22:16,787
Fire and Ice, baby.
Let's go!

310
00:22:16,788 --> 00:22:18,416
Take it off!

311
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,494
- Can you do me a favor?
- Mm-hmm.

312
00:22:27,495 --> 00:22:29,079
Can you not
demolish me tomorrow?

313
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,664
- Shut the fuck up.
- Listen,

314
00:22:30,665 --> 00:22:32,861
I'm at peace with the fact
that you're going to win.

315
00:22:32,862 --> 00:22:35,267
- It's not a fact.
- I'm just saying,

316
00:22:35,268 --> 00:22:37,672
throw me a couple of games,
maybe a set.

317
00:22:37,673 --> 00:22:39,966
If it matters to you so much,
I can just give it to you.

318
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:41,274
- Really?
- Yeah.

319
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:42,509
- Wow! Thanks.
- I mean,

320
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,226
every once in a while
a kid who wins juniors

321
00:22:44,227 --> 00:22:45,942
turns out to be
an actually great player,

322
00:22:45,943 --> 00:22:48,546
but most of them end up
in, like, the top 300.

323
00:22:48,547 --> 00:22:50,180
- It's a curse.
- You said,

324
00:22:50,181 --> 00:22:52,520
you seemed pretty excited
about winning the doubles trophy.

325
00:22:52,521 --> 00:22:54,957
That was different.
That was just you and me.

326
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,086
This is really fun.

327
00:22:57,554 --> 00:22:58,726
Huh.

328
00:23:00,162 --> 00:23:01,399
All right, well...

329
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,212
But you have to actually play.

330
00:23:04,213 --> 00:23:05,664
You know,
you can't just retire.

331
00:23:05,665 --> 00:23:07,650
I need it to look like
I really beat you.

332
00:23:07,651 --> 00:23:09,636
Mm. Have you got money
on this or something?

333
00:23:09,637 --> 00:23:11,554
No. My grandma,
she's gonna be watching

334
00:23:11,555 --> 00:23:13,472
with her nursing home.
She keeps calling me

335
00:23:13,473 --> 00:23:15,641
telling me
how proud she is.

336
00:23:15,642 --> 00:23:17,242
Don't guilt me
with your dying grandmother.

337
00:23:29,689 --> 00:23:31,320
Now entering the court...

338
00:23:31,321 --> 00:23:33,492
Did Mark tell you
about the party on Long Island?

339
00:23:33,493 --> 00:23:35,024
- The Adidas thing?
- Yeah.

340
00:23:35,025 --> 00:23:36,767
- Anna Mueller.
- Yeah, I'm not going.

341
00:23:36,768 --> 00:23:37,859
What? Why not?

342
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,095
We have
a final tomorrow.

343
00:23:40,096 --> 00:23:43,000
- I just told you I'd let you win.
- Mm-hmm.

344
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:45,538
Don't you want to meet Tashi Duncan?

345
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:48,077
You don't get it, man.
You've never seen her in person.

346
00:23:48,078 --> 00:23:49,446
She's in another league.

347
00:23:49,447 --> 00:23:51,245
- And now entering...
- You mean her game?

348
00:23:51,246 --> 00:23:53,565
No, I mean,
she's the hottest woman I've ever seen.

349
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:55,885
And winner
of the Junior Australian Open,

350
00:23:55,886 --> 00:23:57,111
Tashi Duncan.

351
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,253
Yeah, baby! Yeah!

352
00:24:23,847 --> 00:24:26,140
Ladies and gentlemen,
this final round match

353
00:24:26,141 --> 00:24:28,277
will be the best
of three tie-break sets.

354
00:24:28,278 --> 00:24:30,414
To the left of the chair,
from Switzerland,

355
00:24:30,415 --> 00:24:32,247
Anna Mueller.

356
00:24:32,248 --> 00:24:34,385
To the right of the chair,
from the United States,

357
00:24:34,386 --> 00:24:36,150
Tashi Duncan.

358
00:24:36,151 --> 00:24:38,652
Duncan won the toss
and elected to serve.

359
00:24:38,653 --> 00:24:39,794
Fuck.

360
00:24:48,001 --> 00:24:50,772
First set, Duncan to serve.
Ready?

361
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,041
Play.

362
00:25:07,116 --> 00:25:09,021
Look at that
fucking backhand.

363
00:25:13,626 --> 00:25:14,624
Fifteen, love.

364
00:25:38,485 --> 00:25:39,854
Forty, love.

365
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,182
Come on!

366
00:26:12,421 --> 00:26:13,421
Forty, thirty.

367
00:27:10,477 --> 00:27:14,042
She's gonna turn her whole family
into millionaires.

368
00:27:14,043 --> 00:27:15,914
She'll have a fashion line,

369
00:27:15,915 --> 00:27:17,787
a nutritional supplement,

370
00:27:18,453 --> 00:27:20,588
a foundation.

371
00:27:20,589 --> 00:27:22,537
The Tashi Duncan Center
for Girls.

372
00:27:22,538 --> 00:27:24,485
Taking at-risk youth
off the streets

373
00:27:24,486 --> 00:27:26,121
- and onto the courts.
- Come on. Don't make fun, man.

374
00:27:26,122 --> 00:27:27,656
She's a remarkable
young woman.

375
00:27:27,657 --> 00:27:29,598
I know.

376
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:31,702
I know,
she's a pillar of the community.

377
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:37,103
I'd let her fuck me
with a racket.

378
00:27:41,137 --> 00:27:43,640
Oh, God.
Look, Anna Mueller.

379
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:34,828
- Oh, my God.
- Oy.

380
00:28:34,829 --> 00:28:36,558
I'm gonna go get my drink.

381
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:45,703
- Hey, I'm Patrick Zweig.
- Art Donaldson.

382
00:28:45,704 --> 00:28:47,041
I know who you are.

383
00:28:47,841 --> 00:28:49,294
You're Fire and Ice, right?

384
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:50,748
- Oh, my God.
- In the flesh.

385
00:28:54,076 --> 00:28:55,392
Which one's which?

386
00:28:55,393 --> 00:28:56,710
What do you think?

387
00:28:58,085 --> 00:29:00,347
You were
fucking incredible today.

388
00:29:00,348 --> 00:29:01,425
- Thank you.
- No, really. I mean,

389
00:29:01,426 --> 00:29:03,416
it wasn't even,
like, tennis.

390
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:05,085
It was an entirely
different game.

391
00:29:05,086 --> 00:29:06,891
I felt bad for Anna.

392
00:29:06,892 --> 00:29:08,554
Oh, uh, don't.
She's a sore loser

393
00:29:08,555 --> 00:29:10,196
And a racist bitch.

394
00:29:12,699 --> 00:29:13,699
She'll be okay.

395
00:29:15,706 --> 00:29:17,032
You're going
to Stanford, right?

396
00:29:17,033 --> 00:29:18,402
Yeah, how'd you know that?

397
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:22,741
Um...
I just accepted my offer

398
00:29:22,742 --> 00:29:24,056
and they mentioned you.

399
00:29:24,057 --> 00:29:25,371
- Really?
- Yeah.

400
00:29:25,372 --> 00:29:26,732
- Oh.
- You're not going pro?

401
00:29:28,714 --> 00:29:29,820
No, not yet.

402
00:29:31,923 --> 00:29:34,357
Why do you waste your time
playing college tennis?

403
00:29:34,358 --> 00:29:36,449
Baby...

404
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,222
I need to steal you
for a second.

405
00:29:38,223 --> 00:29:39,995
- Over at the trophies.
- Uh, okay.

406
00:29:40,927 --> 00:29:42,565
I have to go
take pictures.

407
00:29:42,566 --> 00:29:45,225
So, um, it was nice
meeting you both.

408
00:29:45,226 --> 00:29:46,298
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

409
00:29:49,505 --> 00:29:50,505
Okay.

410
00:30:10,095 --> 00:30:11,559
Now what?

411
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,075
What do you mean?
That was it.

412
00:30:13,076 --> 00:30:14,591
You don't wanna
stick around,

413
00:30:14,592 --> 00:30:16,263
- try to talk to her again?
- No, no, that'll seem too desperate.

414
00:30:16,264 --> 00:30:18,333
We should just wait
for the shuttle back to the hotel.

415
00:30:18,334 --> 00:30:19,463
Yeah, sure.

416
00:30:20,369 --> 00:30:21,432
Okay.

417
00:30:23,204 --> 00:30:24,498
Bring it up
for me a little bit.

418
00:30:24,499 --> 00:30:27,042
All right.
Great, great. Good job.

419
00:30:31,109 --> 00:30:33,048
- Let's go.
- Yeah. Let's go.

420
00:30:43,288 --> 00:30:45,922
Bye,
Miss Stanford University.

421
00:30:45,923 --> 00:30:47,029
Okay, bye.

422
00:30:49,565 --> 00:30:50,565
- Hey!
- Hi!

423
00:30:52,027 --> 00:30:53,068
Hi.

424
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,002
You guys are still here.

425
00:30:56,003 --> 00:30:57,803
- Great party!
- Uh-huh, yeah.

426
00:30:58,133 --> 00:30:59,601
Thank you.

427
00:30:59,602 --> 00:31:02,054
Um, don't you guys have a final?

428
00:31:02,055 --> 00:31:03,998
Shouldn't you be, like, um,
preparing or something?

429
00:31:03,999 --> 00:31:05,942
- Oh, it's just the juniors.
- I think we both know

430
00:31:05,943 --> 00:31:07,082
how it's gonna go.

431
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,182
Okay, well, um,
it's cool that you stayed.

432
00:31:11,183 --> 00:31:12,348
- Yeah. I actually wanted...
- Yeah.

433
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:13,480
...to ask you about
that point earlier...

434
00:31:13,481 --> 00:31:15,621
- Hey, do you smoke?
- Cigarettes?

435
00:31:15,622 --> 00:31:16,652
- Yeah.
- No.

436
00:31:17,857 --> 00:31:19,754
- Do you?
- Yeah.

437
00:31:20,896 --> 00:31:22,163
Want to go down
to the beach?

438
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:27,803
Sure.

439
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:29,202
This place is ridiculous,
isn't it?

440
00:31:29,203 --> 00:31:31,365
What do you mean?
What do you mean? It's nice.

441
00:31:31,366 --> 00:31:33,568
It's like a castle.

442
00:31:33,569 --> 00:31:35,505
Like, they wanna be
feudal lords or something.

443
00:31:35,506 --> 00:31:37,708
Oh, and what does
your parents' place look like?

444
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:39,046
Exactly.

445
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:40,816
- Not like this.
- No, it's bigger.

446
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:44,179
No. I mean, yeah,
technically it is. Yeah.

447
00:31:49,425 --> 00:31:52,262
So, I have to ask
you about this Stanford thing.

448
00:31:52,263 --> 00:31:53,359
Okay.

449
00:31:55,466 --> 00:31:57,824
What's the angle?

450
00:31:57,825 --> 00:32:00,013
Why do you want to go beat up
on a bunch of girls

451
00:32:00,014 --> 00:32:02,203
who were the best players
at their high schools?

452
00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:11,677
You know,
they offer classes in college.

453
00:32:11,678 --> 00:32:14,479
I don't want my only skill in life
to be hitting a ball with a racket.

454
00:32:15,748 --> 00:32:16,811
I get it.

455
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:20,584
You're making us
wait for you.

456
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:24,856
The 18-year-old
tennis phenomenon

457
00:32:24,857 --> 00:32:26,755
who cares about
her education.

458
00:32:28,096 --> 00:32:29,593
Is this why you
came to my party?

459
00:32:31,262 --> 00:32:33,230
It's brilliant. Seriously.

460
00:32:33,231 --> 00:32:35,434
I can already see
the Adidas campaign.

461
00:32:36,938 --> 00:32:38,107
And when are you going pro?

462
00:32:40,236 --> 00:32:41,506
Soon as I can.

463
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:44,613
Hitting a ball with a racket
is a great way

464
00:32:44,614 --> 00:32:46,143
to avoid having a job.

465
00:32:46,144 --> 00:32:48,377
Well, that's also
your problem.

466
00:32:48,378 --> 00:32:50,315
'Cause you think
that tennis is about

467
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:52,252
expressing yourself,
doing your thing.

468
00:32:52,253 --> 00:32:54,783
- That's why you still have that serve.
- It works.

469
00:32:56,619 --> 00:32:58,325
Yeah, but you're not
a tennis player.

470
00:33:00,523 --> 00:33:02,032
You don't know
what tennis is.

471
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:04,331
What is it?

472
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:07,268
It's a relationship.

473
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:14,789
Is that what you
and Anna Mueller had today?

474
00:33:16,811 --> 00:33:18,048
It is, actually.

475
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,775
For about 15 seconds there,
we were actually playing tennis,

476
00:33:22,776 --> 00:33:24,950
and we understood
each other completely.

477
00:33:24,951 --> 00:33:26,155
So did everyone watching.

478
00:33:27,626 --> 00:33:29,158
It was like we were in love.

479
00:33:33,895 --> 00:33:35,560
Or like we didn't exist.

480
00:33:39,471 --> 00:33:40,730
We went somewhere

481
00:33:41,805 --> 00:33:43,296
really beautiful together.

482
00:33:43,297 --> 00:33:44,299
You screamed.

483
00:33:50,681 --> 00:33:52,815
When you hit the winner.

484
00:33:52,816 --> 00:33:54,711
Never heard
anything like it before.

485
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:07,456
I should go

486
00:34:07,457 --> 00:34:09,540
before my dad comes
looking for me.

487
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:11,624
- I'll see you at school, Art.
- Wait,

488
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:13,423
- are you on Facebook?
- What?

489
00:34:13,424 --> 00:34:15,222
He's asking
for your number.

490
00:34:16,364 --> 00:34:17,404
And so am I.

491
00:34:19,077 --> 00:34:21,205
- You both want my number?
- Very much so, yeah.

492
00:34:21,206 --> 00:34:23,144
- Yeah.
- Okay, well,

493
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:25,039
- I'm not a homewrecker.
- We don't live together.

494
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,578
- It's an open relationship.
- Also, Patrick has a girlfriend.

495
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:30,052
I do not. Hey,
come hang out with us later.

496
00:34:30,053 --> 00:34:32,569
They put you up at the hotel
in Flushing, right?

497
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,087
- We're in Room 206.
- Want me to come tuck you in?

498
00:34:35,088 --> 00:34:37,886
No. We just keep talking...

499
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:39,855
About tennis.

500
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,898
Good night.

501
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:46,059
- We have beer.
- Okay.

502
00:35:12,161 --> 00:35:14,791
I'm looking
in my bag right now.

503
00:35:14,792 --> 00:35:17,524
Did you look
in the small pocket on the side?

504
00:35:17,525 --> 00:35:19,413
I promise that's in there.

505
00:35:24,436 --> 00:35:27,786
It's broken.

506
00:35:27,787 --> 00:35:31,136
- And she's not coming.
- She might.

507
00:35:31,137 --> 00:35:33,377
You made it sound like
we wanted to fuck her in here.

508
00:35:33,378 --> 00:35:34,577
We do want to
fuck her in here.

509
00:35:34,578 --> 00:35:37,615
Okay, yeah, maybe.
But what was your plan?

510
00:35:37,616 --> 00:35:39,923
All right, let's say she did come over.
Then what?

511
00:35:39,924 --> 00:35:41,751
We just like,
keep shooting our shot

512
00:35:41,752 --> 00:35:44,621
until she ends up making out
with one of us, hopefully,

513
00:35:44,622 --> 00:35:46,960
and the other one,
sits in the bathroom?

514
00:35:46,961 --> 00:35:48,661
Sure, if it came to that.

515
00:35:48,662 --> 00:35:51,228
- What? You think that's beneath you?
- I think it's beneath her.

516
00:35:51,229 --> 00:35:52,562
What if she chooses you?

517
00:35:52,563 --> 00:35:54,099
You won't feel comfortable
sending me away?

518
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,770
She's not coming, Patrick!

519
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,287
- Art!
- What?

520
00:36:14,288 --> 00:36:15,854
- Fucking ash!
- I found it.

521
00:36:15,855 --> 00:36:16,886
Oh, dude.

522
00:36:21,665 --> 00:36:22,665
Wait.

523
00:36:23,061 --> 00:36:24,061
Oh, shit.

524
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,863
- Hi!
- Hey!

525
00:36:28,571 --> 00:36:31,533
Did you guys go to, like,
Mommy And Me classes together?

526
00:36:33,804 --> 00:36:35,544
What?
You just seem like brothers.

527
00:36:35,545 --> 00:36:38,706
Well, that's what the Mark Rebellato
Tennis Academy will do for you.

528
00:36:38,707 --> 00:36:40,445
Oh. Right, right, right.

529
00:36:40,446 --> 00:36:42,183
You guys went
to boarding school.

530
00:36:42,184 --> 00:36:44,645
Mm. We've been bunkmates
since we were 12.

531
00:36:44,646 --> 00:36:46,012
- So...
- That's really cute.

532
00:36:46,013 --> 00:36:47,714
You ever thought about
doing something like that?

533
00:36:47,715 --> 00:36:48,848
- Boarding school?
- Mm.

534
00:36:48,849 --> 00:36:50,292
No. No, no, no.
We couldn't afford it.

535
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:52,128
And even if I could get
a scholarship or something,

536
00:36:52,129 --> 00:36:53,729
there's no way that
my parents would want me

537
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,331
coming of age
in an environment like that.

538
00:36:56,325 --> 00:36:57,493
Huh.

539
00:36:57,494 --> 00:36:59,368
Why? What were
they afraid of?

540
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:05,240
- Oh, yeah.
- Right.

541
00:37:05,241 --> 00:37:07,700
So, um, is that
where you met your girlfriend?

542
00:37:07,701 --> 00:37:09,169
Oh, she's not my, um...

543
00:37:10,109 --> 00:37:11,509
Yeah, yeah.

544
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,046
And you?
Why aren't you pretending

545
00:37:13,047 --> 00:37:14,148
not to have a girlfriend?

546
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:15,747
- Art's in between ladies.
- Oh, no, no.

547
00:37:15,748 --> 00:37:17,347
That makes it sound
like I'm some sort of...

548
00:37:17,348 --> 00:37:18,416
- Player.
- Yeah.

549
00:37:18,417 --> 00:37:20,187
Yeah,
Art does fine for himself.

550
00:37:20,188 --> 00:37:22,358
I mean, look at him.

551
00:37:22,956 --> 00:37:23,956
So...

552
00:37:26,557 --> 00:37:28,096
How often
does this happen?

553
00:37:28,097 --> 00:37:29,761
- Uh...
- Going after the same girl.

554
00:37:29,762 --> 00:37:31,426
Not as often
as you think actually.

555
00:37:31,427 --> 00:37:32,427
- Really?
- No.

556
00:37:32,428 --> 00:37:33,694
Yeah, no, we, uh...

557
00:37:33,695 --> 00:37:35,060
We usually have
different types.

558
00:37:35,061 --> 00:37:38,003
Hmm. So you're saying
I should be flattered?

559
00:37:38,004 --> 00:37:39,336
- Well...
- No.

560
00:37:39,337 --> 00:37:40,772
Aren't you
everybody's type?

561
00:37:47,314 --> 00:37:48,751
What about the two of you?

562
00:37:48,752 --> 00:37:50,111
What do you mean?

563
00:37:55,285 --> 00:37:56,538
Oh!

564
00:37:56,539 --> 00:37:57,791
No.

565
00:37:57,792 --> 00:37:59,494
No.

566
00:38:01,063 --> 00:38:02,959
Why? Is that surprising?

567
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:09,803
What?

568
00:38:09,804 --> 00:38:11,132
- Well...
- No.

569
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:14,537
- I mean...
- No.

570
00:38:14,538 --> 00:38:16,006
- Patrick, no.
- Sorry.

571
00:38:16,007 --> 00:38:17,555
Yes. I think you need
to tell me now.

572
00:38:17,556 --> 00:38:19,104
- No.
- I think it's a sweet story.

573
00:38:19,105 --> 00:38:21,245
- Uh-huh. All right.
- Well, let's hear it.

574
00:38:21,246 --> 00:38:22,807
Yeah, no, go ahead.

575
00:38:22,808 --> 00:38:24,085
Uh...

576
00:38:24,086 --> 00:38:27,247
I taught Art
how to jerk off, so.

577
00:38:30,591 --> 00:38:33,293
Okay. Patrick was
an early bloomer, okay?

578
00:38:33,294 --> 00:38:35,813
And I think
that I was on time.

579
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:38,333
And one time,
when we were 12,

580
00:38:38,334 --> 00:38:41,437
he thought I was asleep
and he was, you know...

581
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:44,601
- Jerking off.
- Jerking off. And, yeah...

582
00:38:44,602 --> 00:38:46,336
And I asked him,
"What are you doing?"

583
00:38:46,337 --> 00:38:47,504
And he told me.

584
00:38:47,505 --> 00:38:49,104
- He's jerking off.
- Jerking off.

585
00:38:49,105 --> 00:38:52,144
He asked me if I had ever done it before
and I told him no.

586
00:38:52,145 --> 00:38:54,714
And so, he just...

587
00:38:55,314 --> 00:38:57,152
He showed me how.

588
00:39:00,324 --> 00:39:02,120
What do you mean
he showed you how?

589
00:39:02,121 --> 00:39:03,255
No. I mean...

590
00:39:03,256 --> 00:39:04,927
- Well...
- I mean, he did it

591
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:06,795
- on his bed.
- Okay.

592
00:39:06,796 --> 00:39:09,196
I did it on my bed. We did it together,
but like on opposite sides...

593
00:39:09,197 --> 00:39:10,592
- in the room.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

594
00:39:10,593 --> 00:39:11,896
You know.

595
00:39:15,134 --> 00:39:16,036
Silent?

596
00:39:16,037 --> 00:39:17,371
- Oh, no, no.
- No, no.

597
00:39:17,372 --> 00:39:19,933
No, we were talking
about Kat, weren't we?

598
00:39:19,934 --> 00:39:21,105
- Kat Zimmerman.
- Patrick said

599
00:39:21,106 --> 00:39:22,277
- it's always better...
- Yeah.

600
00:39:22,278 --> 00:39:23,660
...if you're like thinking
about somebody

601
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:25,042
when you're doing it.
And so I asked him

602
00:39:25,043 --> 00:39:27,149
who you're thinking about,
and he was talking about this girl,

603
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,246
- Kat Zimmerman.
- Kat Zimmerman.

604
00:39:29,247 --> 00:39:31,344
And so, I thought
about her, too.

605
00:39:32,747 --> 00:39:34,145
- Wow.
- Yeah.

606
00:39:34,146 --> 00:39:36,475
Okay,
and who finished first?

607
00:39:36,476 --> 00:39:38,805
- Oh, I don't remember.
- I think you.

608
00:39:40,497 --> 00:39:43,447
And, well,
how was it afterwards?

609
00:39:43,448 --> 00:39:46,398
I think Art
was a little surprised

610
00:39:46,399 --> 00:39:48,293
by the whole thing.
He was...

611
00:39:48,294 --> 00:39:50,415
He was just sitting there
covered in all of it.

612
00:39:50,416 --> 00:39:52,538
- What?
- He looked like a kid

613
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:54,176
who'd spilled milk
all over his lap.

614
00:39:54,177 --> 00:39:56,542
Jesus, Patrick!

615
00:39:56,543 --> 00:39:58,307
I knew enough already
at this point

616
00:39:58,308 --> 00:39:59,891
- to have a sock nearby.
- Right.

617
00:39:59,892 --> 00:40:01,476
Forgot to tell Art
about that part.

618
00:40:01,477 --> 00:40:02,646
Yeah.

619
00:40:02,647 --> 00:40:03,817
Mm-hmm.

620
00:40:05,352 --> 00:40:06,384
Yeah, so.

621
00:40:06,385 --> 00:40:09,438
- Yeah.
- Right. Okay.

622
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:12,491
And what about
Miss Zimmerman?

623
00:40:12,492 --> 00:40:14,629
Whatever happened to her?
You guys...

624
00:40:15,757 --> 00:40:17,157
Neither of us...

625
00:40:17,158 --> 00:40:19,594
She got injured
a week later and had to quit.

626
00:40:19,595 --> 00:40:20,997
Really?

627
00:40:20,998 --> 00:40:21,896
She wasn't
very good in the first place.

628
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:23,071
- No, she sucked.
- Yeah.

629
00:40:23,072 --> 00:40:25,397
Yeah.

630
00:40:25,398 --> 00:40:27,207
Yeah, no, you're right.
That is a very cute story.

631
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:28,959
Thanks.

632
00:40:33,478 --> 00:40:34,649
We're out of beer.

633
00:40:43,124 --> 00:40:44,593
Um...

634
00:41:09,854 --> 00:41:10,854
Come here.

635
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:14,150
Which one of us would you...

636
00:43:41,633 --> 00:43:42,698
Okay.

637
00:43:47,441 --> 00:43:48,645
I'm going to bed.

638
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:52,604
What about your number?

639
00:43:52,605 --> 00:43:54,816
- I told you, I'm not a homewrecker.
- Please.

640
00:43:55,647 --> 00:43:57,954
Um...

641
00:43:57,955 --> 00:44:00,114
Okay, uh...

642
00:44:00,115 --> 00:44:01,918
I will be watching
your match tomorrow.

643
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,788
Whoever wins
can have my number.

644
00:44:03,789 --> 00:44:05,321
All right.

645
00:44:06,826 --> 00:44:08,662
You can beat him,
you know that.

646
00:44:08,663 --> 00:44:10,498
You should
beat him actually.

647
00:44:10,499 --> 00:44:12,064
Are you saying
you want me to?

648
00:44:12,065 --> 00:44:14,061
I'm saying you're not going
to get my number if you don't.

649
00:44:14,062 --> 00:44:15,328
But what do you want?

650
00:44:15,329 --> 00:44:18,466
I want to watch
some good fucking tennis.

651
00:44:21,012 --> 00:44:22,012
Good night.

652
00:44:28,544 --> 00:44:30,343
Remember when you said
you'd let me win?

653
00:44:30,344 --> 00:44:32,114
That was
a lifetime ago.

654
00:44:32,115 --> 00:44:33,488
- What about my grandmother?
- Hope she has

655
00:44:33,489 --> 00:44:35,587
a fucking stroke.

656
00:45:06,213 --> 00:45:08,219
Wow.

657
00:45:11,887 --> 00:45:13,224
Thirty, forty.

658
00:45:15,694 --> 00:45:16,960
That's how you do it!

659
00:45:16,961 --> 00:45:20,099
Nice!
That's the way you play!

660
00:45:20,995 --> 00:45:21,995
Go!

661
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,925
Thirty, love.

662
00:45:50,428 --> 00:45:52,577
- Forty, love.
- Come on, Art, you got this!

663
00:45:52,578 --> 00:45:54,727
- It's not over, Art!
- Hang in there, Art!

664
00:45:56,139 --> 00:45:57,301
Fault!

665
00:46:09,277 --> 00:46:11,665
Game and first set, Zweig.

666
00:46:11,666 --> 00:46:14,054
Zweig leads one set to love.

667
00:47:05,602 --> 00:47:08,768
So stupid losing
to guys like this, Victor.

668
00:47:13,317 --> 00:47:14,845
Fucking idiot.

669
00:47:28,464 --> 00:47:29,464
Fuck.

670
00:47:44,505 --> 00:47:46,311
Nice match, Zweig.

671
00:47:48,418 --> 00:47:51,048
You too, Grosu.

672
00:47:51,049 --> 00:47:52,482
Tough break.

673
00:47:58,344 --> 00:47:59,929
Calm, Victor.

674
00:48:15,772 --> 00:48:17,677
What are you doing
with your life?

675
00:48:17,678 --> 00:48:18,912
How did you get like this?

676
00:48:18,913 --> 00:48:21,913
You can't beat some
fucking loser like him?

677
00:48:21,914 --> 00:48:23,117
How can you call yourself...

678
00:48:37,132 --> 00:48:39,699
So, do you,
like, play at Wimbledon

679
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,263
or the US Open or what?

680
00:48:42,264 --> 00:48:44,897
Yeah, sometimes.
When I qualify.

681
00:48:46,135 --> 00:48:47,936
- Really?
- Yeah.

682
00:48:47,937 --> 00:48:49,738
What does that mean?

683
00:48:49,739 --> 00:48:54,112
Well, those big tournaments
usually have spots for 128 players.

684
00:48:54,113 --> 00:48:55,947
So if you're ranked
in the top 100,

685
00:48:55,948 --> 00:48:58,050
then you instantly get a spot,

686
00:48:58,051 --> 00:49:00,854
but everyone else has
to play a sort of, uh,

687
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:02,739
tournament before
the tournament.

688
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,624
- Okay.
- Some years I make it,

689
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:06,553
some years I don't.

690
00:49:06,554 --> 00:49:08,842
But, um, if I win this thing
in New Rochelle,

691
00:49:08,843 --> 00:49:11,132
my ranking will be
high enough for the Open.

692
00:49:12,096 --> 00:49:13,229
So, you'll get a spot?

693
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:16,236
I'll get a spot
in the qualifiers.

694
00:49:17,808 --> 00:49:20,009
Oh, okay.

695
00:49:20,809 --> 00:49:22,506
I told you tennis is boring.

696
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:24,777
No, really...

697
00:49:24,778 --> 00:49:26,743
It's, um, it's interesting.

698
00:49:26,744 --> 00:49:27,775
Excuse me.

699
00:49:29,313 --> 00:49:30,948
Can I get a tea
with some lemon?

700
00:49:30,949 --> 00:49:32,417
Coming right up.

701
00:49:37,587 --> 00:49:41,327
Uh, so, tell me
about real estate law.

702
00:49:43,327 --> 00:49:45,694
Uh, I don't know,
well, um...

703
00:49:46,669 --> 00:49:48,300
- My firm...
- Mm-hmm.

704
00:49:48,301 --> 00:49:50,973
Well, it's not my firm,
but the firm that I work for,

705
00:49:50,974 --> 00:49:52,971
we actually do something
called estate planning.

706
00:49:52,972 --> 00:49:54,670
Which is a little different.

707
00:49:54,671 --> 00:49:57,836
I used to do real estate law
with this firm in Hartsdale...

708
00:49:57,837 --> 00:49:59,089
which I don't know
if you know where that is

709
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:00,342
- but it's just five minutes...
- Thank you.

710
00:50:00,343 --> 00:50:01,760
...down the road
if you're driving,

711
00:50:01,761 --> 00:50:03,178
but, um, yeah,
I left that firm.

712
00:50:03,179 --> 00:50:05,677
It was small. Anyway.

713
00:50:05,678 --> 00:50:09,185
- Um, I deal with trusts and...
- Trust.

714
00:50:09,186 --> 00:50:11,268
...uh, power of attorney...

715
00:50:11,269 --> 00:50:13,352
Go ask them about the beds.

716
00:50:13,353 --> 00:50:14,819
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

717
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:16,428
Do you want us to wait
to FaceTime with Dad?

718
00:50:16,429 --> 00:50:18,667
No, no, it's okay.
Do you mind taking this upstairs for me?

719
00:50:18,668 --> 00:50:19,966
- Okay. Sure.
- Okay. Love you.

720
00:50:19,967 --> 00:50:21,030
- We'll be right up.
- All right, honey.

721
00:50:21,031 --> 00:50:22,299
All right, see you.

722
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,167
Anything that, you know,
you have to deal with

723
00:50:24,168 --> 00:50:27,043
when someone crosses over...

724
00:50:28,502 --> 00:50:30,507
- Are you okay?
- Huh?

725
00:50:30,508 --> 00:50:32,514
Are you... Are you okay?

726
00:50:32,515 --> 00:50:33,973
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

727
00:50:35,149 --> 00:50:37,515
Can you excuse me?
I just have to...

728
00:50:38,421 --> 00:50:39,421
Yeah.

729
00:50:47,392 --> 00:50:49,044
What the fuck
are you doing here?

730
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:50,697
I'm playing
at the Challenger.

731
00:50:50,698 --> 00:50:52,295
Yeah, I know that.

732
00:50:52,296 --> 00:50:54,164
But you're not staying here,
are you?

733
00:50:54,165 --> 00:50:56,631
No. Why are you staying here?

734
00:50:56,632 --> 00:50:58,833
I assumed you guys would
rent a villa or something.

735
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:01,209
Lily likes hotels.

736
00:51:03,404 --> 00:51:04,873
Our daughter.

737
00:51:04,874 --> 00:51:06,574
Oh.

738
00:51:06,575 --> 00:51:08,245
Art can't see us together.
He already thinks

739
00:51:08,246 --> 00:51:09,910
I planned this
to humiliate him.

740
00:51:11,381 --> 00:51:13,716
Didn't you?

741
00:51:14,459 --> 00:51:15,520
Not this part.

742
00:51:26,297 --> 00:51:27,896
Are you on a fucking date?

743
00:51:27,897 --> 00:51:29,198
No.

744
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:31,107
Well, yeah, but it's not...

745
00:51:32,777 --> 00:51:34,209
I just need
a place to sleep.

746
00:51:35,205 --> 00:51:36,205
- What?
- Wow.

747
00:51:36,206 --> 00:51:37,579
Can't all stay at the Ritz.

748
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:39,440
Mm. Okay, well.

749
00:51:39,441 --> 00:51:41,850
Can you seal the deal
and leave?

750
00:51:41,851 --> 00:51:43,516
You're on opposite sides
of the draw.

751
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,879
You're not gonna play each other unless
you're both in the final.

752
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,551
I don't think we have
to worry about that.

753
00:51:48,552 --> 00:51:51,292
No, you typically fall apart
in the second round.

754
00:51:55,823 --> 00:51:57,028
Your mom looks good.

755
00:51:57,029 --> 00:51:58,893
I know she does, Patrick.

756
00:52:05,106 --> 00:52:06,401
Do me a favor.

757
00:52:06,402 --> 00:52:08,001
Stay the fuck
away from us.

758
00:52:21,153 --> 00:52:22,521
Sorry, that was a, uh...

759
00:52:23,857 --> 00:52:24,985
Uh, hey...

760
00:52:31,992 --> 00:52:34,098
<i>Junior training sessions</i>

761
00:52:34,099 --> 00:52:36,205
<i>will now take place
on court six.</i>

762
00:52:41,209 --> 00:52:43,009
<i>Will Coach Stevens</i>

763
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:44,810
<i>please report to
the main office?</i>

764
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:46,105
<i>Coach Stevens.</i>

765
00:52:47,479 --> 00:52:49,245
What do you mean
you won't say?

766
00:52:49,246 --> 00:52:51,011
- I don't kiss and tell.
- Since when?

767
00:52:51,012 --> 00:52:53,618
Since she told me
she'd stop seeing me if I told anyone.

768
00:52:58,453 --> 00:52:59,690
And go!

769
00:53:00,955 --> 00:53:02,930
- Yep, yep, good.
- All right.

770
00:53:04,465 --> 00:53:06,366
Right, but she had to know
that you were gonna talk to me.

771
00:53:06,367 --> 00:53:08,036
She didn't indicate that
there were any exceptions.

772
00:53:08,037 --> 00:53:11,038
All right, fine.
Then give me a signal.

773
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,456
Isn't this hard
for you to hear?

774
00:53:12,457 --> 00:53:14,447
Like, wouldn't you
rather not?

775
00:53:14,448 --> 00:53:16,438
No. I'm very happy for you.

776
00:53:16,439 --> 00:53:18,043
I just don't wanna
feel left out.

777
00:53:21,851 --> 00:53:22,977
There you go!

778
00:53:26,251 --> 00:53:27,684
Okay, how about this?

779
00:53:27,685 --> 00:53:29,384
If the two of you slept together,
do a normal serve.

780
00:53:29,385 --> 00:53:30,991
- Art.
- I'm not asking

781
00:53:30,992 --> 00:53:33,190
you to tell me.
I'm just saying,

782
00:53:33,191 --> 00:53:35,024
if you fucked,
serve like me.

783
00:53:35,025 --> 00:53:36,859
- Like you?
- Yeah.

784
00:53:39,068 --> 00:53:40,967
You know you have
a tic, right?

785
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:42,866
Before you throw the ball up

786
00:53:42,867 --> 00:53:45,148
you place it in the exact center
of the neck of the racket.

787
00:53:53,612 --> 00:53:56,014
Okay, fine, yeah.
Do that. If you fucked.

788
00:53:56,015 --> 00:53:58,234
I'm not telling you
anything, Art.

789
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,454
You won't be telling me anything.
Come on.

790
00:55:25,605 --> 00:55:27,572
- Everything okay?
- I'm okay, thank you.

791
00:55:27,573 --> 00:55:29,541
- Excuse me, Tashi.
- No, it's okay.

792
00:55:37,847 --> 00:55:38,917
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

793
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:40,015
Of course.

794
00:55:46,186 --> 00:55:49,365
<i>Time. Second set.
Donaldson to serve.</i>

795
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:22,827
There you go!

796
00:56:37,625 --> 00:56:39,478
He's pretty funny.

797
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,216
He's, like,
always cracking jokes.

798
00:56:41,217 --> 00:56:43,017
It just sounds so hard.

799
00:56:43,018 --> 00:56:44,178
It's not.

800
00:56:45,588 --> 00:56:47,982
I don't know I feel,
like, out of all my classes...

801
00:56:47,983 --> 00:56:50,169
All right,
so when are you going pro?

802
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:52,357
Um, well,
if we win the championship,

803
00:56:52,358 --> 00:56:54,690
- then I'll leave.
- So, May.

804
00:56:54,691 --> 00:56:57,590
- I said, if we win.
- Right. So, May.

805
00:56:57,591 --> 00:57:00,167
Um...

806
00:57:00,168 --> 00:57:01,501
Did Patrick tell you
he's coming

807
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:04,371
- to the Pepperdine match?
- Hmm. Yeah, he told me.

808
00:57:04,372 --> 00:57:06,534
We should get dinner
or something.

809
00:57:06,535 --> 00:57:07,770
Sure. If you want.

810
00:57:10,979 --> 00:57:12,263
What's up?

811
00:57:12,264 --> 00:57:13,548
Nothing.

812
00:57:14,575 --> 00:57:15,649
Art.

813
00:57:18,049 --> 00:57:19,421
The whole thing you're doing,
you're not good at it.

814
00:57:19,422 --> 00:57:21,282
- It's fucking stupid.
- I'm not doing a thing.

815
00:57:21,283 --> 00:57:23,055
I'm just surprised that you guys are
still seeing each other.

816
00:57:23,056 --> 00:57:24,058
That's all.

817
00:57:27,921 --> 00:57:29,091
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

818
00:57:32,502 --> 00:57:34,668
Why did you ask me
to come to lunch with you?

819
00:57:35,767 --> 00:57:37,105
I told you,
I had extra meal credits

820
00:57:37,106 --> 00:57:38,370
and they were
going to expire.

821
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:39,619
Don't be such
a fucking pussy.

822
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:40,868
Is he seeing other girls
on tour?

823
00:57:40,869 --> 00:57:42,389
- No, I mean...
- Is that what this is?

824
00:57:43,343 --> 00:57:44,410
- I don't know.
- What?

825
00:57:44,411 --> 00:57:45,627
That's not what
I'm trying to say.

826
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:46,845
Then what are you
trying to say?

827
00:57:50,252 --> 00:57:51,619
Okay.

828
00:57:55,125 --> 00:57:56,448
He's not in love
with you.

829
00:58:06,132 --> 00:58:08,372
What makes you think
I want someone to be in love with me?

830
00:58:09,372 --> 00:58:10,669
Did I ever say I was
in love with him?

831
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:11,967
- You didn't.
- So why would I give a fuck

832
00:58:11,968 --> 00:58:13,568
- if he loved me or not?
- I guess you wouldn't.

833
00:58:13,569 --> 00:58:14,675
- Cool.
- Cool.

834
00:58:16,038 --> 00:58:17,225
Don't you think
you deserve it?

835
00:58:17,226 --> 00:58:18,412
Jesus fucking Christ.

836
00:58:18,413 --> 00:58:19,977
I mean, who wouldn't be
in love with you?

837
00:58:25,216 --> 00:58:26,755
Think you might be
the worst friend in the world.

838
00:58:26,756 --> 00:58:27,911
Maybe.

839
00:58:27,912 --> 00:58:29,019
Definitely!

840
00:58:30,358 --> 00:58:32,693
Thank you.
For lunch, Art.

841
00:58:43,372 --> 00:58:45,339
Whoo-hoo! Let's go!

842
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:47,507
Who the fuck is this guy?

843
00:58:47,508 --> 00:58:49,336
- Does he go here?
- I don't know.

844
00:58:49,337 --> 00:58:51,310
- I don't... I don't think so.
- Come on, Donaldson,

845
00:58:51,311 --> 00:58:52,581
big serve! Big serve!

846
00:58:57,846 --> 00:58:58,880
That's right, baby!

847
00:58:58,881 --> 00:59:00,380
Show that motherfucker
who's boss.

848
00:59:02,886 --> 00:59:04,758
Finish it up, Donaldson,
come on.

849
00:59:11,826 --> 00:59:12,865
Whoa!

850
00:59:13,664 --> 00:59:14,735
All right.

851
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:20,708
Come on. Come on. Come on.

852
00:59:24,276 --> 00:59:25,339
Art!

853
00:59:28,176 --> 00:59:29,215
Out of the way,
out of the way!

854
00:59:50,264 --> 00:59:51,706
So, how's the tour?

855
00:59:52,933 --> 00:59:54,038
No fun stuff?

856
00:59:54,736 --> 00:59:55,838
Like what?

857
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:57,608
I don't know.
Are you seeing anybody?

858
00:59:57,609 --> 00:59:59,907
What do you mean?
I'm taken.

859
00:59:59,908 --> 01:00:01,188
What do you think
I'm doing here?

860
01:00:07,753 --> 01:00:09,053
You're not here
to visit me?

861
01:00:12,291 --> 01:00:13,453
What?

862
01:00:18,633 --> 01:00:20,153
You're really committing
to this thing?

863
01:00:21,633 --> 01:00:23,202
- To Tashi?
- Hmm.

864
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:25,462
Yeah. I mean,

865
01:00:25,463 --> 01:00:27,500
we're taking it step by step,
but, you know...

866
01:00:28,506 --> 01:00:29,678
I like her.

867
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:33,814
I think she'd make me
an honest man.

868
01:00:37,652 --> 01:00:40,248
- You don't believe me?
- No, I'm just...

869
01:00:40,249 --> 01:00:43,489
I'm not sure how she's thinking
about all of this.

870
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:44,792
I don't want you
to get hurt.

871
01:00:47,218 --> 01:00:48,820
You don't want me to get hurt?

872
01:00:48,821 --> 01:00:49,863
Hmm.

873
01:00:53,162 --> 01:00:55,198
- Did she say something to you?
- No.

874
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:58,968
I just got the impression
she's not thinking

875
01:00:58,969 --> 01:01:01,875
about this as
a serious relationship.

876
01:01:03,213 --> 01:01:04,663
You got that impression?

877
01:01:04,664 --> 01:01:06,114
From a conversation we had.

878
01:01:06,115 --> 01:01:08,046
- Huh!
- Hmm.

879
01:01:12,782 --> 01:01:14,288
You fucking snake.

880
01:01:14,289 --> 01:01:16,515
Honestly, I'm proud of you.

881
01:01:16,516 --> 01:01:19,088
- I'd be doing the same thing.
- I'm not doing anything.

882
01:01:19,089 --> 01:01:21,730
It's fine. It's exciting
to see you this way.

883
01:01:22,995 --> 01:01:24,130
It's what's been missing
from your tennis.

884
01:01:24,131 --> 01:01:26,424
What?

885
01:01:26,425 --> 01:01:28,796
It's nice to see you
lit up about something.

886
01:01:28,797 --> 01:01:31,167
Even if that something
is my girlfriend.

887
01:01:31,168 --> 01:01:32,766
That's what the two of you
are calling each other now?

888
01:01:32,767 --> 01:01:34,531
Hmm.

889
01:01:34,532 --> 01:01:36,338
You know this makes
it hotter for me, right?

890
01:01:37,513 --> 01:01:39,445
You sitting here
pining for her.

891
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:40,613
I would never do anything

892
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:41,948
- to get in the way of you...
- I know.

893
01:01:41,949 --> 01:01:43,283
- ...and your girlfriend.
- I know.

894
01:01:43,284 --> 01:01:44,544
It's not your style.

895
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:47,646
You're playing
percentage tennis.

896
01:01:48,589 --> 01:01:49,890
Waiting for me to fuck up.

897
01:01:55,189 --> 01:01:56,930
Come on,
walk me over there.

898
01:02:39,441 --> 01:02:40,732
I missed you.

899
01:02:47,475 --> 01:02:49,745
You have any idea
how lonely it is on tour?

900
01:02:49,746 --> 01:02:51,344
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

901
01:02:51,345 --> 01:02:53,344
Is that why you haven't won
any challengers?

902
01:02:53,345 --> 01:02:55,219
I just told you I missed you.

903
01:03:12,169 --> 01:03:15,238
I watched
the Shinoda match online.

904
01:03:15,239 --> 01:03:16,970
And you could've won,
but then you started tanking

905
01:03:16,971 --> 01:03:18,308
in the third set.

906
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:21,479
- Tashi, come on.
- What?

907
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:22,609
Look at me.

908
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:25,749
When were you gonna
tell me about Art?

909
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:27,416
Thought you knew about that.

910
01:03:28,322 --> 01:03:29,517
I mean...

911
01:03:31,189 --> 01:03:33,625
I feel bad because
I know he's in pain,

912
01:03:33,626 --> 01:03:35,688
- but...
- Right, but?

913
01:03:37,293 --> 01:03:38,999
What? You're not
intimidated by him?

914
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:39,958
No.

915
01:03:39,959 --> 01:03:42,229
- Really?
- No.

916
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:44,499
- Well, you should be.
- Uh-huh. Why?

917
01:03:46,168 --> 01:03:47,942
- Because he's smart.
- Yeah.

918
01:03:48,841 --> 01:03:50,942
- He's good looking.
- Yeah.

919
01:03:50,943 --> 01:03:53,141
And he's really
fucking good at tennis.

920
01:03:53,142 --> 01:03:54,946
Oh, he's always
been very good.

921
01:03:54,947 --> 01:03:57,352
Yeah,
but he's gotten a lot better

922
01:03:57,353 --> 01:03:58,645
since he's been here.

923
01:04:00,054 --> 01:04:01,820
Are the two of us
still playing for your number?

924
01:04:01,821 --> 01:04:04,057
I thought I won.

925
01:04:05,329 --> 01:04:06,685
That's your problem.

926
01:04:06,686 --> 01:04:08,897
You always think you've won
before the match is over.

927
01:04:12,129 --> 01:04:13,561
Are we talking
about tennis?

928
01:04:15,463 --> 01:04:16,872
We're always
talking about tennis.

929
01:04:19,539 --> 01:04:20,667
Can we not?

930
01:04:27,348 --> 01:04:28,348
Sure.

931
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:34,716
What are you doing?

932
01:04:34,717 --> 01:04:36,613
I'm getting ready
for my match.

933
01:04:36,614 --> 01:04:39,026
Start my routine.
I'll see you there.

934
01:04:40,594 --> 01:04:42,062
- Tashi.
- What?

935
01:04:42,063 --> 01:04:43,631
If you're not interested
in me fixing your game for free,

936
01:04:43,632 --> 01:04:45,593
don't worry about it.
It's fine.

937
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:48,626
Why do you care so much?

938
01:04:48,627 --> 01:04:50,230
Well, we're dating, right?
So, I don't know.

939
01:04:50,231 --> 01:04:51,835
Should be a little embarrassing
if you suck.

940
01:04:51,836 --> 01:04:54,004
- I suck now?
- God.

941
01:04:54,005 --> 01:04:55,999
It's not college tennis
out there.

942
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,580
We can't all walk around
calling ourselves "The Duncanator."

943
01:04:59,581 --> 01:05:01,140
- Wow.
- I'm sorry. I just...

944
01:05:01,141 --> 01:05:03,310
Okay. No, it's fine.

945
01:05:03,311 --> 01:05:04,645
Look, I'm happy
they like you here.

946
01:05:04,646 --> 01:05:05,981
I just don't need you
to be my coach.

947
01:05:05,982 --> 01:05:07,417
Well, someone needs to be.

948
01:05:09,525 --> 01:05:10,756
Can we just start over?

949
01:05:10,757 --> 01:05:12,683
What do you think
you need from me?

950
01:05:12,684 --> 01:05:14,918
Honestly, what do you think
you need from me?

951
01:05:14,919 --> 01:05:17,458
A cheerleader? A girlfriend?
A fuck buddy?

952
01:05:17,459 --> 01:05:19,998
Like, there's plenty
of girls out here that would

953
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:21,896
love to be
your girlfriend, okay?

954
01:05:21,897 --> 01:05:23,599
You're charming.

955
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:26,120
You're talented, you got a big dick.
Just go be with one of them.

956
01:05:27,944 --> 01:05:29,559
Is this like,
a new strategy you're using

957
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,174
to pump yourself up
before the match?

958
01:05:31,175 --> 01:05:33,290
Have a little fight
to get the energy going?

959
01:05:33,291 --> 01:05:35,407
I don't need a fight
to get the energy going.

960
01:05:35,408 --> 01:05:37,180
No. Just an hour
of meditation.

961
01:05:37,181 --> 01:05:38,962
And what?
You think that's lame?

962
01:05:38,963 --> 01:05:40,988
I think it's unnecessary
given you're playing

963
01:05:40,989 --> 01:05:43,013
Sally Fucking Country Club
from Pepperdine.

964
01:05:43,014 --> 01:05:45,917
And how's coasting
by on talent going for you?

965
01:05:48,664 --> 01:05:50,311
You know
how ridiculous it is

966
01:05:50,312 --> 01:05:51,959
to hear you
call me every week,

967
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,869
talking about all the ways
that you're getting screwed over on tour?

968
01:05:54,870 --> 01:05:56,961
As if that's a good use
for my fucking time?

969
01:05:56,962 --> 01:06:00,767
- Well, excuse me for inconveniencing you.
- You are, actually.

970
01:06:00,768 --> 01:06:02,871
I need to be alone.
So can I just meet you there?

971
01:06:02,872 --> 01:06:04,741
- No.
- What?

972
01:06:04,742 --> 01:06:07,048
I'm not going to the match.
Not if you think you can just dismiss me.

973
01:06:07,049 --> 01:06:09,245
I'm not some fucking lapdog
who's gonna sit around

974
01:06:09,246 --> 01:06:11,562
and let you punish me.
I'm not Art.

975
01:06:11,563 --> 01:06:13,879
Or maybe you need
someone like that.

976
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,822
Someone who's gonna hop on board
and be Mr. Tashi Duncan.

977
01:06:16,823 --> 01:06:18,788
Is that what
you think I want?

978
01:06:18,789 --> 01:06:20,754
Yeah. A member
of the fan club.

979
01:06:25,967 --> 01:06:27,530
You're not a member
of my fan club?

980
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:31,905
I'm your peer.
I'm not your fucking groupie.

981
01:06:31,906 --> 01:06:33,437
And I'm definitely
not your student.

982
01:06:35,939 --> 01:06:36,939
All right.

983
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:41,340
Good luck, champ.

984
01:07:27,993 --> 01:07:29,629
- Come on.
- Hi.

985
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:31,024
- Sorry.
- Hi.

986
01:07:31,025 --> 01:07:32,067
Thank you.

987
01:07:34,027 --> 01:07:38,001
<i>And now, your 2002, 2005,</i>

988
01:07:38,002 --> 01:07:41,799
<i>and 2006 NCAA champion,</i>

989
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,039
<i>give it up for
Stanford Women's Tennis.</i>

990
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,707
Go Stanford!

991
01:07:46,283 --> 01:07:47,577
Hey!

992
01:07:49,414 --> 01:07:51,449
Tashi!

993
01:07:52,454 --> 01:07:54,221
Tashi!

994
01:07:57,056 --> 01:07:59,688
Tashi! We love you, Tashi!

995
01:08:04,467 --> 01:08:06,464
Yeah, whoo!

996
01:08:07,801 --> 01:08:09,203
Tashi!

997
01:08:10,903 --> 01:08:12,140
Yeah, let's go!

998
01:08:27,389 --> 01:08:30,551
<i>On court one,
Maria Foster from Pepperdine,</i>

999
01:08:30,552 --> 01:08:33,219
<i>and from Stanford,
Tashi Duncan.</i>

1000
01:08:40,727 --> 01:08:42,896
We love you, Tashi!

1001
01:09:48,298 --> 01:09:49,935
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

1002
01:09:57,576 --> 01:10:00,641
Okay, Tashi,
you're okay. You're okay.

1003
01:10:00,642 --> 01:10:02,811
out of the way!

1004
01:10:02,812 --> 01:10:04,982
On your back.
Okay, try to breathe.

1005
01:10:04,983 --> 01:10:06,553
Okay, you're okay.

1006
01:10:08,821 --> 01:10:10,753
Okay, okay, okay.

1007
01:10:12,755 --> 01:10:15,458
Look at me.
Tashi, look at me, okay?

1008
01:10:15,459 --> 01:10:17,643
Just breathe.
Just breathe. Breathe.

1009
01:10:17,644 --> 01:10:19,827
It's torn up pretty bad,

1010
01:10:19,828 --> 01:10:21,559
but we won't know for sure
until we get the X-rays

1011
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:22,694
from the hospital.

1012
01:10:22,695 --> 01:10:24,132
Did you see it happen?

1013
01:10:24,133 --> 01:10:25,569
Yeah, it was pretty quick.

1014
01:10:25,570 --> 01:10:28,568
Just a slip and then
she landed on it the wrong way.

1015
01:10:28,569 --> 01:10:30,235
That's all it takes.

1016
01:10:30,236 --> 01:10:33,776
Yeah. Let's just hope
it's not as bad as it looks.

1017
01:10:35,216 --> 01:10:36,810
Did you get an ETA
on the ambulance?

1018
01:10:36,811 --> 01:10:38,885
Yeah, they said
they're on their way.

1019
01:10:42,583 --> 01:10:43,815
- I'm sorry.
- Out.

1020
01:10:43,816 --> 01:10:45,521
- Listen, Tashi! Tashi...
- Get out! Out!

1021
01:10:45,522 --> 01:10:46,995
- Tashi, Tashi, listen, please.
- Out!

1022
01:10:46,996 --> 01:10:48,923
- Out!
- Patrick, get the fuck out!

1023
01:11:31,303 --> 01:11:32,669
Out!

1024
01:11:32,670 --> 01:11:34,037
Thirty, love.

1025
01:11:34,038 --> 01:11:35,490
That was out!

1026
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:36,942
That was way out!

1027
01:11:36,943 --> 01:11:39,078
The ball was called in.

1028
01:11:39,079 --> 01:11:40,446
- Are you blind?
- Zweig!

1029
01:11:40,447 --> 01:11:42,247
Are you here to do your job,
or you're just excited

1030
01:11:42,248 --> 01:11:43,913
that Art Donaldson's
over there?

1031
01:11:43,914 --> 01:11:46,710
I'm going to give you a code violation
if you don't stop this.

1032
01:11:46,711 --> 01:11:48,120
Hey, Art!

1033
01:11:48,121 --> 01:11:49,888
This lady wants
your autograph.

1034
01:11:53,084 --> 01:11:55,753
Code violation.
Unsportsmanlike conduct.

1035
01:11:55,754 --> 01:11:57,629
Point penalty, Zweig.

1036
01:11:59,161 --> 01:12:02,168
- Come on, Patrick!
- Just play the game.

1037
01:12:02,169 --> 01:12:03,797
This how you wanna
get your points?

1038
01:12:03,798 --> 01:12:06,335
- I'm ready to serve, Patrick.
- Yeah, I bet.

1039
01:12:06,336 --> 01:12:07,507
Forty, love.

1040
01:12:20,857 --> 01:12:22,555
Stop going easy on me.

1041
01:12:25,056 --> 01:12:26,119
I'm not.

1042
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:40,489
- Hit the ball!
- Tashi...

1043
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:42,509
Actually fucking
hit the ball.

1044
01:12:44,174 --> 01:12:45,174
Come on.

1045
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:49,417
You afraid you're
gonna hurt me?

1046
01:12:53,854 --> 01:12:54,854
Pussy.

1047
01:12:59,024 --> 01:13:00,024
Wait!

1048
01:13:05,228 --> 01:13:06,500
Okay?

1049
01:13:13,602 --> 01:13:15,003
And actually try to win.

1050
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:18,743
Please.

1051
01:13:40,862 --> 01:13:42,331
- Hey.
- I'm fine.

1052
01:13:42,332 --> 01:13:43,334
You okay?

1053
01:13:46,801 --> 01:13:47,841
I'm good.
I'm okay.

1054
01:14:01,482 --> 01:14:02,482
I'm fine.

1055
01:14:03,550 --> 01:14:04,550
I'm okay.

1056
01:14:05,255 --> 01:14:06,285
I'm fine.

1057
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:08,125
I'm okay.

1058
01:14:09,899 --> 01:14:11,526
Come here.

1059
01:14:11,527 --> 01:14:14,199
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1060
01:15:39,747 --> 01:15:40,918
More aggressive.

1061
01:15:45,423 --> 01:15:46,517
Little higher.

1062
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:48,596
More aggressive.

1063
01:15:58,569 --> 01:16:00,003
Just invite her to serve.

1064
01:16:06,174 --> 01:16:08,041
Oh, come on, you can
sleep in tomorrow, right?

1065
01:16:08,042 --> 01:16:09,696
Katerina's match
isn't until nighttime.

1066
01:16:09,697 --> 01:16:11,173
No. Are you kidding?

1067
01:16:11,174 --> 01:16:12,611
I wake her up early
to run drills.

1068
01:16:12,612 --> 01:16:14,048
Oh, she's lucky
to have you.

1069
01:16:14,049 --> 01:16:16,015
You're getting too much height

1070
01:16:16,016 --> 01:16:17,681
- on your ball toss.
- I am?

1071
01:16:17,682 --> 01:16:19,823
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- Whenever you guys are ready.

1072
01:16:19,824 --> 01:16:21,254
- Thanks.
- You're a great spot server,

1073
01:16:21,255 --> 01:16:24,391
but right now,
you're checking in at like 129, 130.

1074
01:16:24,392 --> 01:16:26,712
But I think with, like,
a few adjustments, you'd get to 135.

1075
01:16:29,099 --> 01:16:31,933
But you should listen to Karl.
He is your coach.

1076
01:16:31,934 --> 01:16:33,531
I'm just Katerina's
hitting partner.

1077
01:16:35,305 --> 01:16:38,613
Maybe you wanna jump ship?
Come be my assistant coach?

1078
01:16:39,741 --> 01:16:41,507
Oh, I get it.

1079
01:16:41,508 --> 01:16:44,284
You want to work with someone who has
a little bit more potential.

1080
01:16:44,285 --> 01:16:46,081
No! No.
No, it's not that.

1081
01:16:46,082 --> 01:16:48,216
I mean, you have plenty
of potential. It's just...

1082
01:16:49,458 --> 01:16:51,087
You think that would be
a good idea?

1083
01:16:51,993 --> 01:16:52,993
Why not?

1084
01:16:57,832 --> 01:17:00,126
- That was a long time ago.
- It was not that long ago.

1085
01:17:00,127 --> 01:17:01,793
Well, it feels like
a long time ago.

1086
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:06,905
So, you're saying you're not in love
with me anymore?

1087
01:17:11,776 --> 01:17:13,611
I'm really
proud of you, Tashi.

1088
01:17:13,612 --> 01:17:15,345
- I'm serious, I'm serious.
- Oh, God.

1089
01:17:15,346 --> 01:17:17,080
- You're doing really well.
- Okay.

1090
01:17:18,477 --> 01:17:20,296
What?
You think I was going to, like,

1091
01:17:20,297 --> 01:17:22,115
- kill myself after the injury?
- No.

1092
01:17:22,116 --> 01:17:23,988
No, I'm just glad
that you didn't quit tennis.

1093
01:17:25,354 --> 01:17:28,087
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
my only skill in life

1094
01:17:28,088 --> 01:17:29,458
is hitting a ball
with a racket.

1095
01:17:35,097 --> 01:17:37,529
This is really stupid,
but, uh...

1096
01:17:40,366 --> 01:17:41,973
After your injury...

1097
01:17:44,038 --> 01:17:45,471
I couldn't help but just...

1098
01:17:46,845 --> 01:17:49,282
think about what
would have happened

1099
01:17:49,283 --> 01:17:51,180
if I had beaten Patrick.

1100
01:17:53,119 --> 01:17:55,319
So you want me to join your team
because you feel guilty?

1101
01:17:56,057 --> 01:17:57,789
No.

1102
01:17:57,790 --> 01:17:59,826
I want you to join my team
because I want to win.

1103
01:18:02,962 --> 01:18:05,029
I think you'd beat him now
if you guys played.

1104
01:18:05,530 --> 01:18:06,833
Don't you think?

1105
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:09,737
Don't know.

1106
01:18:11,336 --> 01:18:12,366
We, uh...

1107
01:18:13,908 --> 01:18:17,442
haven't played professionally,
and don't keep in touch.

1108
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:19,260
What?

1109
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:21,078
Just...

1110
01:18:22,484 --> 01:18:24,851
I was a homewrecker,
wasn't I?

1111
01:18:31,556 --> 01:18:32,925
- Art.
- Yeah.

1112
01:18:35,889 --> 01:18:38,392
You never really said
if you're still in love with me or not.

1113
01:18:44,338 --> 01:18:45,498
Who wouldn't be?

1114
01:19:15,798 --> 01:19:16,903
What?

1115
01:19:21,976 --> 01:19:25,241
I really wanna
kiss you right now.

1116
01:19:27,712 --> 01:19:29,177
But I'm afraid if I try,

1117
01:19:29,178 --> 01:19:31,445
you'll think I'm the worst friend
in the world.

1118
01:19:42,955 --> 01:19:43,955
To who?

1119
01:20:16,664 --> 01:20:18,793
Oh, my...
Oh, my God!

1120
01:20:47,488 --> 01:20:49,355
Game and
second set, Donaldson.

1121
01:20:49,356 --> 01:20:51,194
Six-two. Match is tied.

1122
01:20:51,195 --> 01:20:53,235
One set all.

1123
01:20:55,735 --> 01:20:57,905
Code violation, racket abuse.

1124
01:20:58,572 --> 01:21:00,534
Point penalty, Zweig.

1125
01:21:02,410 --> 01:21:04,443
Please, please.

1126
01:21:08,548 --> 01:21:10,606
New balls, please.

1127
01:21:22,493 --> 01:21:25,527
He's not bad. I've played him
at a few of these things.

1128
01:21:25,528 --> 01:21:27,666
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be prostituting yourself

1129
01:21:27,667 --> 01:21:30,183
for a place
to sleep tonight?

1130
01:21:30,184 --> 01:21:32,699
I'm staying at
that girl's house.

1131
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:35,475
- Mm. Must be the love.
- Hey, come have a cigarette with me.

1132
01:21:35,476 --> 01:21:37,176
I have to talk to you.

1133
01:21:37,177 --> 01:21:40,343
Yeah, I don't smoke.
And I'm not talking to you.

1134
01:22:00,296 --> 01:22:01,696
I'm going to propose
something to you.

1135
01:22:01,697 --> 01:22:04,201
Can you blow it
away from me, please?

1136
01:22:04,202 --> 01:22:06,368
Sorry. It's gonna
make you angry.

1137
01:22:06,369 --> 01:22:08,536
It's gonna make you
very angry.

1138
01:22:13,714 --> 01:22:15,246
I want you to be my coach.

1139
01:22:18,319 --> 01:22:20,009
What?

1140
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:23,784
Even if he wins the Open,
completes his career Grand Slam,

1141
01:22:23,785 --> 01:22:28,092
Art's still gonna retire as someone
who's just really, really good.

1142
01:22:28,093 --> 01:22:30,593
That's what you guys
will have done together.

1143
01:22:30,594 --> 01:22:33,094
But imagine if you could turn
Patrick Zweig

1144
01:22:33,095 --> 01:22:34,793
into a guy who wins a Slam.

1145
01:22:36,329 --> 01:22:38,197
I still have a season.

1146
01:22:38,198 --> 01:22:39,739
I still have
one good season,

1147
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:41,503
and I need you
to bring it out of me.

1148
01:22:45,170 --> 01:22:46,170
So...

1149
01:22:47,812 --> 01:22:48,906
what do you think?

1150
01:22:50,147 --> 01:22:51,879
How fucking dare you?

1151
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:52,983
Jesus Christ!

1152
01:22:52,984 --> 01:22:54,546
You want my
best piece of advice?

1153
01:22:54,547 --> 01:22:55,949
- Do you want me to coach you?
- Yeah.

1154
01:22:55,950 --> 01:22:57,824
Okay, quit.

1155
01:22:57,825 --> 01:23:00,454
Quit right now.
Right the fuck now, quit.

1156
01:23:00,455 --> 01:23:02,224
You know that when I'm good,
I'm one of the best

1157
01:23:02,225 --> 01:23:03,456
- in the world.
- You are 271st best

1158
01:23:03,457 --> 01:23:05,154
- in the fucking world.
- I still have a shot.

1159
01:23:05,155 --> 01:23:07,432
You're 31. You have a better shot
with a handgun in your mouth.

1160
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:12,763
I mean,
why don't you go home?

1161
01:23:12,764 --> 01:23:15,065
Go home, ask your parents
for a seat on the board,

1162
01:23:15,066 --> 01:23:17,744
or you know what, matter of fact,
ask them for some money. Okay?

1163
01:23:17,745 --> 01:23:19,310
Go be like
any other spoiled kid

1164
01:23:19,311 --> 01:23:22,241
who has ever amounted to nothing
in their fucking life,

1165
01:23:22,242 --> 01:23:23,773
and stop this performance

1166
01:23:23,774 --> 01:23:25,443
of being
a down-on-your-luck professional.

1167
01:23:25,444 --> 01:23:26,744
- Tashi...
- No, you're not

1168
01:23:26,745 --> 01:23:28,681
20 years old anymore,
and it's not cute to be

1169
01:23:28,682 --> 01:23:30,519
walking around pretending
like you need to grind it out

1170
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:33,120
at these bum-fuck tournaments,
and sleep in your fucking car.

1171
01:23:33,121 --> 01:23:35,588
And it is unforgivable

1172
01:23:35,589 --> 01:23:37,860
that you would ask me
to devote a single second

1173
01:23:37,861 --> 01:23:39,624
of my fucking time

1174
01:23:39,625 --> 01:23:41,359
to help you achieve
your fucking dreams.

1175
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:43,136
What dreams, Patrick?

1176
01:23:43,802 --> 01:23:44,870
You never had any!

1177
01:23:44,871 --> 01:23:45,952
Is that what
you and Art are doing?

1178
01:23:45,953 --> 01:23:47,035
- Living the dream?
- That is exactly

1179
01:23:47,036 --> 01:23:48,556
what the fuck we're doing.

1180
01:23:48,557 --> 01:23:50,077
Then how come
you hate him?

1181
01:23:52,743 --> 01:23:54,213
You do.

1182
01:23:55,584 --> 01:23:57,640
It's obvious, you do.

1183
01:23:57,641 --> 01:23:58,984
You can feel him
giving up already,

1184
01:23:58,985 --> 01:24:00,799
even though you know
he's not going to retire

1185
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,477
- until you let him.
- He is a grown man.

1186
01:24:02,478 --> 01:24:04,900
- He can do whatever he wants.
- Sure, sure,

1187
01:24:04,901 --> 01:24:07,323
but he doesn't.
He does whatever you want.

1188
01:24:07,324 --> 01:24:10,290
Except now, he's not
even pretending to like it.

1189
01:24:10,291 --> 01:24:12,731
He's dreaming about

1190
01:24:12,732 --> 01:24:15,001
eating hamburgers again.

1191
01:24:15,002 --> 01:24:16,928
Watching your daughter, um...

1192
01:24:18,397 --> 01:24:19,897
Uh, Lily, grow up.

1193
01:24:19,898 --> 01:24:23,033
Maybe doing some commentary
on the Tennis Channel.

1194
01:24:25,042 --> 01:24:26,542
He's ready to be dead.

1195
01:24:28,607 --> 01:24:29,806
And you're starting to realize

1196
01:24:29,807 --> 01:24:31,249
you might not want
to be buried with him,

1197
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:34,352
'cause who is he to you
if he's not playing tennis?

1198
01:24:36,683 --> 01:24:38,521
So that's what
you think he is to me?

1199
01:24:39,562 --> 01:24:41,051
A racket and a dick.

1200
01:24:49,068 --> 01:24:50,698
Does Art know
about Atlanta?

1201
01:24:54,936 --> 01:24:57,474
You keep saying you came here
because Art needed matches.

1202
01:24:59,211 --> 01:25:01,038
I think you came
for something else.

1203
01:25:08,579 --> 01:25:09,915
You think
I came here for you?

1204
01:25:12,051 --> 01:25:15,261
You think I came here
to throw it all away for you?

1205
01:25:16,623 --> 01:25:18,165
Maybe you just
wanted to see me.

1206
01:25:18,930 --> 01:25:20,233
I have seen you.

1207
01:25:21,769 --> 01:25:22,961
You look like shit.

1208
01:25:25,905 --> 01:25:27,097
I'm going to beat him.

1209
01:25:30,572 --> 01:25:32,245
If we both
make it to the final.

1210
01:25:33,605 --> 01:25:35,572
I'm going to beat him.

1211
01:25:35,573 --> 01:25:37,107
Even if you could beat him,

1212
01:25:38,314 --> 01:25:39,813
it wouldn't change anything.

1213
01:25:42,121 --> 01:25:44,222
It'll break him.
You know it will.

1214
01:25:44,223 --> 01:25:47,260
It won't make you. Okay?
It's too late for that.

1215
01:25:53,827 --> 01:25:55,329
My number,
in case you change your mind

1216
01:25:55,330 --> 01:25:56,764
- about the coaching.
- I won't.

1217
01:26:27,994 --> 01:26:29,593
Just text me.
I'll meet you by the car.

1218
01:27:01,998 --> 01:27:02,998
Time.

1219
01:27:10,835 --> 01:27:13,238
Final set.
Zweig to serve.

1220
01:27:13,239 --> 01:27:14,712
Love, one.

1221
01:27:16,074 --> 01:27:18,114
- This is it!
- Keep it up, champ.

1222
01:27:20,756 --> 01:27:22,289
Come on, man!

1223
01:27:24,422 --> 01:27:26,557
Let's go, let's go, Artie.

1224
01:28:58,948 --> 01:29:01,278
Grab those!
Make sure that tent is secure.

1225
01:29:14,133 --> 01:29:15,373
Can you do me a favor?

1226
01:29:17,635 --> 01:29:20,198
Can you not, like,
demolish me tomorrow?

1227
01:29:23,602 --> 01:29:25,969
Hey, congrats on being

1228
01:29:25,970 --> 01:29:27,678
a Phil's Tire Town
Challenger finalist.

1229
01:29:28,817 --> 01:29:29,817
Yeah, you too.

1230
01:29:31,178 --> 01:29:32,844
Hopefully, the wind dies down
before tomorrow

1231
01:29:32,845 --> 01:29:34,380
and we can have
a fair fight.

1232
01:29:34,381 --> 01:29:35,548
Yeah.

1233
01:29:35,549 --> 01:29:38,670
Art. Come on.
Can we talk?

1234
01:29:38,671 --> 01:29:41,793
Can you put
your dick away?

1235
01:29:43,557 --> 01:29:44,860
This is a sauna.

1236
01:29:47,063 --> 01:29:49,059
Look, we've been here for a week
and we haven't said

1237
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:51,862
two words to each other.
It's just...

1238
01:29:51,863 --> 01:29:54,571
It's silly, man,
it's dramatic.

1239
01:29:54,572 --> 01:29:58,038
I mean, really,
why are you so angry with me?

1240
01:30:01,515 --> 01:30:03,746
Look, I don't buy
that it's because of Tashi,

1241
01:30:03,747 --> 01:30:05,880
or I don't think it's because
of what happened to her.

1242
01:30:05,881 --> 01:30:08,851
I think maybe you're still
just really disturbed

1243
01:30:08,852 --> 01:30:12,255
by the fact that she could've
been into someone like me.

1244
01:30:12,256 --> 01:30:14,021
When we were teenagers.

1245
01:30:16,128 --> 01:30:17,128
Huh!

1246
01:30:19,561 --> 01:30:22,164
When we were teenagers.

1247
01:30:22,165 --> 01:30:24,200
<i>...which will be
taking place tomorrow evening.</i>

1248
01:30:24,201 --> 01:30:25,734
<i>He has really been</i>

1249
01:30:25,735 --> 01:30:27,737
<i>in tip-top form this year,
hasn't he, Jason?</i>

1250
01:30:27,738 --> 01:30:29,099
<i>Yeah,
it's actually pretty remarkable</i>

1251
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:30,908
<i>the difference
we've seen in his game.</i>

1252
01:30:30,909 --> 01:30:33,906
<i>He's far and away the favorite right now
to win the US Open.</i>

1253
01:30:33,907 --> 01:30:35,611
<i>I completely agree.</i>

1254
01:30:35,612 --> 01:30:37,049
<i>And then, of course,
on the women's side</i>

1255
01:30:37,050 --> 01:30:38,373
<i>we have Anna Mueller,</i>

1256
01:30:38,374 --> 01:30:40,046
<i>who's already got
the Wimbledon title this year.</i>

1257
01:30:40,047 --> 01:30:41,983
<i>She's been having
a great season.</i>

1258
01:30:41,984 --> 01:30:43,920
<i>Absolutely incredible.</i>

1259
01:30:43,921 --> 01:30:46,590
<i>There just hasn't been
really anyone on the women's side</i>

1260
01:30:46,591 --> 01:30:48,454
<i>who can give her
much of a challenge.</i>

1261
01:30:48,455 --> 01:30:50,227
<i>In the case of Donaldson,
what do you think it is that...</i>

1262
01:31:36,605 --> 01:31:37,808
It's his grandmother's.

1263
01:31:41,344 --> 01:31:42,472
How is she?

1264
01:31:44,115 --> 01:31:45,145
She died.

1265
01:31:46,887 --> 01:31:47,887
Stroke.

1266
01:32:24,255 --> 01:32:25,350
I miss you.

1267
01:32:50,876 --> 01:32:52,711
You're right.

1268
01:32:52,712 --> 01:32:54,150
I do find it disturbing.

1269
01:32:54,151 --> 01:32:55,589
There's no need, man.

1270
01:32:57,192 --> 01:32:58,587
Lots of girls were into me.

1271
01:32:58,588 --> 01:33:00,922
None of them
wanted to marry me.

1272
01:33:00,923 --> 01:33:03,058
- That's not what I was for.
- What were you for?

1273
01:33:19,043 --> 01:33:20,204
<i>You're exactly right, Jason.</i>

1274
01:33:20,205 --> 01:33:22,013
<i>Just to back you up
a little bit...</i>

1275
01:33:22,014 --> 01:33:26,814
<i>His first serve last year was around 130,
which is excellent.</i>

1276
01:33:26,815 --> 01:33:31,614
<i>But now we're seeing him
get up to 135, 140 sometimes,</i>

1277
01:33:31,615 --> 01:33:33,957
<i>it's giving him a lot more
free points when he serves.</i>

1278
01:33:33,958 --> 01:33:36,459
<i>Yeah, it's just
little things like that...</i>

1279
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:38,423
Art? Mr. Donaldson?

1280
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:40,730
Oh, my God,
I can't believe my luck

1281
01:33:40,731 --> 01:33:42,860
that I would run
into you so late at night.

1282
01:33:42,861 --> 01:33:44,297
Um, would you, uh...

1283
01:33:45,997 --> 01:33:47,432
Sure, yeah.

1284
01:33:49,068 --> 01:33:50,234
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1285
01:33:50,235 --> 01:33:51,400
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1286
01:33:51,401 --> 01:33:53,206
<i>The edge
over the opponents.</i>

1287
01:33:53,207 --> 01:33:55,775
<i>That's often the difference
between a good player</i>

1288
01:33:55,776 --> 01:33:57,077
<i>and a great player.</i>

1289
01:33:57,078 --> 01:33:59,196
<i>And I think
Donaldson right now is</i>

1290
01:33:59,197 --> 01:34:01,314
<i>starting to look like
a great player.</i>

1291
01:34:01,315 --> 01:34:03,215
<i>That's for sure.
And I'll be very surprised</i>

1292
01:34:03,216 --> 01:34:04,886
<i>if he doesn't
come away tomorrow...</i>

1293
01:34:04,887 --> 01:34:06,752
Honestly,
I thought you'd be happy

1294
01:34:06,753 --> 01:34:08,320
I was in the draw.

1295
01:34:08,321 --> 01:34:11,397
I mean, you always wanted
to beat me in a tournament,

1296
01:34:11,398 --> 01:34:12,926
and a few weeks
before the Open,

1297
01:34:12,927 --> 01:34:14,797
that's the perfect
confidence booster.

1298
01:34:14,798 --> 01:34:16,546
I know what you're
trying to do right now.

1299
01:34:16,547 --> 01:34:18,489
I'm not trying
to do anything, Art.

1300
01:34:18,490 --> 01:34:20,431
This is a challenger.
I don't need to play

1301
01:34:20,432 --> 01:34:22,506
- mind games with you.
- Right. You don't give a shit.

1302
01:34:22,507 --> 01:34:24,535
I... Hey, I didn't say that.

1303
01:34:26,845 --> 01:34:28,775
We both know you have
considerably more

1304
01:34:28,776 --> 01:34:30,310
at stake here than I do.

1305
01:34:31,813 --> 01:34:33,280
Do I?

1306
01:34:36,821 --> 01:34:39,554
What the...
Oh, fuck, where do get

1307
01:34:39,555 --> 01:34:42,287
your swagger from, man?

1308
01:34:42,288 --> 01:34:44,663
I mean, you come in here
swinging your dick around

1309
01:34:44,664 --> 01:34:47,159
like I'm supposed
to be afraid of it, but...

1310
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:49,467
Do you realize
how embarrassing it is

1311
01:34:49,468 --> 01:34:51,834
that you are here
right now?

1312
01:34:51,835 --> 01:34:53,866
Not quite as embarrassing
as you being here.

1313
01:34:53,867 --> 01:34:55,467
I'm just stopping by, man.

1314
01:34:56,508 --> 01:34:57,909
This is where you live.

1315
01:35:02,215 --> 01:35:04,376
You know...

1316
01:35:04,377 --> 01:35:07,382
I always tried to figure out
what happened to you,

1317
01:35:07,383 --> 01:35:10,388
but, you know, the more
I've thought about it,

1318
01:35:10,389 --> 01:35:12,490
the more I realize...

1319
01:35:12,491 --> 01:35:14,486
It's what didn't happen.

1320
01:35:15,262 --> 01:35:17,060
You never grew up.

1321
01:35:17,061 --> 01:35:19,895
You still think you can talk to me
like you're my peer,

1322
01:35:19,896 --> 01:35:22,396
because we came
from the same place.

1323
01:35:22,397 --> 01:35:25,266
But it's not about where you come from
in tennis, Patrick.

1324
01:35:26,406 --> 01:35:27,406
It's about winning.

1325
01:35:28,374 --> 01:35:30,601
And I do. A lot.

1326
01:35:34,042 --> 01:35:37,047
- You've never beaten me.
- So what?

1327
01:35:37,048 --> 01:35:40,380
I haven't beaten most of the guys
who play at these things.

1328
01:35:40,381 --> 01:35:43,086
This is a game about winning
the points that matter.

1329
01:35:46,117 --> 01:35:47,288
I don't matter?

1330
01:35:51,732 --> 01:35:53,661
Not even to the most
obsessive tennis fan

1331
01:35:53,662 --> 01:35:55,263
in the entire world.

1332
01:35:58,638 --> 01:36:00,069
We're not talking
about tennis.

1333
01:36:00,070 --> 01:36:02,270
What the fuck else do I have
to talk to you about?

1334
01:36:13,219 --> 01:36:15,987
I wanted to come in here
and wish you luck, Art.

1335
01:36:21,725 --> 01:36:23,894
That makes no sense.

1336
01:36:23,895 --> 01:36:25,964
I wanted to say that
I'm looking forward to it.

1337
01:36:27,930 --> 01:36:29,429
And I miss playing with you.

1338
01:36:33,965 --> 01:36:34,965
Yeah.

1339
01:36:37,276 --> 01:36:39,040
Hmm.

1340
01:36:39,041 --> 01:36:42,442
Well, I don't miss
playing with you, man.

1341
01:36:43,483 --> 01:36:44,917
I'm too old for it.

1342
01:36:53,922 --> 01:36:55,520
Kiss for me.

1343
01:36:55,521 --> 01:36:57,120
Thank you. And Grandma.

1344
01:36:57,121 --> 01:36:58,456
Mwah!

1345
01:36:58,457 --> 01:36:59,896
- Thanks, sweetheart
- Good night, honey.

1346
01:36:59,897 --> 01:37:01,992
All right,
tuck you both in.

1347
01:37:01,993 --> 01:37:03,897
Oh, there we go.

1348
01:37:03,898 --> 01:37:05,696
Night, sweetheart.

1349
01:37:11,203 --> 01:37:12,208
Good night.

1350
01:37:14,105 --> 01:37:15,341
Thank you.

1351
01:37:15,342 --> 01:37:16,848
What time you want me
to come get her tomorrow?

1352
01:37:16,849 --> 01:37:19,441
I'm saying, whenever,
whenever you want to

1353
01:37:19,442 --> 01:37:20,609
'cause she can
stay with Andrew

1354
01:37:20,610 --> 01:37:21,945
- while we're doing warm-ups.
- Okay, hon.

1355
01:37:21,946 --> 01:37:23,282
And you're talking
to Ralph in the morning?

1356
01:37:23,283 --> 01:37:24,922
Oh, thank...
Yes, I do. I have that.

1357
01:37:24,923 --> 01:37:27,254
- Okay. Thank you, Mom.
- Okay, sleep tight, okay?

1358
01:37:27,255 --> 01:37:28,752
- I love you.
- I love you, sweetie.

1359
01:37:28,753 --> 01:37:30,463
- Have you... Do you have it?
- Okay, got my key.

1360
01:37:30,464 --> 01:37:32,088
- Yes, I do. Bye-bye.
- Okay.

1361
01:37:32,089 --> 01:37:33,130
Good night.

1362
01:38:26,444 --> 01:38:27,877
Tell me it doesn't matter.

1363
01:38:33,223 --> 01:38:36,358
Tell me it doesn't matter
if I win tomorrow.

1364
01:38:40,531 --> 01:38:41,531
No.

1365
01:38:45,229 --> 01:38:48,271
You tell me if it matters.
You're the professional competitor, Art.

1366
01:38:50,702 --> 01:38:52,605
It can't be about
avoiding my judgment.

1367
01:38:55,376 --> 01:38:56,773
I'm not a nun.
I'm not your mommy.

1368
01:38:56,774 --> 01:38:59,046
I'm just asking that you love me
no matter what.

1369
01:38:59,047 --> 01:39:00,945
What am I, Jesus?

1370
01:39:00,946 --> 01:39:02,054
Yeah.

1371
01:39:08,561 --> 01:39:09,561
You can beat him.

1372
01:39:11,729 --> 01:39:12,889
What if I don't?

1373
01:39:14,393 --> 01:39:15,525
How are you
gonna look at me

1374
01:39:15,526 --> 01:39:17,729
if I still can't beat
Patrick Zweig?

1375
01:39:20,936 --> 01:39:22,107
Just like this.

1376
01:39:34,349 --> 01:39:36,081
I'm going to
say something.

1377
01:39:36,082 --> 01:39:37,815
It's probably gonna
make you angry.

1378
01:39:40,355 --> 01:39:42,259
I need you to
hear me out, okay?

1379
01:39:47,432 --> 01:39:50,795
I wanna retire this year
whether we win the Open or not.

1380
01:39:54,497 --> 01:39:56,042
I'm still going to go for it.

1381
01:39:58,470 --> 01:40:00,178
I'm still going to try, but...

1382
01:40:03,978 --> 01:40:05,183
I'm tired.

1383
01:40:10,190 --> 01:40:12,789
I don't want to be one of those guys
who doesn't know

1384
01:40:12,790 --> 01:40:14,486
when to walk away, okay?

1385
01:40:14,487 --> 01:40:16,286
It's embarrassing
to still be doing this shit

1386
01:40:16,287 --> 01:40:17,459
when you're 40.

1387
01:40:22,303 --> 01:40:23,498
Okay.

1388
01:40:25,735 --> 01:40:28,306
Okay?

1389
01:40:28,307 --> 01:40:30,709
If you wanna quit playing tennis,
you can quit playing tennis.

1390
01:40:30,710 --> 01:40:32,705
You don't need
my permission.

1391
01:40:57,332 --> 01:40:59,464
We've been
doing this together.

1392
01:40:59,465 --> 01:41:01,483
We've always been
doing this together.

1393
01:41:01,484 --> 01:41:03,462
I'm your coach.
Okay, I work for you.

1394
01:41:03,463 --> 01:41:05,441
- Coach me then.
- I am coaching you.

1395
01:41:08,850 --> 01:41:10,875
I'm playing
for both of us, Tashi.

1396
01:41:12,244 --> 01:41:13,548
I know that.

1397
01:41:21,721 --> 01:41:23,558
If you don't win tomorrow,
I'll leave you.

1398
01:41:28,361 --> 01:41:30,670
I'm serious.
Does that help you?

1399
01:43:35,395 --> 01:43:39,496
Can you just hold me
until I fall asleep, please?

1400
01:43:48,432 --> 01:43:49,440
Okay.

1401
01:46:16,351 --> 01:46:18,523
Advantage, Donaldson.

1402
01:46:31,963 --> 01:46:34,173
Game, Donaldson.

1403
01:46:34,174 --> 01:46:37,735
Donaldson leads
six games to five.

1404
01:47:02,132 --> 01:47:05,568
<i>Phil's Tire Town reminds you
to drink some water.</i>

1405
01:47:05,569 --> 01:47:08,034
<i>Beverages are available
at the snack bar.</i>

1406
01:47:24,081 --> 01:47:25,379
What are you doing?

1407
01:47:25,380 --> 01:47:27,100
I told him you're an Uber driver.
Just drive.

1408
01:47:53,077 --> 01:47:54,475
I don't wanna be
parked here long.

1409
01:47:54,476 --> 01:47:55,978
Someone's gonna think
I'm a hooker and call the cops.

1410
01:47:55,979 --> 01:47:57,112
We can go back
to my hotel.

1411
01:47:57,113 --> 01:47:58,496
The money just came in
this afternoon.

1412
01:47:58,497 --> 01:47:59,881
I am not here
to fuck you, Patrick.

1413
01:47:59,882 --> 01:48:00,991
- You're not?
- No.

1414
01:48:00,992 --> 01:48:02,022
Uh.

1415
01:48:03,030 --> 01:48:04,926
Well?

1416
01:48:09,994 --> 01:48:11,629
I want you
to lose tomorrow.

1417
01:48:11,630 --> 01:48:13,000
I'm aware of that.

1418
01:48:16,001 --> 01:48:18,434
I'm asking you
to lose tomorrow.

1419
01:48:26,710 --> 01:48:27,710
Fuck off.

1420
01:48:29,488 --> 01:48:31,815
He's doing really well
this week.

1421
01:48:31,816 --> 01:48:32,917
He's ready to come back.

1422
01:48:32,918 --> 01:48:34,183
He's ready to
make a shot at the Open,

1423
01:48:34,184 --> 01:48:36,104
and if he wins tomorrow,
he'll know he can do it.

1424
01:48:37,228 --> 01:48:38,128
He needs this.

1425
01:48:38,129 --> 01:48:39,995
- He needs this?
- Yes.

1426
01:48:41,794 --> 01:48:43,129
What about what I need?

1427
01:48:45,462 --> 01:48:47,969
I can't believe
you'd do this to him.

1428
01:48:48,842 --> 01:48:49,971
I mean,

1429
01:48:51,168 --> 01:48:52,988
fucking me
would be one thing,

1430
01:48:52,989 --> 01:48:54,808
but this?
This is unforgivable.

1431
01:48:54,809 --> 01:48:56,379
Actually, I'm being
incredibly fucking kind

1432
01:48:56,380 --> 01:48:57,880
to the both of you right now.

1433
01:48:57,881 --> 01:49:00,553
Okay? I'm taking such good care
of my little white boys.

1434
01:49:02,056 --> 01:49:03,849
No. No fucking way.

1435
01:49:03,850 --> 01:49:05,870
Drive me back
to my fucking hotel.

1436
01:49:05,871 --> 01:49:07,890
Drive the fucking car, Patrick.

1437
01:49:07,891 --> 01:49:09,187
Hey, you know what the most
frustrating part of this is?

1438
01:49:09,188 --> 01:49:10,723
- What?
- You know what really drives me crazy?

1439
01:49:10,724 --> 01:49:12,022
You did come here to fuck me,

1440
01:49:12,023 --> 01:49:13,321
but you're so full of shit

1441
01:49:13,322 --> 01:49:15,197
that you won't
even admit that to yourself.

1442
01:49:15,198 --> 01:49:17,918
If it's the only way to get you to throw
the fucking match, then sure.

1443
01:49:18,434 --> 01:49:19,984
Go fuck yourself.

1444
01:49:19,985 --> 01:49:21,443
You absolute loser.

1445
01:49:21,444 --> 01:49:22,901
I'm the loser?

1446
01:49:22,902 --> 01:49:25,139
Yeah. Yeah, you are.
Look at you.

1447
01:49:25,140 --> 01:49:27,540
Time for your Uber driver
to drop you back off to your family.

1448
01:49:41,687 --> 01:49:42,687
Thirty, love.

1449
01:49:45,231 --> 01:49:46,231
Come on, Art.

1450
01:49:51,372 --> 01:49:53,903
- Unbelievable.
- I know. Let's go!

1451
01:50:11,488 --> 01:50:12,658
Fuck it. I'll do it.

1452
01:50:14,922 --> 01:50:16,086
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

1453
01:50:16,087 --> 01:50:17,253
Because I want you
to actually do it,

1454
01:50:17,254 --> 01:50:19,096
so I need to know
that you understand why...

1455
01:50:19,097 --> 01:50:21,194
I'm not married to you, Tashi.
Just be happy I'm doing what you want

1456
01:50:21,195 --> 01:50:23,464
- and shut up about it.
- You are such a fucking child.

1457
01:50:23,465 --> 01:50:25,131
Of course I am.

1458
01:50:25,132 --> 01:50:27,904
I spent my entire life
hitting a ball with a racket.

1459
01:50:29,508 --> 01:50:32,070
Why the fuck
am I in your car?

1460
01:50:32,071 --> 01:50:33,535
- Because you're stupid.
- You're stupid.

1461
01:50:33,536 --> 01:50:36,124
I know. I'm just not
as disturbed by it as you are.

1462
01:50:36,125 --> 01:50:38,713
I don't have nearly that
high an opinion of myself.

1463
01:50:38,714 --> 01:50:40,309
You are the most
egotistical person

1464
01:50:40,310 --> 01:50:42,195
- I have ever met in my life.
- Oh, sure, sure.

1465
01:50:42,196 --> 01:50:44,081
But I've never been
confused about the fact

1466
01:50:44,082 --> 01:50:45,785
that I'm a piece of shit.

1467
01:50:45,786 --> 01:50:47,002
That's what you like
about me.

1468
01:50:47,003 --> 01:50:48,218
I don't like
anything about you.

1469
01:50:48,219 --> 01:50:49,654
No, you like precisely
one thing about me

1470
01:50:49,655 --> 01:50:51,090
and it's that
I'm such a piece of shit

1471
01:50:51,091 --> 01:50:52,922
that I could actually see you
for what you are.

1472
01:50:52,923 --> 01:50:54,861
And what is that?

1473
01:50:54,862 --> 01:50:56,801
In reality? A really,

1474
01:50:58,668 --> 01:51:00,495
really insanely hot woman.

1475
01:51:00,496 --> 01:51:03,267
- Oh, fuck off.
- I guess now you'd say a MILF.

1476
01:51:03,268 --> 01:51:05,003
- Pull over.
- Come on, don't be dramatic.

1477
01:51:05,004 --> 01:51:06,590
Pull the fucking
car over, Patrick.

1478
01:51:06,591 --> 01:51:08,178
- Fine, let me... Fine.
- Pull over.

1479
01:51:18,117 --> 01:51:21,185
Hey! Hey!
Your hotel's that way!

1480
01:51:39,304 --> 01:51:41,406
Are you gonna
hit me again, huh?

1481
01:55:06,513 --> 01:55:08,448
<i>I miss
watching you play, Tashi.</i>

1482
01:55:09,918 --> 01:55:11,550
<i>You're so beautiful.</i>

1483
01:55:14,291 --> 01:55:16,720
You have to make him feel
like he earned it tomorrow.

1484
01:55:19,065 --> 01:55:21,395
You can't just give up
in the middle of the match.

1485
01:55:24,595 --> 01:55:26,532
Are you sure
this is what you want?

1486
01:55:30,367 --> 01:55:31,801
What else could I want?

1487
01:55:41,417 --> 01:55:43,780
How am I supposed to know
if you're going to do it?

1488
01:55:46,491 --> 01:55:47,652
You won't.

1489
01:56:03,138 --> 01:56:04,540
- All right.
- Come on!

1490
01:56:38,639 --> 01:56:40,719
Thirty, forty.

1491
01:56:48,956 --> 01:56:50,880
- All right.
- Hang in there.

1492
01:56:52,382 --> 01:56:53,520
Let's go!

1493
01:56:55,725 --> 01:56:58,124
- Yes, that's it, that's it!
- Come on, Patrick.

1494
01:56:58,125 --> 01:56:59,995
Yes, yes, the deuce!

1495
01:56:59,996 --> 01:57:01,436
- All right!
- Yes!

1496
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:23,584
Donaldson! Let's go!

1497
01:57:23,585 --> 01:57:25,689
Blame it on the court!

1498
01:57:25,690 --> 01:57:27,587
Whoo!

1499
01:57:54,514 --> 01:57:56,178
Fault!

1500
01:58:02,752 --> 01:58:04,228
Come on, get back in it.

1501
01:58:07,359 --> 01:58:10,102
No! Zweig!

1502
01:58:20,870 --> 01:58:23,148
- Come on!
- Whoo, whoo!

1503
01:58:55,609 --> 01:58:57,743
Come on, Patrick, let's play!

1504
01:59:32,876 --> 01:59:35,331
Time violation.
Warning, Zweig.

1505
02:00:53,699 --> 02:00:54,862
Deuce!

1506
02:01:32,268 --> 02:01:34,339
Fuck off!

1507
02:01:35,769 --> 02:01:38,238
Code violation,
audible obscenity.

1508
02:01:38,239 --> 02:01:40,345
Point penalty, Donaldson.

1509
02:01:41,409 --> 02:01:42,743
Advantage, Zweig.

1510
02:02:12,810 --> 02:02:13,972
Art?

1511
02:02:18,675 --> 02:02:20,044
He can serve.

1512
02:02:20,977 --> 02:02:22,578
You need to
get into position.

1513
02:02:26,126 --> 02:02:27,854
Come on, Art.
Let's go!

1514
02:02:40,635 --> 02:02:42,473
Serve.

1515
02:03:02,857 --> 02:03:04,924
Game, Zweig.

1516
02:03:05,998 --> 02:03:07,993
Final set, tie break.

1517
02:03:15,768 --> 02:03:17,131
Come on,
let's do this.

1518
02:03:17,132 --> 02:03:20,236
Let's close it out.
Let's close it out, baby.

1519
02:06:55,488 --> 02:06:56,958
Come on!

1520
02:06:59,999 --> 02:07:01,424
Ah!
