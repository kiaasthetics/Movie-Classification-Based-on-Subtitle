1
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,318
<i>Anastasia, I vow to
love you faithfully</i>

2
00:00:51,353 --> 00:00:53,403
<i>forsaking all others.</i>

3
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,061
<i>I promise to love, to trust</i>

4
00:00:57,097 --> 00:00:59,171
<i>and to respect you.</i>

5
00:00:59,206 --> 00:01:03,039
<i>To comfort you in times of
need and keep you safe.</i>

6
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:08,032
<i>All that I have
is now yours.</i>

7
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:10,473
<i>Fifty shades freed.</i>

8
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,090
<i>I give you my hand to my heart.</i>

9
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,819
<i>For as long as we both shall live.</i>

10
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:24,813
Christian, I vow to be
your faithful partner

11
00:01:24,874 --> 00:01:27,427
in sickness and health,
I promise

12
00:01:27,463 --> 00:01:30,355
to love you unconditionally.

13
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,016
To honor and respect you.

14
00:01:33,278 --> 00:01:36,179
To bring you solace
in times of need.

15
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:39,154
I promise to cherish you

16
00:01:39,995 --> 00:01:42,168
as long as we both shall live.

17
00:01:42,673 --> 00:01:46,313
<i>I now pronounce you
man and wife.</i>

18
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:48,043
You may kiss the bride.

19
00:02:40,354 --> 00:02:41,850
Mrs. Gray?

20
00:02:42,051 --> 00:02:44,145
That's me.

21
00:02:44,181 --> 00:02:46,132
Yeah, you.

22
00:02:46,611 --> 00:02:49,930
Let's get out of here.

23
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,688
You own this?

24
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:20,401
We own this.

25
00:03:22,544 --> 00:03:25,327
Mrs. Grey, Mr. Grey.

26
00:05:11,764 --> 00:05:14,109
<i>I didn't sleep last night.</i>

27
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:18,540
<i>Don't count on any tonight either.</i>

28
00:05:20,882 --> 00:05:23,019
Will you put some of
this in my back?

29
00:05:23,054 --> 00:05:24,710
If you insist.

30
00:05:30,452 --> 00:05:32,998
- Take off the whole thing.
- Not a chance.

31
00:05:33,654 --> 00:05:36,556
- Why?
- You're showing plenty as it is.

32
00:05:39,395 --> 00:05:41,724
I am wearing more
than any woman here.

33
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,575
You want to be goggle by every

34
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:44,795
guy in the beach...
Including Taylor?

35
00:05:47,942 --> 00:05:50,115
When's Taylor gonna get a vacation?

36
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,619
We need security.

37
00:05:51,638 --> 00:05:54,113
- On the beach, why?
- Because we do.

38
00:05:55,499 --> 00:05:57,092
You are done.

39
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,353
I'm gonna go for a swim.
You coming?

40
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,079
I'm right behind you.

41
00:06:22,638 --> 00:06:25,232
Here you go sir.

42
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,303
<i>"Access granted"</i>

43
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:10,876
What the hell are you doing?

44
00:07:12,072 --> 00:07:14,758
I must have turned over in my sleep.

45
00:07:14,794 --> 00:07:16,461
Yeah, it's not funny.

46
00:07:16,497 --> 00:07:19,021
Come on,
it's a little funny.

47
00:07:21,222 --> 00:07:23,382
Christian, look around. There is nothing

48
00:07:23,582 --> 00:07:25,417
but boobs for as far as I can see.

49
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:27,526
Boobs in boob land.

50
00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:29,766
Nobody cares about mine.

51
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:32,902
They will when they are on the
cover of some sleazy tabloid.

52
00:07:32,903 --> 00:07:34,151
Alright?

53
00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:36,684
We are going back to the boat.

54
00:08:06,117 --> 00:08:10,073
You insist on defying me Mrs. Grey.

55
00:08:11,595 --> 00:08:13,708
What should I do about that?

56
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:16,701
Learn to live with it.

57
00:08:16,703 --> 00:08:18,893
It's not my style.

58
00:08:21,803 --> 00:08:24,162
How come you
always braid my hair?

59
00:08:24,398 --> 00:08:25,399
Hush.

60
00:08:26,018 --> 00:08:28,506
Do you remember
your safe word?

61
00:08:29,907 --> 00:08:32,844
- Purple.
- Anna.

62
00:08:33,884 --> 00:08:35,072
Red.

63
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:37,633
Good.

64
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:39,661
Lift up your arms.

65
00:09:01,413 --> 00:09:04,116
Tomorrow I'm gonna call this deal.

66
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:38,829
Don't pull.
Don't bite.

67
00:10:00,096 --> 00:10:03,641
- Do you love me?
- You know, I love you.

68
00:10:05,827 --> 00:10:10,398
- Then why do you defy me?
- Because I can.

69
00:10:25,457 --> 00:10:28,113
I should misbehave more often.

70
00:10:28,148 --> 00:10:30,184
Yeah, maybe you should.

71
00:10:33,518 --> 00:10:34,572
Hey Ross. What's up?

72
00:10:34,773 --> 00:10:36,986
I'm sorry to interrupt
your honeymoon.

73
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:39,264
We had a fire in the main
server room this morning.

74
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:40,450
Was any one injured?

75
00:10:40,551 --> 00:10:42,103
No, and the damage could
have been much worse.

76
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:44,398
The fire suppressant system kicked in.

77
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:46,002
It looks like Arsen.

78
00:10:46,038 --> 00:10:48,178
Someone planted an explosive device.

79
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:53,007
This guy... Security is sweeping
the room for fingerprints and DNA.

80
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:54,083
Did he get any data?

81
00:10:54,284 --> 00:10:56,042
He took some of your personal files

82
00:10:56,243 --> 00:10:58,654
and then he might have set
the fire to cover his tracks.

83
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:00,204
Can you go back?

84
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,831
Oh, my God.
That's Jack.

85
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:08,278
- Who's Jack?
- Jack Hyde

86
00:11:08,314 --> 00:11:10,992
- A formerly of SIP.
- He was my boss.

87
00:11:11,028 --> 00:11:13,056
Not any more,
he's been dealt with.

88
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:16,163
I'm sorry, we need to go home.

89
00:11:16,198 --> 00:11:19,728
Ross, can you tell Andrea I need
the jet in Nise tomorrow please?

90
00:11:20,198 --> 00:11:23,852
- Got it. I'm sorry, Mrs. Gray
- Oh, don't be.

91
00:11:31,427 --> 00:11:33,757
Why would Jack do that?
It's insane.

92
00:11:36,494 --> 00:11:37,603
What?

93
00:11:37,638 --> 00:11:38,929
I got a report from the FAA,

94
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,849
they don't think that the
helicopter crash was an accident.

95
00:11:42,364 --> 00:11:44,367
They said it looks like sabotage.

96
00:11:44,402 --> 00:11:46,571
Sabotage? Why wouldn't
you tell me that?

97
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:47,669
I didn't want you to worry.

98
00:11:47,888 --> 00:11:49,355
You think Jack did that too?

99
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:50,880
Why would he be
going with these links?

100
00:11:51,365 --> 00:11:52,810
I don't know.

101
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,770
But don't worry.

102
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:59,721
I swear to keep you safe,
and I will.

103
00:12:03,553 --> 00:12:06,287
Ana, it's not funny.

104
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,873
- Hey.
- Oh, uh.

105
00:12:10,047 --> 00:12:12,633
Mr. and Mrs. Gray, welcome home.

106
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:14,997
- Hi, Gail.
- Sawyer, Ma'am.

107
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:17,209
- Hello, hi.
- This is my colleague, Prescott.

108
00:12:17,244 --> 00:12:19,488
Just Sawyer and Prescott.
That's it?

109
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:20,837
Keep it simple.

110
00:12:20,872 --> 00:12:22,984
They will be in charge of
your personal security.

111
00:12:23,556 --> 00:12:26,279
Oh, both of you?

112
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,246
We'll mostly take turns, Mrs Grey.

113
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:29,939
You will not even know we are here.

114
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,276
That seems unlikely,

115
00:12:31,311 --> 00:12:33,226
but thank you.

116
00:12:33,991 --> 00:12:36,334
Can I get you something to eat
before I unpack your bags?

117
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,789
I'm good.
Anastasia?

118
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:42,536
- Some tea perhaps?
- Yeah, yes. Thank you.

119
00:12:42,572 --> 00:12:45,353
I mean, please.
And thank you.

120
00:12:46,376 --> 00:12:48,575
- I'll be in my office
- Okay.

121
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,894
Later, baby.

122
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,454
Now when you have a moment,

123
00:12:52,654 --> 00:12:55,476
we should discuss how you'd
like to run the household.

124
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,343
Run the household?

125
00:12:58,619 --> 00:13:00,051
The dinner menus,

126
00:13:00,252 --> 00:13:02,695
the wine list,
the flowers...

127
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:06,113
...and what changes you'd like
made to the decor?

128
00:13:07,922 --> 00:13:10,885
I know it's a
lot to take in.

129
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:13,738
- Mrs. Grey, there is no rush.
- Can't you just call me Anna?

130
00:13:13,854 --> 00:13:17,372
Well, Mr. Gray likes to
be called Mr. Grey.

131
00:13:17,627 --> 00:13:19,597
So, that would be a little odd.

132
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,119
Okay.

133
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:22,927
Now what would
you like for tonight?

134
00:13:23,195 --> 00:13:24,196
I have beef...

135
00:13:24,397 --> 00:13:26,212
Actually I was kind of
thinking that maybe I

136
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,913
could just cook dinner
for Christian tonight.

137
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:30,643
Mrs. Grey.

138
00:13:30,864 --> 00:13:32,347
I'm so sorry. You prob...

139
00:13:32,547 --> 00:13:34,506
I don't wanna
mess up your plans.

140
00:13:34,729 --> 00:13:38,189
Mrs. Gray,
this is your home.

141
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:39,806
This is your kitchen.

142
00:13:40,007 --> 00:13:42,165
You don't need to ask permission.

143
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:44,146
Now, why don't I show
you what's in the freeze

144
00:13:44,347 --> 00:13:45,647
and you can take it from there.

145
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,026
Perfect.

146
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:52,444
Perfect timing.

147
00:13:54,536 --> 00:13:57,082
- Where's Gail?
- I gave her a night off.

148
00:13:57,224 --> 00:13:58,225
Sit.

149
00:14:02,256 --> 00:14:05,631
Medium-Rare.
Just how sir likes it.

150
00:14:06,343 --> 00:14:07,701
I can get used to this.

151
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,590
Well, we 're kind of married,
so you might have to.

152
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,440
I meant you, in my kitchen.

153
00:14:15,718 --> 00:14:18,560
You mean, barefoot and pregnant?

154
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,792
- That was a joke.
- Yeah.

155
00:14:24,971 --> 00:14:27,235
I'm assuming it wasn't the

156
00:14:27,436 --> 00:14:30,080
barefoot part that made you
nearly choke on your food.

157
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,660
You do wanna have
kids some day, right?

158
00:14:36,265 --> 00:14:38,395
Someday, sure.

159
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:43,337
You don't really sound sure.

160
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,342
You know what I'm sure about?

161
00:14:46,491 --> 00:14:49,016
- That's great stake.
- Christian.

162
00:14:54,165 --> 00:14:57,390
- Do you not wanna have kids?
- Of course.

163
00:14:58,099 --> 00:15:01,360
One day, just,
not now.

164
00:15:01,463 --> 00:15:03,326
I'm not ready to share you

165
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,857
with anyone.

166
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:17,917
- Mrs. Grey.
- Thank you.

167
00:15:43,921 --> 00:15:46,812
Anna, nice of you to join us.

168
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:50,775
Hi Liz, am I in the right office?

169
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:51,881
We had a makeover,

170
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:54,876
Mr Roach wanted to welcome
the new fiction editor.

171
00:15:54,966 --> 00:15:58,060
- Who's the new fiction editor?
- You are.

172
00:15:58,346 --> 00:16:01,407
You got a promotion.

173
00:16:01,442 --> 00:16:05,254
- I got a promotion?
- And you were not even here.

174
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:10,006
- Anna!
- Hi, Hannah.

175
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:12,730
- Hi.
- Welcome back.

176
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:14,881
- How do you like your new desk?
- Amazing.

177
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:16,667
I'm gonna let your get settled in.

178
00:16:16,703 --> 00:16:19,200
And Anna, good luck.
Not that you need it.

179
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:24,876
So... Who is that beautiful man?

180
00:16:25,115 --> 00:16:27,668
Oh, that's Sawyer.
My personal security.

181
00:16:29,118 --> 00:16:32,018
I know... It's very very fancy.

182
00:16:32,244 --> 00:16:36,497
- Can we find a spot for him?
- I might have an opening.

183
00:16:36,874 --> 00:16:40,370
Hannah?
Down girl.

184
00:16:40,406 --> 00:16:42,473
Everything is in
relativelythe same spot.

185
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:44,711
Oh, and I asked IT
to change your email.

186
00:16:45,494 --> 00:16:48,837
Because they still have you as
Anna Steele instead of Anna Grey.

187
00:16:51,292 --> 00:16:54,495
Oh, um... Let's just leave it for a while.

188
00:16:54,696 --> 00:16:56,771
Done. And Boyce Fox is in town.

189
00:16:58,526 --> 00:17:01,883
Awesome, thank you,
thanks Hannah.

190
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:22,978
This is amazing. Anna, I
can't thank you enough.

191
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:25,420
Well, you did the work.

192
00:17:25,673 --> 00:17:27,913
Now, when am I gonna see
pages for book too?

193
00:17:28,204 --> 00:17:32,448
Already? Well, I have
written 3 chapters so far.

194
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:36,650
Christian, Boyce.
This is my husband, Christian Gray.

195
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,534
- Christian, this is Boyce Fox
- Pleasure to meet you.

196
00:17:39,715 --> 00:17:41,729
Absolutely. Do you mind?

197
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,310
I need a word with Mrs Steele here.

198
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:45,981
No. Actually no,
we are not finished.

199
00:17:47,143 --> 00:17:49,228
You know, I'm just gonna grab a coffee.

200
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:50,605
It's nice to meet you.

201
00:17:55,615 --> 00:17:58,656
- Good looking guy.
- Seriously, Christian?

202
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:01,554
You evading my authors now?

203
00:18:03,787 --> 00:18:07,082
I tried emailing you, it bounced.

204
00:18:07,288 --> 00:18:09,962
There is no Anastasia Grey at SIP.

205
00:18:11,354 --> 00:18:15,175
I know, Anna Steele is
the name I use at work.

206
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:17,682
And I know you're gonna
say I don't need to work.

207
00:18:17,717 --> 00:18:22,060
But I can's stay home and do
lunches and choose wall paper.

208
00:18:22,062 --> 00:18:23,500
I'll loose my mind.

209
00:18:23,714 --> 00:18:26,581
I work because I love my job.

210
00:18:26,826 --> 00:18:30,377
Understood, but you can't
love it as Anna Grey?

211
00:18:30,661 --> 00:18:33,431
I need to have my
own identity here.

212
00:18:33,724 --> 00:18:36,648
People already think I got to
where I am because of you.

213
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:37,869
But you didn't.

214
00:18:37,969 --> 00:18:40,570
You got this through
hard work and talent.

215
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:43,942
Why does it matter
what you call yourself?

216
00:18:44,143 --> 00:18:45,588
Who gives a shit
what people think?

217
00:18:45,623 --> 00:18:47,233
Apparently you do.

218
00:18:48,315 --> 00:18:51,123
Would you change your name for me?

219
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:54,629
Yes, if it meant that much to you.

220
00:18:55,857 --> 00:18:59,278
Okay, I'll think about it.

221
00:18:59,534 --> 00:19:02,119
- You will?
- Yeah.

222
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,290
That's how this works.
Remember?

223
00:19:07,326 --> 00:19:11,145
Talk, listen,
work stuff out.

224
00:19:11,804 --> 00:19:15,146
Now, get lost.
I gotta find my author.

225
00:19:15,181 --> 00:19:17,279
And you need to shave.

226
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,269
I'll pick you up at five.

227
00:19:24,224 --> 00:19:26,227
I might not be done by then.

228
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:30,711
My boss's boss's boss is
kind of a pain in the ass.

229
00:19:34,978 --> 00:19:35,996
Boyce.

230
00:19:47,756 --> 00:19:50,901
Sawyer comes right with Taylor.
You're coming with me.

231
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:58,517
- Can I drive?
- This? I do not think so.

232
00:19:58,552 --> 00:19:59,589
- Let me drive it.
- No.

233
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:00,878
- Let me drive it.
- No.

234
00:20:52,171 --> 00:20:54,706
I feel like I have been here before.

235
00:20:54,907 --> 00:20:55,964
You saw it.

236
00:20:55,999 --> 00:20:58,929
When we were sailing on the south.

237
00:20:59,432 --> 00:21:02,337
- It's beautiful.
- I bought it.

238
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,917
For us, there is a home.

239
00:21:07,926 --> 00:21:09,533
I should have asked you first.

240
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,588
If you don't like it
we can always.

241
00:21:14,878 --> 00:21:17,120
- I love it
- You do?

242
00:21:22,441 --> 00:21:24,190
Oh, my God!

243
00:21:27,274 --> 00:21:29,439
- Christian
- Hi.

244
00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:32,404
- Anastasia.
- Hi.

245
00:21:32,605 --> 00:21:34,594
This is Jaya Matteo, the architect.

246
00:21:34,954 --> 00:21:38,827
- She is a friend of Elliott.
- This location is perfect.

247
00:21:39,114 --> 00:21:41,674
I'm gonna build you
a fabulous house.

248
00:21:42,189 --> 00:21:45,183
- I'd like to show Anna inside.
- Of course.

249
00:21:45,476 --> 00:21:48,671
That JQ profile on you.

250
00:21:49,168 --> 00:21:52,738
- I love what you're doing in Africa.
- Oh, thank you.

251
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:54,832
Now,

252
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,354
let me show you
what I have in mind.

253
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:03,607
A state of the art, self
sufficient, smart house.

254
00:22:03,642 --> 00:22:06,221
Marine steel self cleaning glass.

255
00:22:06,257 --> 00:22:09,755
A guest wing with an entertaining
area to the west.

256
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:15,462
And this, infinity pool, will
really make that beautiful sound.

257
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:20,886
Um... You wanna tear the
whole house down?

258
00:22:20,921 --> 00:22:23,745
Don't you?
It's so dated.

259
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,912
I like it.
I think it has character.

260
00:22:29,305 --> 00:22:33,376
Well, a new house
would be a statement

261
00:22:33,411 --> 00:22:37,800
and Ecologically efficient. I mean
this older places are so impractical.

262
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,331
- But it's up to you.
- Actually it's up to my wife.

263
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:45,085
What she says goes.

264
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,359
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

265
00:22:48,427 --> 00:22:49,462
Hey, Ross.
Yeah.

266
00:22:50,852 --> 00:22:54,961
Huh, I suppose we could reuse
some of the existing stone.

267
00:22:56,429 --> 00:22:58,534
It is Jaya, right?

268
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,820
I'm sure you are very
good at what you do.

269
00:23:02,922 --> 00:23:05,159
Otherwise, Christian wouldn't
have asked for your input.

270
00:23:07,335 --> 00:23:10,446
But please stop speaking of
my husband as if I weren't here.

271
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:11,680
Anna.

272
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,977
I have designed many
prestige projects.

273
00:23:16,012 --> 00:23:17,899
You may call me Mrs. Grey.

274
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:21,941
And this is not a Prestige project,
this is gonna be our home.

275
00:23:22,232 --> 00:23:25,821
So, if you want this job,

276
00:23:25,857 --> 00:23:28,034
I suggest you stop making
eyes off my husband

277
00:23:28,234 --> 00:23:29,866
and keep your hands to yourself.

278
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,542
Or you can go and
climb back into your

279
00:23:33,742 --> 00:23:36,087
shit color car and
drive back to Seattle.

280
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,935
It's up to you.

281
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:44,199
Look, I'm sorry Mrs. Grey
but I would never...

282
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,527
It won't happen again.

283
00:23:50,312 --> 00:23:52,809
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

284
00:23:52,845 --> 00:23:55,357
We were just discussing
an alternative approach.

285
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:59,199
Something less in your face,

286
00:23:59,712 --> 00:24:02,108
more respectful.

287
00:24:04,082 --> 00:24:07,810
Sure, only start over.

288
00:24:10,972 --> 00:24:12,536
I'll draw up new plans

289
00:24:12,737 --> 00:24:15,795
and you'll have them in
the next few weeks.

290
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,647
Great, we look forward to it.

291
00:24:17,683 --> 00:24:20,232
- Mr Grey.
- Thanks, Jaya.

292
00:24:20,714 --> 00:24:22,692
Mrs. Grey.

293
00:24:27,395 --> 00:24:29,583
This is gonna be fun.

294
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:34,364
I am paying for extra security and
you are scarier than any of them.

295
00:24:34,565 --> 00:24:36,043
Here.

296
00:24:36,488 --> 00:24:39,370
You can handle her,
you can handle this.

297
00:24:55,636 --> 00:24:57,652
Wow, Anna.
Easy, Anna.

298
00:25:12,348 --> 00:25:15,261
We've lost Taylor and Sawyer.

299
00:25:15,296 --> 00:25:18,986
Slackers.
I am a race car driver.

300
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:23,706
Hey, Taylor.
The SUV.

301
00:25:24,466 --> 00:25:25,817
I see it.

302
00:25:28,592 --> 00:25:30,269
We are being followed.

303
00:25:30,305 --> 00:25:33,113
- That's Dodge?
- Sawyer ran the plates, it's fake.

304
00:25:33,148 --> 00:25:34,932
- Loose them.
- Seriously?

305
00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:36,770
Seriously.

306
00:25:37,139 --> 00:25:38,422
Loose them.

307
00:25:56,115 --> 00:25:59,263
You can make it, don't slow down.
Heads up and get us home.

308
00:26:07,848 --> 00:26:09,670
Good work.

309
00:26:28,334 --> 00:26:29,717
Taylor, I've got you on speaker.

310
00:26:29,918 --> 00:26:31,567
<i>We are right behind the Dodge.
Mr. Grey,</i>

311
00:26:31,768 --> 00:26:33,376
<i>he's still trying to
catch up with you.</i>

312
00:26:33,411 --> 00:26:34,810
Can you make out the driver?

313
00:26:34,846 --> 00:26:36,616
<i>No, not yet.</i>

314
00:26:38,837 --> 00:26:40,487
Go.

315
00:26:46,947 --> 00:26:48,670
Come on, dude.

316
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,360
- Flash rear lights.
- That's a dick move.

317
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:05,818
Get out here.

318
00:27:19,062 --> 00:27:20,645
There, the parking lot.

319
00:27:28,103 --> 00:27:29,123
- Taylor?
- Yes sir.

320
00:27:29,324 --> 00:27:31,761
- Have we lost him?
- We're still in pursuit.

321
00:27:32,464 --> 00:27:34,310
You okay?

322
00:27:41,714 --> 00:27:44,324
- We are in a parking lot.
- I know.

323
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:19,668
Sorry, Mr. Grey, we lost them.

324
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:21,379
That's gotta be Hyde.

325
00:28:21,648 --> 00:28:23,718
I got this from Highway Patrol.

326
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,197
That's not Hyde.
That looks like a woman.

327
00:28:28,517 --> 00:28:30,354
Where's Leyla Williams right now?

328
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,813
Still with the family in Connecticut.

329
00:28:31,837 --> 00:28:33,977
Whoever it is
she's gotta be working with Hyde.

330
00:28:34,206 --> 00:28:36,540
- What's the latest on him?
- He hasn't been seen for month.

331
00:28:36,564 --> 00:28:38,762
No purchases,
no ATM transactions.

332
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:40,543
What about friends, family?

333
00:28:40,579 --> 00:28:41,863
Yeah, not much of either.

334
00:28:41,898 --> 00:28:44,744
OK. I want everything there
is to know about Hyde.

335
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:47,686
Where he comes from,
his shoe size. All of it.

336
00:28:47,721 --> 00:28:49,812
And I want the three of
you with us in New York.

337
00:28:49,848 --> 00:28:50,904
What?

338
00:28:51,004 --> 00:28:52,837
I have to go there for a meeting
this week. You're coming with me.

339
00:28:56,645 --> 00:28:58,907
Can you guys give us a second?

340
00:29:01,398 --> 00:29:04,392
You know I can't go to New York,
I have to work.

341
00:29:04,427 --> 00:29:06,985
- Take it with you
- I have meetings.

342
00:29:07,021 --> 00:29:08,786
- Reschedule.
- I have to show up.

343
00:29:08,822 --> 00:29:11,942
I have responsibilities, you
can't keep me in a cage.

344
00:29:11,978 --> 00:29:13,839
- I just want you to be safe.
- I will be safe.

345
00:29:13,874 --> 00:29:15,658
I have Sawyer and Prescott.

346
00:29:17,101 --> 00:29:18,798
I'll be fine.

347
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,479
You need a haircut.

348
00:29:22,355 --> 00:29:23,584
Not the priority

349
00:29:23,784 --> 00:29:25,862
- I can do it.
- No.

350
00:29:26,063 --> 00:29:28,547
Yeah, I used to cut my
dad's hair all the time.

351
00:29:28,582 --> 00:29:30,325
I don't want to
look like your father.

352
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,228
Okay.

353
00:30:09,268 --> 00:30:11,256
- Christian.
- What?

354
00:30:11,258 --> 00:30:13,493
- You're distracting me.
- Okay.

355
00:30:13,668 --> 00:30:15,724
You 're done?

356
00:30:28,054 --> 00:30:30,961
Okay, enough.
Enough!

357
00:30:31,744 --> 00:30:35,602
- Where are the scissors?
- On my desk.

358
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,230
Wait here.
Don't move.

359
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,383
I am not going anywhere

360
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,215
Why is there a
gun in your desk?

361
00:31:26,501 --> 00:31:27,534
It's Leila's.

362
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:31,084
Why didn't you give it to the cops?

363
00:31:32,896 --> 00:31:35,484
She's in enough trouble.

364
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,578
Here.

365
00:31:46,662 --> 00:31:48,923
Like a river.

366
00:31:49,624 --> 00:31:50,689
Okay.

367
00:32:14,834 --> 00:32:18,970
- Good morning, wife
- Good morning, husband.

368
00:32:20,762 --> 00:32:21,763
I am off.

369
00:32:24,886 --> 00:32:28,314
Fly safe.
Text me when you land.

370
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,519
Stay close to
Sawyer and Prescott

371
00:32:30,887 --> 00:32:33,401
Come straight home after work.

372
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:35,980
I really promise.

373
00:32:36,306 --> 00:32:37,915
I love you.

374
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,214
Hi, Mr. Roach.

375
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:06,616
Jerry, come on,
Jesus it's Jerry, OK?

376
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,961
Pre-orders for Boyce Fox,
check that out. Check it out.

377
00:33:13,806 --> 00:33:15,470
Two hundred thousand?

378
00:33:15,548 --> 00:33:17,090
That includes the
books and the marketing

379
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:18,682
hasn't yet gotten
off the blocks yet.

380
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:19,889
Oh, my God.

381
00:33:20,089 --> 00:33:22,359
You were right
about his readerships.

382
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,684
That's really just.

383
00:33:24,946 --> 00:33:27,466
That's good work, really
good work Anna.

384
00:33:28,562 --> 00:33:29,812
Keep it coming.

385
00:33:36,387 --> 00:33:38,878
<i>Kate- Hey stranger! Drinks tonight?
I got us a table at the Bunker club!</i>

386
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:07,621
Sawyer, can we go to the
bunker club please?

387
00:34:07,657 --> 00:34:09,453
Mr. Gray said to take
you straight home.

388
00:34:09,621 --> 00:34:12,932
Oh! Mr. Grey is not here, I am.

389
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,916
So... Bunker club please.

390
00:34:15,461 --> 00:34:17,533
Yes Ma'am.

391
00:34:19,685 --> 00:34:21,623
So really? A personal bodyguard?

392
00:34:21,823 --> 00:34:24,002
Because Elliott wasn't exaggerating.

393
00:34:24,299 --> 00:34:25,096
What do you mean?

394
00:34:25,132 --> 00:34:26,700
He said that Christian
ran security for the

395
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,469
whole family after what
happened with Hyde.

396
00:34:28,494 --> 00:34:30,190
Apparently it's driving
them nuts and

397
00:34:30,391 --> 00:34:32,042
Mia keeps giving
hard time to sleep.

398
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,716
Why do you look me like

399
00:34:34,016 --> 00:34:35,222
you don't know what
I am talking about?

400
00:34:35,672 --> 00:34:38,262
I don't know what
you're talking about.

401
00:34:38,298 --> 00:34:40,468
After they found all those
files on Hyde's computer,

402
00:34:40,782 --> 00:34:44,469
stuff about Christian, the Greys
he didn't tell you any of that?

403
00:34:44,795 --> 00:34:49,501
No, no, he didn't. But I'm
sure, he had his reasons.

404
00:34:51,058 --> 00:34:54,717
Hey, hi, excuse me, can we get
two more Martinis, please?

405
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:56,021
<i>Of course, right away.</i>

406
00:34:56,707 --> 00:35:00,149
I can't really. I promised
Christian, I would go home.

407
00:35:00,184 --> 00:35:03,792
Oh come on, you're afraid that your
hot bodyguard's gonna knock on you.

408
00:35:04,034 --> 00:35:07,620
Yeah, probably.

409
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:11,950
- How is Elliott? What's going on?
- He is busy.

410
00:35:12,302 --> 00:35:16,280
He is working on this Eco project
with that architect Jaya Matteo.

411
00:35:16,564 --> 00:35:19,947
- One with the the really big...
- Plans.

412
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:23,754
Yeah, Hugh plans, and boy, does
Elliott like to look at those plans.

413
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:27,727
- No, he adores you Kate.
- I don't know, I just...

414
00:35:27,762 --> 00:35:29,705
I have this feeling.

415
00:35:30,029 --> 00:35:31,903
Why don't you just
ask him straight out?

416
00:35:31,938 --> 00:35:34,238
Honestly I don't know
if I know the answer.

417
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,606
What ever. I hate that
I even care this much.

418
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,993
- No, no!
- There you go.

419
00:35:41,194 --> 00:35:43,367
Thank you, just keep
'em coming. Will you?

420
00:35:43,567 --> 00:35:45,217
- And don't ever stop. Thank you.
- Of course.

421
00:35:45,516 --> 00:35:48,917
No, I really can't, I am gonna
get in so much trouble.

422
00:35:48,968 --> 00:35:51,875
Look at you,
you're so...

423
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,718
- What?
- Married.

424
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,197
I know.

425
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:58,981
Honestly, it happened so fast.

426
00:36:00,142 --> 00:36:01,984
Make my head spin.

427
00:36:02,984 --> 00:36:06,437
- It suits you.
- Yeah, I think it does.

428
00:36:06,538 --> 00:36:09,227
Yeah, except you don't
see enough your friends.

429
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:12,758
- I know, I know, I'm sorry.
- I missed your face. Cheers.

430
00:36:12,794 --> 00:36:14,583
Cheers.

431
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:16,602
- To your face.
- To my plans.

432
00:36:18,013 --> 00:36:20,972
Oh, my God, what is that?

433
00:36:21,008 --> 00:36:25,087
You know me,
I hate jelly fish.

434
00:36:25,122 --> 00:36:28,039
And I'm like halfway out of the
water and halfway off the terrain.

435
00:36:28,734 --> 00:36:30,891
Oh, my God.
You are so cute.

436
00:36:31,176 --> 00:36:33,070
- I missed you.
- I missed you.

437
00:36:33,367 --> 00:36:35,535
I'm gonna stalk you until
you make another date OK?

438
00:36:37,098 --> 00:36:38,698
Oh sorry, my phone.
It's just crazy.

439
00:36:38,734 --> 00:36:40,213
- It's OK
- Oh Jesus.

440
00:36:41,394 --> 00:36:44,558
- Come on, we'll give you a ride.
- Okay.

441
00:36:45,146 --> 00:36:48,228
<i>This is Christian Gray.
Leave a message.</i>

442
00:36:51,947 --> 00:36:52,978
Sawyer,

443
00:36:53,013 --> 00:36:57,496
if you speak to my
husband tonight,

444
00:36:57,532 --> 00:37:01,295
just don't say anything.
Let me tell him

445
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,218
that I was out with Kate. OK?

446
00:37:03,942 --> 00:37:05,487
Mr. Gray already knows.

447
00:37:05,688 --> 00:37:08,308
I spoke with him
when you got off work.

448
00:37:11,904 --> 00:37:13,344
Shit.

449
00:37:42,782 --> 00:37:43,897
Mrs Gray?

450
00:37:45,611 --> 00:37:47,770
Anna, you are
gonna be a good girl.

451
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,963
And you will walk to the elevator

452
00:37:51,318 --> 00:37:54,743
nice and slow.

453
00:37:56,573 --> 00:37:58,614
Mrs. Gray!
Let her go.

454
00:38:02,258 --> 00:38:06,827
- Go ahead. Take the shot.
- Drop the knife.

455
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,416
Hands on your head.

456
00:38:13,571 --> 00:38:15,822
Hands on your head or I will fire.

457
00:38:16,976 --> 00:38:18,227
You okay, Mrs. Gray?

458
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:19,583
- Did he hurt you?
- No. I am fine.

459
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:22,722
- Better restrain him.
- I don't have anything.

460
00:38:22,757 --> 00:38:26,982
We do, I can find something.

461
00:38:29,151 --> 00:38:33,433
- So, Hyde's a former colleague of yours?
- Ah, yes. He was my boss.

462
00:38:33,651 --> 00:38:34,928
Until a few weeks ago but,

463
00:38:34,963 --> 00:38:37,722
they let him go.

464
00:38:37,758 --> 00:38:40,210
- Can I ask why?
- Because he attacked me.

465
00:38:40,246 --> 00:38:43,091
Sir, we recovered this from an elevator

466
00:38:43,291 --> 00:38:45,149
maintenance vehicle
parked in lower garage.

467
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:46,904
Stolen plates,

468
00:38:46,939 --> 00:38:48,964
must have been how the
suspect gained access.

469
00:38:50,819 --> 00:38:52,645
This mean anything
to you, Mrs. Gray?

470
00:38:57,076 --> 00:38:58,835
No, nothing.

471
00:38:59,076 --> 00:39:02,335
Mr. Grey is on his way home,
we will need to wrap this up.

472
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:05,675
We will finish this another time
Mrs. Gray. You rest.

473
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,531
And uh...

474
00:39:08,567 --> 00:39:10,607
Don't worry about Hyde, we've
got enough to hold him.

475
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:11,977
He won't be going heavy.

476
00:39:13,053 --> 00:39:14,584
Alright.

477
00:39:30,823 --> 00:39:32,024
Hi.

478
00:39:43,106 --> 00:39:44,649
Come to bed.

479
00:39:56,844 --> 00:39:58,266
Maybe later.

480
00:40:47,681 --> 00:40:49,072
I can't.

481
00:41:03,441 --> 00:41:04,664
Anna, hey.

482
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:08,382
I just saw this.
Are you okay?

483
00:41:12,614 --> 00:41:15,363
Must have been terrifying.
Are you sure you should be in work?

484
00:41:15,399 --> 00:41:17,264
Yes, it was but I'm, I'm...

485
00:41:17,421 --> 00:41:18,670
I'm fine.

486
00:41:19,523 --> 00:41:20,844
I'm fine.

487
00:41:28,174 --> 00:41:30,884
One of the reports said
that it was Jack Hyde.

488
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,960
It was.

489
00:41:34,975 --> 00:41:36,343
What did he want?

490
00:41:36,568 --> 00:41:40,496
Liz, I appreciate your concern
but I don't wanna talk about it.

491
00:41:42,786 --> 00:41:44,168
Okay.

492
00:41:44,395 --> 00:41:46,760
I don't know what
I'm gonna tell Mr. Roach.

493
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,065
I will talk to Jerry.

494
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:55,152
Whatever you say,
Mrs. Gray.

495
00:42:05,216 --> 00:42:07,087
Hello?

496
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:15,943
Welcome home Anastasia.

497
00:42:17,811 --> 00:42:18,949
Christian?

498
00:42:19,752 --> 00:42:21,066
Where's everybody?

499
00:42:21,263 --> 00:42:22,432
Elsewhere.

500
00:42:28,794 --> 00:42:30,730
I thought you were mad at me.

501
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:33,043
Turn around.

502
00:42:52,786 --> 00:42:54,824
We're going to the playroom.

503
00:43:42,544 --> 00:43:44,689
I'm gonna drive you wild.

504
00:44:18,957 --> 00:44:21,208
That's how you make me feel.

505
00:44:22,912 --> 00:44:24,336
Christian.

506
00:44:25,491 --> 00:44:27,347
You promise one thing

507
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,903
then do the opposite.

508
00:44:34,634 --> 00:44:36,518
Now you know how that feels.

509
00:44:37,193 --> 00:44:39,474
Christian... What are you doing?

510
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,938
- Don't stop.
- Frustrating, right?

511
00:44:41,973 --> 00:44:43,278
Why are you stopping?

512
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:45,407
Frustrating like you.

513
00:44:45,442 --> 00:44:47,129
Red, red.

514
00:44:47,165 --> 00:44:49,966
Red, red, red, red!

515
00:45:12,064 --> 00:45:15,355
That was not love.
Christian, that was revenge.

516
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:17,008
You told me you were coming
straight home

517
00:45:17,044 --> 00:45:19,148
Don't use the red room
to even the score.

518
00:45:19,184 --> 00:45:20,199
I was scared for you.

519
00:45:20,399 --> 00:45:22,855
I was safer in that bar
with Kate than I was here.

520
00:45:23,745 --> 00:45:25,509
I denied you,

521
00:45:25,544 --> 00:45:27,215
so you would understand
what it feels like

522
00:45:27,316 --> 00:45:29,617
for me when you
break your promises.

523
00:45:29,653 --> 00:45:30,991
You denied me to punish me.

524
00:45:31,026 --> 00:45:33,601
I felt powerless knowing
that Hyde was out there.

525
00:45:33,637 --> 00:45:35,690
I was angry,
I was away from home.

526
00:45:38,468 --> 00:45:41,262
I just wanted to see my friends.

527
00:45:41,297 --> 00:45:43,213
But Christian, why didn't
you tell me that

528
00:45:43,414 --> 00:45:45,421
he was keeping files
on you and your family?

529
00:45:45,807 --> 00:45:47,909
What is that about?

530
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:49,367
Anna, please.

531
00:45:55,889 --> 00:45:58,451
The truth is I have no idea.

532
00:45:58,487 --> 00:46:01,095
Why is he going to these
links to get to us?

533
00:46:01,183 --> 00:46:02,955
There has to be a reason.

534
00:46:03,871 --> 00:46:05,426
There is gotta be some connection.

535
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:06,679
I know.

536
00:46:15,214 --> 00:46:17,529
You know, I had a dream last night.

537
00:46:18,751 --> 00:46:21,698
That you are dead.

538
00:46:21,733 --> 00:46:23,963
And you are lying on the concrete.

539
00:46:25,029 --> 00:46:28,731
And you were cold and
I couldn't wake you.

540
00:46:31,389 --> 00:46:32,574
I'm fine.

541
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:36,065
I'm right here, I'm fine.

542
00:46:39,256 --> 00:46:41,388
Hyde is locked up now.

543
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,907
And I'm right here with you.

544
00:46:47,866 --> 00:46:49,285
I'm sorry.

545
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,275
- Sawyer.
- Hanna.

546
00:47:03,194 --> 00:47:05,328
Anna Stee... Gray.

547
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:09,954
Mrs. Gray, it's your boss's boss's boss.
Look out your window.

548
00:47:10,414 --> 00:47:13,559
I think you deserved
a break from all this.

549
00:47:13,594 --> 00:47:15,755
I'm taking you away for the weekend.

550
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:19,195
Mrs. Jones has packed your bags.
It's in the trunk.

551
00:47:19,231 --> 00:47:23,305
Did she know? Do I get to know
where we are going this time?

552
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:24,342
Yes babe.

553
00:47:24,529 --> 00:47:26,728
You won that auction.
Right as where gets

554
00:47:26,828 --> 00:47:29,234
- your money's worth.
- Okay I'm coming.

555
00:47:33,287 --> 00:47:36,243
- Nice to see you again, Statham.
- Mrs. Grey, Mr. Grey.

556
00:47:43,438 --> 00:47:44,820
- Surprise!
- Oh my God!

557
00:47:46,529 --> 00:47:48,931
You don't wanted to see
more of your friends?

558
00:48:17,965 --> 00:48:20,100
That's beautiful.

559
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:24,757
You think this is nice?
You should see it in the snow.

560
00:48:24,793 --> 00:48:26,764
You should totally hit
the sauna together.

561
00:48:26,774 --> 00:48:28,021
Totally.

562
00:48:32,266 --> 00:48:35,645
Okay, this one's yours,
I am at the other end of the house.

563
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:38,190
And you two can make
as much noise as you can.

564
00:48:41,112 --> 00:48:43,572
And there's a piano.

565
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:00,668
No way.

566
00:49:02,467 --> 00:49:04,752
You guys must have
heard him play before.

567
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:08,298
- We have never heard him sing
- Ever.

568
00:49:11,569 --> 00:49:14,310
Maybe I've heard enough.

569
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:39,437
Do you think Elliott would
ever cheat on Kate?

570
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:45,442
She thinks he is sleeping
with Jaya Matteo.

571
00:49:45,677 --> 00:49:48,508
I'm sure he has but
that doesn't mean he has now.

572
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,819
Really? He has?

573
00:49:49,855 --> 00:49:53,326
Probably, Elliott's slept
with half of Seattle.

574
00:49:56,384 --> 00:50:01,165
I didn't know he was so...
Promiscuous.

575
00:50:01,675 --> 00:50:04,565
- Anna, that's none of our business
- I know.

576
00:50:05,382 --> 00:50:10,136
Well, it will be our business when I
murder him for breaking Kate's heart.

577
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,803
Mia said you hardly ever come here.

578
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:21,074
There's never been someone
I wanted to bring up here.

579
00:50:21,415 --> 00:50:23,525
I was waiting for you.

580
00:50:55,663 --> 00:50:56,892
<i>Anna.</i>

581
00:51:30,411 --> 00:51:31,994
Nice one.

582
00:51:33,844 --> 00:51:35,347
There you are.

583
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:36,844
I was looking for you.

584
00:51:38,789 --> 00:51:39,790
You alright?

585
00:51:40,441 --> 00:51:41,756
I couldn't sleep.

586
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,822
You wanna talk about it?

587
00:51:43,858 --> 00:51:47,164
I've always talked this
pint of icecream about it.

588
00:51:50,334 --> 00:51:52,237
I'll make you some tea.

589
00:52:05,751 --> 00:52:07,323
I'm so sorry.

590
00:52:07,729 --> 00:52:09,148
Not funny.

591
00:52:10,074 --> 00:52:11,874
Oh God, it's dripping,
I'll get it.

592
00:52:20,261 --> 00:52:21,360
Okay.

593
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:24,306
This is mine.

594
00:52:29,451 --> 00:52:30,538
Okay.

595
00:53:55,677 --> 00:53:58,778
- What?
- It's my turn.

596
00:54:27,668 --> 00:54:28,825
- Anna
- What?

597
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:31,132
Keep it down, no need to
wake up the whole house.

598
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,864
I really don't care
about the whole house.

599
00:55:00,374 --> 00:55:02,908
Christian, Elliott is taking
us hiking, you coming?

600
00:55:03,067 --> 00:55:04,492
No, I have work to do.

601
00:55:05,038 --> 00:55:07,763
Come on, it's just
stroll in the hills.

602
00:55:08,018 --> 00:55:09,401
When Elliott says stroll he means

603
00:55:09,584 --> 00:55:12,421
twenty miles straight
uphill with but tree bark.

604
00:55:12,878 --> 00:55:14,822
What if I run into a bear?

605
00:55:15,027 --> 00:55:16,965
Good luck to the bear.

606
00:55:19,558 --> 00:55:21,490
How was Christian
like when he was little?

607
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:23,314
He hasn't ever really talk about it.

608
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:25,054
That's a miracle he talks at all,

609
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:26,960
when Mom and Dad
first brought him home,

610
00:55:27,251 --> 00:55:28,499
he never spoke.

611
00:55:28,726 --> 00:55:30,995
He didn't cry, I mean
he's never cried.

612
00:55:31,273 --> 00:55:32,783
He did kick the
crap out of me a few

613
00:55:32,984 --> 00:55:34,536
times when mom
wasn't looking though.

614
00:55:34,572 --> 00:55:35,587
Really?

615
00:55:35,818 --> 00:55:38,152
You guys seem like
you're pretty close now.

616
00:55:38,869 --> 00:55:40,962
Yes, we've grew up
a lot since then.

617
00:55:41,432 --> 00:55:42,862
Now I'm just in awe of him.

618
00:55:43,087 --> 00:55:44,991
He's the bravest guy I know.

619
00:55:45,484 --> 00:55:47,202
Nothing scares him

620
00:55:47,863 --> 00:55:50,195
You seem pretty fearless.

621
00:55:50,706 --> 00:55:52,940
Me? Nah.

622
00:55:54,004 --> 00:55:55,531
What are you so afraid of?

623
00:55:57,008 --> 00:55:59,944
Hey Elliott, when's this
forest march gonna end?

624
00:55:59,979 --> 00:56:02,030
I promised Anna
we would go shopping.

625
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,790
Well, guess we could go back through town.

626
00:56:04,991 --> 00:56:06,526
I got some errands to run to.

627
00:56:09,496 --> 00:56:12,306
Sir, this just came in.

628
00:56:12,348 --> 00:56:13,937
More background on Hyde

629
00:56:14,463 --> 00:56:18,391
Went to Princeton on scholarship,
graduated.

630
00:56:18,704 --> 00:56:19,953
Smart guy.

631
00:56:19,989 --> 00:56:23,405
Worked for publishers in
New York & Chicago before SIP.

632
00:56:24,136 --> 00:56:25,210
What else?

633
00:56:25,563 --> 00:56:28,905
We tracked down an exorcist
and since Hyde slept with her

634
00:56:28,941 --> 00:56:30,846
made a sex tape,
used it to blackmail her.

635
00:56:31,176 --> 00:56:32,514
Jesus.

636
00:56:32,549 --> 00:56:34,955
- Has she told the police?
- She would go on record.

637
00:56:35,206 --> 00:56:37,033
And another thing apparently Hyde was

638
00:56:37,234 --> 00:56:39,112
in and out of foster homes in Detroit.

639
00:56:39,391 --> 00:56:40,955
So was I.

640
00:56:42,005 --> 00:56:43,756
- Good work, keep digging.
- Sir.

641
00:56:44,014 --> 00:56:45,185
And Taylor...

642
00:56:45,434 --> 00:56:48,030
Anna is still shaking up.
Not a word about this for now.

643
00:56:48,126 --> 00:56:49,287
Yes sir.

644
00:56:55,164 --> 00:56:57,726
Oh, yes!

645
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:01,351
I don't know,
it's really low in the back.

646
00:57:01,387 --> 00:57:03,955
- It's hot
- Yeah, but...

647
00:57:04,298 --> 00:57:06,376
Christian is gonna
love this dress.

648
00:57:06,531 --> 00:57:08,355
Help, my zipper's stuck.

649
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:11,016
Oh, let me see.

650
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:35,289
- What do you think?
- Oh my God.

651
00:57:35,324 --> 00:57:38,442
Look at you,
you are like a valentine.

652
00:57:38,478 --> 00:57:39,810
Turn around.

653
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:43,459
- Elliot's gonna love it.
- He's gonna love it.

654
00:57:43,692 --> 00:57:45,245
Shoes.

655
00:57:45,281 --> 00:57:46,711
Let's have a drink.

656
00:57:47,215 --> 00:57:49,812
Oh, girl.
Look at you.

657
00:57:49,848 --> 00:57:51,612
I know
It's kind of like a napkin.

658
00:57:56,333 --> 00:57:59,313
Tell me you didn't
wear that to go hiking.

659
00:57:59,967 --> 00:58:01,287
Of course I did.

660
00:58:01,662 --> 00:58:03,094
I did.
It's um...

661
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:09,591
It's good for sweating and
has full range of motion.

662
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:11,770
Very short.

663
00:58:12,122 --> 00:58:13,336
I know.

664
00:58:14,606 --> 00:58:16,953
And it's not too far from here.

665
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:20,689
To here.

666
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,359
To there.

667
00:58:25,028 --> 00:58:26,199
To here.

668
00:58:26,886 --> 00:58:29,038
So just don't bend over,

669
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:30,440
we should be fine.

670
00:58:34,762 --> 00:58:36,397
Oops.

671
00:58:43,828 --> 00:58:47,249
Hey Elliott, did I see that
architecture up in town today?

672
00:58:47,526 --> 00:58:50,707
Jaya Matteo. Yeah.

673
00:58:50,974 --> 00:58:53,779
- She has a place here.
- OK.

674
00:58:54,275 --> 00:58:57,622
Are they real, like,
can they be real?

675
00:58:57,869 --> 00:58:59,272
I never asked.

676
00:58:59,308 --> 00:59:01,801
Two bottles of champagne
And six glasses, please.

677
00:59:03,472 --> 00:59:05,693
Are we celebrating something?

678
00:59:16,475 --> 00:59:19,526
At a certain point the idea,

679
00:59:19,985 --> 00:59:23,823
of spending the rest of my
life with one person seemed

680
00:59:24,176 --> 00:59:26,007
unimaginable.

681
00:59:27,413 --> 00:59:30,304
And then I met Kate.

682
00:59:30,339 --> 00:59:33,054
And I fell head over hills in love.

683
00:59:37,531 --> 00:59:40,117
I fell in love with your beauty.

684
00:59:40,362 --> 00:59:42,498
Your grace, your wisdom.

685
00:59:42,683 --> 00:59:44,377
For everything that you are.

686
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:49,906
Now the only thing I can't
imagine is being without you.

687
00:59:50,357 --> 00:59:53,891
Ever, so...

688
00:59:54,176 --> 00:59:55,685
marry me?

689
00:59:57,165 --> 00:59:58,750
Please?

690
00:59:58,786 --> 01:00:01,964
- Yes, yes, yes, yes!
- God.

691
01:00:09,457 --> 01:00:10,526
Congrats dude!

692
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:32,256
Now I know why you're acting so weird.

693
01:00:32,786 --> 01:00:36,480
- Did you pick it out yourself?
- A little help from an old friend.

694
01:00:37,057 --> 01:00:38,502
And old girlfriend?

695
01:00:40,182 --> 01:00:43,666
Hey, not everyone marries the
first girl they ever dated.

696
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:48,393
Some of us like to get a
ride the first time, bro.

697
01:00:51,559 --> 01:00:53,500
Just roll your eyes in me.

698
01:00:56,476 --> 01:00:57,641
Maybe.

699
01:00:58,046 --> 01:01:00,089
What are you gonna do about it?

700
01:01:13,277 --> 01:01:15,084
Top drawer on your right.

701
01:01:16,069 --> 01:01:18,115
Top drawer on the right. Go.

702
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:28,142
- No way.
- Anna.

703
01:01:28,501 --> 01:01:29,872
Do as you are told.

704
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:40,429
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

705
01:01:46,371 --> 01:01:47,464
You alright?

706
01:02:20,461 --> 01:02:23,280
Hey, Dr Green called in,

707
01:02:23,315 --> 01:02:26,074
and there is a Detective
Clark here to see you.

708
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:28,490
I'm sorry, Mrs. Gray,

709
01:02:28,691 --> 01:02:31,333
but my lieutenant asked me
to check something out.

710
01:02:33,098 --> 01:02:35,591
Jack Hyde claims you and
him were sleeping together

711
01:02:35,691 --> 01:02:36,987
when you worked at SIP.

712
01:02:37,216 --> 01:02:38,180
What?

713
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:40,281
He tried to break it off,
you got upset.

714
01:02:40,316 --> 01:02:43,130
And you made up this whole sexual
assault story to get him fired.

715
01:02:43,165 --> 01:02:44,159
What?

716
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,365
Says he came to you apartment to

717
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:46,587
try and straighten things out,

718
01:02:46,787 --> 01:02:49,161
but your security people got
involved and it all went south.

719
01:02:49,197 --> 01:02:51,111
No, that is complete bullshit.

720
01:02:51,146 --> 01:02:54,443
- I'll put that down as a denial.
- Jack attacked me.

721
01:02:54,485 --> 01:02:55,989
Right.

722
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:57,936
He attacked me and then
he He tried to kidnap me.

723
01:02:58,137 --> 01:02:59,193
Do you believe what he's saying?

724
01:02:59,453 --> 01:03:02,642
Officially, Mrs. Gray, it doesn't
matter what I believe.

725
01:03:03,545 --> 01:03:06,680
Unofficially,
I believe Hyde is a lying piece of shit

726
01:03:06,881 --> 01:03:08,811
who say anything to get bail.

727
01:03:09,091 --> 01:03:11,385
You need to be ready for that.

728
01:03:11,818 --> 01:03:14,803
- Thank you for your time
- Wait, Jack is applying for bail?

729
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:17,821
New wing today,
municipal courthouse.

730
01:03:21,554 --> 01:03:24,530
Does your client deny forcing
entry into this penthouse?

731
01:03:24,565 --> 01:03:26,366
He does not, Your Honor.
However...

732
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:29,673
My client has exhausted all
legitimate means of redress

733
01:03:29,709 --> 01:03:31,095
and merely wanted
to confront the party

734
01:03:31,295 --> 01:03:32,645
responsible for destroying his career.

735
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:35,280
I think he wanted to do more
than confront them, counselor.

736
01:03:35,735 --> 01:03:39,404
These are not the actions of an
innocent man seeking redress.

737
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:40,821
However,

738
01:03:41,013 --> 01:03:44,034
given his clean record, the
court will grant bail.

739
01:03:44,304 --> 01:03:46,666
- Set of five hundred thousand dollars.
- Your honor.

740
01:03:46,897 --> 01:03:48,238
Next case.

741
01:03:52,197 --> 01:03:53,406
Okay, let's go.

742
01:04:43,292 --> 01:04:45,369
I did leave a lot of messages.

743
01:04:45,697 --> 01:04:47,427
I know, I have been so busy,

744
01:04:47,628 --> 01:04:50,039
it just kind of slipped
though the cracks.

745
01:04:51,837 --> 01:04:53,277
Before we start...

746
01:05:04,672 --> 01:05:07,208
It seems you are pregnant, Mrs. Gray.

747
01:05:12,166 --> 01:05:14,384
Um...

748
01:05:14,623 --> 01:05:15,938
what?

749
01:05:16,139 --> 01:05:18,010
The shot is almost
a 100% effective.

750
01:05:18,274 --> 01:05:20,726
When administered regularly.

751
01:05:24,322 --> 01:05:27,345
There, it's heartbeat.

752
01:05:28,127 --> 01:05:29,643
Where?

753
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:32,513
Just there.

754
01:05:34,426 --> 01:05:36,213
A little blue.

755
01:05:36,365 --> 01:05:38,780
That's it, six seven weeks.

756
01:05:38,816 --> 01:05:40,334
Oh my God!

757
01:05:41,493 --> 01:05:43,096
How did it go today?

758
01:05:43,147 --> 01:05:46,998
Good, I got a visit
from detective Clark.

759
01:05:48,885 --> 01:05:52,202
Apparently Hyde is trying to
say that I came onto him.

760
01:05:52,633 --> 01:05:54,866
He expects people to believe that?

761
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:56,900
This is his word against mine.

762
01:06:01,961 --> 01:06:03,629
Is that what's bothering you?

763
01:06:04,573 --> 01:06:06,663
Anna, no one will believe him.

764
01:06:07,292 --> 01:06:09,538
And the other assistance,
they'll tell the detectives,

765
01:06:09,588 --> 01:06:10,932
I'm pregnant.

766
01:06:14,542 --> 01:06:16,399
Six or seven weeks.

767
01:06:21,241 --> 01:06:23,105
You forgot your shot.

768
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:26,814
Gosh.

769
01:06:27,326 --> 01:06:28,974
I'm sorry.

770
01:06:29,182 --> 01:06:32,417
- I know it's not good timing.
- I had plans for us.

771
01:06:32,865 --> 01:06:35,101
I wanted to give you the world.

772
01:06:38,162 --> 01:06:40,643
Do you really think that
I'm ready to be a father?

773
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:41,728
No.

774
01:06:42,463 --> 01:06:45,469
No, I don't,
and I'm not ready to be a mother either

775
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:47,436
but we'll just figure it out.

776
01:06:49,575 --> 01:06:52,659
I'm not ready to figure it out.

777
01:07:20,047 --> 01:07:21,788
He will come back.

778
01:07:45,296 --> 01:07:47,970
<i>Christian, it's me.
Where are you?</i>

779
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:51,216
<i>Please come home.</i>

780
01:08:15,813 --> 01:08:17,182
Hey!

781
01:08:17,627 --> 01:08:20,072
You look mighty fine, Mrs. Gray.

782
01:08:21,572 --> 01:08:25,746
Wow, you look mighty drunk.

783
01:08:25,956 --> 01:08:27,469
Where have you been?

784
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:33,099
Alright, let's go to bed.

785
01:08:33,405 --> 01:08:36,025
- Now you're talking
- OK, big guy.

786
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:37,830
Come on, lean on me.

787
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:42,227
You are so beautiful.

788
01:08:42,263 --> 01:08:45,218
Oh yeah, both of me?

789
01:08:46,726 --> 01:08:49,009
Okay, time for sleep.

790
01:08:49,404 --> 01:08:51,053
This is where it starts.

791
01:08:51,089 --> 01:08:52,695
Where what starts?

792
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:55,082
Babies mean no sex.

793
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:58,960
That can't be true,
there would be no siblings.

794
01:09:00,232 --> 01:09:02,514
You are funny

795
01:09:02,549 --> 01:09:04,806
No, come on.

796
01:09:04,841 --> 01:09:07,385
Come on, come on.

797
01:09:10,606 --> 01:09:11,997
Hello.

798
01:09:12,331 --> 01:09:14,744
We have an intruder.

799
01:09:17,917 --> 01:09:20,156
You're gonna take her from me, aren't you?

800
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:25,556
You'll see.
You'll choose him over me.

801
01:09:27,048 --> 01:09:29,235
Nobody's choosing anybody.

802
01:09:30,156 --> 01:09:36,120
- And he might be a she.
- Oh Jesus.

803
01:09:56,263 --> 01:09:58,825
<i>ELENA - Good to see you tonight.
I'm here for you, anytime.</i>

804
01:11:13,178 --> 01:11:14,280
Anna.

805
01:11:18,026 --> 01:11:19,340
Anastasia.

806
01:11:25,465 --> 01:11:26,712
Anastasia.

807
01:11:40,947 --> 01:11:42,926
Go through the entire apartment
Check every room.

808
01:11:42,961 --> 01:11:45,287
Taylor, check the garage
See if you can talk to the concierge.

809
01:11:45,312 --> 01:11:47,457
Sawyer take a look at the cc TV.

810
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:51,190
Sawyer,
we're leaving for work in 20 minutes.

811
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:52,524
Yes, ma'am.

812
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,167
Where the hell were you?

813
01:11:57,711 --> 01:11:58,802
Anna.

814
01:12:06,653 --> 01:12:07,896
Anna.

815
01:12:10,615 --> 01:12:12,515
Anastasia.

816
01:12:08,083 --> 01:12:09,809
Open the door.

817
01:12:15,761 --> 01:12:17,384
Anna.

818
01:12:34,581 --> 01:12:36,817
That's it? You are ignoring me?

819
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,929
Hey.

820
01:12:39,486 --> 01:12:41,823
- Why are you behaving like this?
- I don't know.

821
01:12:41,859 --> 01:12:44,277
May be you should go ask
your friend Mrs. Robinson.

822
01:12:44,815 --> 01:12:46,384
What?

823
01:12:47,288 --> 01:12:49,468
You've been reading my texts?

824
01:12:50,149 --> 01:12:51,983
I have been picking up your shit, Christian

825
01:12:52,097 --> 01:12:53,424
I told you, we were just friends.

826
01:12:53,496 --> 01:12:58,143
The time for talking to me was yesterday.
But instead you decided

827
01:12:58,171 --> 01:13:00,030
to go get drunk with
the woman who taught

828
01:13:00,231 --> 01:13:01,954
you how to fuck
when you were a child.

829
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:07,314
The going gets rough, and
you go running to her.

830
01:13:09,324 --> 01:13:12,504
- I thought you were better than that.
- It wasn't like that.

831
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:25,830
- You sleep with her?
- No.

832
01:13:25,896 --> 01:13:28,196
- What do you think? I'll cheat on you?
- You did.

833
01:13:28,386 --> 01:13:29,847
You confided in her.

834
01:13:30,062 --> 01:13:33,778
About our private life,
you chose her over me.

835
01:13:34,654 --> 01:13:37,279
And then you came home.

836
01:13:37,315 --> 01:13:40,643
And you said, I would
choose this baby over you.

837
01:13:41,806 --> 01:13:44,674
You know what?
If I have to, I will.

838
01:13:45,832 --> 01:13:48,281
I will choose this baby
over anybody

839
01:13:48,482 --> 01:13:51,203
because that is what
descent parents do.

840
01:13:52,507 --> 01:13:54,497
It's what your mother
should have done for you

841
01:13:54,697 --> 01:13:56,679
and I am so sorry
that she didn't Christian.

842
01:13:56,780 --> 01:14:01,786
I'm sorry. But you are not
a kid anymore, Christian.

843
01:14:02,399 --> 01:14:05,176
You need to grow the fuck up.

844
01:14:17,256 --> 01:14:21,362
You're not happy about this baby.
I got that.

845
01:14:21,697 --> 01:14:25,489
I'm not ecstatic either given
the timing and your reaction.

846
01:14:25,831 --> 01:14:28,130
But babies happen
when you have sex

847
01:14:28,166 --> 01:14:30,493
and you and I tend to do a lot of that.

848
01:14:31,776 --> 01:14:34,958
So we can either do this together,

849
01:14:35,543 --> 01:14:38,889
or I'll do it without you.

850
01:14:39,248 --> 01:14:40,343
And what about us?

851
01:14:40,544 --> 01:14:43,943
Well, when your husband prefers
the company of his ex mistress,

852
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:46,306
it doesn't really say much
for your marriage. Does it?

853
01:14:46,341 --> 01:14:48,051
Elena and I just talked.

854
01:14:48,294 --> 01:14:51,648
- I was too angry with you.
- I am angry with you Christian,

855
01:14:51,684 --> 01:14:53,013
you left me.

856
01:14:53,048 --> 01:14:55,752
You left me when I needed you.
You fucked up.

857
01:14:56,235 --> 01:14:57,529
I fucked up and I'm sorry.

858
01:14:57,729 --> 01:14:59,769
I am standing here
telling you I'm sorry.

859
01:14:59,948 --> 01:15:01,451
Okay?
She doesn't...

860
01:15:01,812 --> 01:15:03,859
She doesn't mean
anything to me.

861
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:07,972
I don't need her.
I need you.

862
01:15:08,377 --> 01:15:11,415
Would have been good if you
felt that way yesterday.

863
01:15:28,002 --> 01:15:29,703
It turned out so great,
thank you so much.

864
01:15:30,506 --> 01:15:32,345
And if we can just
make the font size

865
01:15:32,546 --> 01:15:34,286
two points bigger
on the hard copy.

866
01:15:39,588 --> 01:15:42,387
Hey, Kate Kavanagh called you three times,

867
01:15:42,388 --> 01:15:43,299
and your husband called,

868
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,816
he wanted me to remind you that
he is flying down to Portland

869
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,342
- but he'll be back this afternoon.
- Is that all he said?

870
01:15:48,559 --> 01:15:49,758
Yeah.

871
01:15:50,347 --> 01:15:52,174
You okay?
Can I get you a latte?

872
01:15:52,404 --> 01:15:54,998
- No thank you.
- Anna Grey's office.

873
01:15:55,034 --> 01:15:57,261
Miss Kavanagh.

874
01:15:57,534 --> 01:16:00,632
Yes, she is, give me one
moment, I'll transfer.

875
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:10,754
- Kate.
- Hey... Christian is looking for you.

876
01:16:10,854 --> 01:16:12,793
He called me at like 6 am.

877
01:16:12,828 --> 01:16:14,729
Ah. It's fine, he found me.

878
01:16:14,964 --> 01:16:17,060
What's going on? You okay?

879
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:20,550
I'm just at work and I'm so busy.
Can I call you back?

880
01:16:20,586 --> 01:16:22,138
Okay.

881
01:16:22,339 --> 01:16:24,342
Hey, you know I am
here for you right?

882
01:16:25,321 --> 01:16:26,700
I know.

883
01:16:27,170 --> 01:16:28,994
Oh Anna.

884
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:32,773
- Kate, don't.
- Talk later?

885
01:16:33,077 --> 01:16:35,437
- Yeah.
- Bye.

886
01:16:59,122 --> 01:17:02,754
<i>- Hi Mia.
- Damn, it's good to hear your voice.</i>

887
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:05,491
Jack.

888
01:17:05,591 --> 01:17:08,327
Never got a chance to talk last week.
How the hell are you?

889
01:17:08,607 --> 01:17:11,378
How are you calling me?
You should be in...

890
01:17:11,479 --> 01:17:12,776
What? In jail?

891
01:17:12,976 --> 01:17:15,170
I'm out on bail, sweetheart.

892
01:17:16,652 --> 01:17:20,049
- This is Mia's phone
- It is, it is.

893
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:21,990
Yeah, Cool spec too.

894
01:17:22,189 --> 01:17:25,891
Zeiss lenses,
20 megapixel camera.

895
01:17:25,927 --> 01:17:27,281
Oh my God.

896
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:29,372
Yeah, I picked her up
outside the gym.

897
01:17:29,407 --> 01:17:32,813
Seems like your husband's
security never learns.

898
01:17:32,849 --> 01:17:34,152
Jack, what do you want?

899
01:17:34,352 --> 01:17:36,901
<i>What do I want?
I want my life back Anna.</i>

900
01:17:36,937 --> 01:17:40,281
I could have been Christian Gray.
I'm smarter.

901
01:17:40,317 --> 01:17:43,857
<i>I have got more balls than him.
He had it so easy.</i>

902
01:17:43,893 --> 01:17:45,934
<i>They should have picked me.</i>

903
01:17:46,396 --> 01:17:47,956
That was supposed to be me.

904
01:17:49,281 --> 01:17:52,495
- These people, they owe me.
- What are you talking about?

905
01:17:53,762 --> 01:17:57,431
Forget about it. If you want
to see your sister-in-law again

906
01:17:57,467 --> 01:18:00,662
Get me five million by 1 pm.

907
01:18:00,951 --> 01:18:04,631
That's in less than two hours
Jack, that's completely impossible.

908
01:18:04,667 --> 01:18:07,310
<i>Oh please,
you are smart enough to take my job,</i>

909
01:18:07,511 --> 01:18:08,775
you'll figure it out.

910
01:18:08,811 --> 01:18:11,264
And don't tell anybody,
not your husband.

911
01:18:11,299 --> 01:18:15,484
<i>Not his security, or you'll get
his little sister back in pieces.</i>

912
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,116
Jesus Jack please.

913
01:18:17,303 --> 01:18:19,785
<i>- Keep your phone with you.
- No, let me talk to Mia.</i>

914
01:18:19,821 --> 01:18:20,863
Jack.

915
01:18:24,628 --> 01:18:26,817
Oh my God.

916
01:18:49,885 --> 01:18:51,150
Hannah.

917
01:18:51,185 --> 01:18:54,921
Please clear my calender for the
rest of the day, I don't feel well.

918
01:18:54,956 --> 01:18:56,494
Sawyer, can you please take me home?

919
01:19:17,397 --> 01:19:20,393
- Yes?
- You know she actually bit me?

920
01:19:21,436 --> 01:19:23,254
I'm kind of turned on right now.

921
01:19:23,652 --> 01:19:25,983
Jesus Christ, Jack, I'm
doing what you asked.

922
01:19:26,019 --> 01:19:27,375
<i>The clock's ticking, Anna.</i>

923
01:19:27,524 --> 01:19:28,995
You need to grab some bags,

924
01:19:29,195 --> 01:19:31,484
5 million in cash
takes up a lot of space.

925
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:33,619
Tick tock.

926
01:20:26,205 --> 01:20:27,574
Yes, Mrs Gray.

927
01:20:27,610 --> 01:20:30,398
Sawyer, can you come help
me in the library please?

928
01:20:30,936 --> 01:20:32,699
On my way.

929
01:20:42,982 --> 01:20:44,315
Mrs Gray?

930
01:20:51,959 --> 01:20:53,544
Mrs. Gray
Anna!

931
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:54,751
Fuck!

932
01:21:05,232 --> 01:21:07,451
She just ran out of the goddamn building.

933
01:21:07,487 --> 01:21:10,690
Fuck!

934
01:21:35,922 --> 01:21:38,289
Mrs. Gray, I am Troy William,
senior Manager.

935
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:39,173
Hi.

936
01:21:39,274 --> 01:21:41,920
Mr. William, I'm very sorry
to bring this on you.

937
01:21:41,956 --> 01:21:44,038
But it's incredibly urgent.

938
01:21:45,141 --> 01:21:49,254
Well, for a large cash
transaction like this one,

939
01:21:49,448 --> 01:21:52,048
we have procedures we have to
follow, so they take time.

940
01:21:52,068 --> 01:21:54,434
I don't have time, I need
the money immediately.

941
01:21:55,869 --> 01:22:00,778
We might be able to... Do
you have identification?

942
01:22:08,066 --> 01:22:10,232
Okay. Thank you.

943
01:22:10,267 --> 01:22:13,615
Now you'll need to write a check
and I have to make a phone call.

944
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:22,197
Mrs. Gray, it's your husband.

945
01:22:37,547 --> 01:22:39,386
- Christian?
- Anna.

946
01:22:39,607 --> 01:22:41,793
What's going on?
What are you doing?

947
01:22:41,828 --> 01:22:43,817
Is this about this morning?

948
01:22:47,136 --> 01:22:50,171
Anna, talk to me.
That's how this works, right?

949
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,009
Tell me what's wrong.

950
01:22:52,543 --> 01:22:54,354
I can't.

951
01:23:00,487 --> 01:23:02,152
Are you leaving me?

952
01:23:08,608 --> 01:23:10,794
Wait for me there, I'll
will be in fifteen minutes.

953
01:23:11,330 --> 01:23:15,037
Christian, please. Don't.

954
01:23:16,410 --> 01:23:18,991
Anna, what's happening?

955
01:23:19,508 --> 01:23:21,047
This doesn't sound like you.

956
01:23:28,171 --> 01:23:29,364
Okay.

957
01:23:30,316 --> 01:23:32,344
Put William back on the phone.

958
01:23:46,338 --> 01:23:47,366
William.

959
01:23:47,466 --> 01:23:49,454
Give her whatever she wants,
do whatever she tells you.

960
01:23:49,489 --> 01:23:51,075
Yes, Mr. Gray

961
01:23:54,416 --> 01:23:57,867
Something's up. Anna's in trouble.
Head for the bank at first, hurry!

962
01:23:58,104 --> 01:23:59,439
Yes sir.

963
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:18,037
Come on baby, pick up.

964
01:24:18,278 --> 01:24:20,052
Pick up, please.

965
01:24:23,484 --> 01:24:26,206
Mrs. Gray,
sorry to keep you waiting.

966
01:24:28,657 --> 01:24:31,650
Sir, your sister Mia is missing

967
01:24:33,763 --> 01:24:35,542
We can't find her.

968
01:24:37,484 --> 01:24:41,374
They are quite heavy, Sam here
will take them to your car.

969
01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:43,788
- Shit.
- Is there a problem?

970
01:24:43,823 --> 01:24:46,272
- Can I make a phone call?

971
01:24:51,147 --> 01:24:55,332
- Cutting it awfully close, Anna?
- Um, I have a problem.

972
01:24:55,683 --> 01:24:58,339
I know. You were
followed to the bank.

973
01:24:58,375 --> 01:24:59,559
How do you know that?

974
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:02,556
There's a blue dodge
parked in the alley

975
01:25:02,591 --> 01:25:04,641
with tinted windows.

976
01:25:04,677 --> 01:25:05,959
Get in. You have 3 minutes.

977
01:25:05,994 --> 01:25:09,238
- No, I need more time than that, Jack.
- Give the driver you cell.

978
01:25:09,274 --> 01:25:11,135
You won't be needing it anymore.

979
01:25:25,383 --> 01:25:27,576
I need to use your emergency exit.

980
01:25:27,611 --> 01:25:30,224
We don't usually.

981
01:25:30,676 --> 01:25:32,464
Yes, Mrs. Gray.

982
01:25:32,681 --> 01:25:34,523
I also need to borrow your phone.

983
01:25:38,530 --> 01:25:39,534
Thank you.

984
01:25:41,741 --> 01:25:44,862
He maid bail,
why wasn't I informed?

985
01:25:45,913 --> 01:25:48,754
Detective the same day that Hyde
gets out, my sister goes missing.

986
01:25:48,856 --> 01:25:51,446
And my wife takes $ 5
million out of our account.

987
01:25:51,482 --> 01:25:52,988
You think that's a coincidence?

988
01:25:55,713 --> 01:25:57,542
Liz

989
01:25:58,072 --> 01:25:59,858
Get in the back.

990
01:26:08,693 --> 01:26:10,054
Phone.

991
01:26:22,030 --> 01:26:25,196
Sir, she is gone.
Picked up in a blue car.

992
01:26:25,414 --> 01:26:28,514
- Damn it.
- Think it the same car that tailed you.

993
01:26:33,358 --> 01:26:34,979
They took her phone,
dropped it in the alley.

994
01:26:34,986 --> 01:26:36,020
It's not her phone.

995
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:38,439
I am tracking her phone
and it's headed east.

996
01:26:42,242 --> 01:26:44,313
Liz, what are you doing?

997
01:26:44,348 --> 01:26:45,687
Why are you doing this?

998
01:26:45,723 --> 01:26:47,723
- Is he paying you?
- Shut up.

999
01:26:47,758 --> 01:26:49,674
South Michigan heading south.

1000
01:26:49,709 --> 01:26:50,802
Dispatch, get that?

1001
01:26:52,096 --> 01:26:54,247
<i>All units be advised. Suspect vehicle</i>

1002
01:26:54,447 --> 01:26:56,715
<i>headed south on 4th through Georgetown.</i>

1003
01:27:00,490 --> 01:27:04,121
Taylor, right here, over the bridge.

1004
01:27:19,381 --> 01:27:20,647
Oh, my God.

1005
01:27:27,518 --> 01:27:28,519
No, no, no.

1006
01:27:28,829 --> 01:27:30,988
You made it 20 minutes to spare.

1007
01:27:31,024 --> 01:27:33,395
Jack, I brought you all the money.
It's all in the car.

1008
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:35,908
- Just let me have Mia.
- We'll get to that.

1009
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:38,701
You loose her phone?
Yeah, in the alley right by the bank.

1010
01:27:41,487 --> 01:27:42,609
Good.

1011
01:27:45,277 --> 01:27:47,631
They stopped, the signal stopped.

1012
01:27:47,667 --> 01:27:49,102
Carrie street north,
ten blocks, hurry.

1013
01:27:49,126 --> 01:27:51,963
<i>We have two units
converging on that area.</i>

1014
01:27:51,998 --> 01:27:53,249
<i>Going through in 3 minutes.</i>

1015
01:27:56,855 --> 01:27:58,701
Jack, please just let us go.

1016
01:28:00,757 --> 01:28:03,278
That's for you stuck up little bitch.

1017
01:28:03,313 --> 01:28:05,333
Thanks for fuckin' up my life.

1018
01:28:07,302 --> 01:28:09,455
Jesus, Jack, stop.

1019
01:28:09,490 --> 01:28:11,995
I did what you wanted, I gave
you what you asked for.

1020
01:28:12,031 --> 01:28:13,711
You think you can humiliate me?

1021
01:28:13,747 --> 01:28:15,433
- No.
- You bitch.

1022
01:28:15,469 --> 01:28:19,195
- Where's Christian now Anna?
- Jack, don't.

1023
01:28:19,479 --> 01:28:23,280
- You said you wouldn't kill her.
- And she's not dead, not yet.

1024
01:28:23,442 --> 01:28:24,792
You have the money. Leave her alone.

1025
01:28:24,993 --> 01:28:26,531
Fuck the money.
I don't give a shit about the money.

1026
01:28:26,543 --> 01:28:27,944
Enough.

1027
01:28:43,367 --> 01:28:44,902
Taylor, grab Mia.

1028
01:28:45,135 --> 01:28:49,073
Anna, Anna, Anna,
can you hear me?

1029
01:28:52,488 --> 01:28:55,885
Wait...
Stay with me, Anna.

1030
01:28:56,192 --> 01:28:58,750
Anna.

1031
01:28:59,848 --> 01:29:02,993
Please be careful,
she's pregnant.

1032
01:29:06,182 --> 01:29:08,874
Please, stay back, Mr Grey.
Let us help your wife.

1033
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:45,021
I am still awful to her, mom.

1034
01:29:45,237 --> 01:29:47,814
The things I said, I
wanna take 'em all back.

1035
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:51,472
Sweetheart.

1036
01:29:51,650 --> 01:29:53,832
If there was no room in
marriage for mistakes

1037
01:29:54,033 --> 01:29:56,116
none of them would last
more than a week.

1038
01:29:57,394 --> 01:29:59,226
Tell her you are sorry.

1039
01:29:59,433 --> 01:30:02,806
You mean it,
then give her little time.

1040
01:30:04,014 --> 01:30:06,424
But I thought
she was leaving me.

1041
01:30:07,031 --> 01:30:08,658
Not this one.

1042
01:30:08,903 --> 01:30:11,047
She is tenacious.

1043
01:30:11,648 --> 01:30:14,062
Especially about things that she loves.

1044
01:30:14,263 --> 01:30:16,306
And she does love you, Christian.

1045
01:30:18,278 --> 01:30:20,672
You know that, don't you?

1046
01:30:21,184 --> 01:30:24,097
Yeah, yeah I do.

1047
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:25,394
Good.

1048
01:30:30,596 --> 01:30:32,271
Oh, my sweetheart.

1049
01:30:44,996 --> 01:30:47,650
- Anastasia.
- I will call Doctor.

1050
01:30:47,889 --> 01:30:51,185
Hey, how are you feeling?

1051
01:30:53,405 --> 01:30:56,966
- How is the baby?
- The baby is fine.

1052
01:30:58,354 --> 01:31:01,931
The baby's fine,
thank God!

1053
01:31:04,953 --> 01:31:07,000
Is Mia okay?

1054
01:31:07,036 --> 01:31:08,482
Yes.

1055
01:31:08,855 --> 01:31:10,570
Mia's fine.

1056
01:31:26,892 --> 01:31:29,937
Anna, I wanna have
this baby with you.

1057
01:31:30,665 --> 01:31:32,486
I was just scared.

1058
01:31:33,661 --> 01:31:36,992
I wanted your world to
begin and end with me.

1059
01:31:37,464 --> 01:31:39,997
It does.

1060
01:31:41,354 --> 01:31:44,708
Christian, it does.
You're my whole life.

1061
01:31:49,282 --> 01:31:51,289
Are you crying?

1062
01:31:51,855 --> 01:31:53,612
Come here.

1063
01:32:09,505 --> 01:32:11,563
Why didn't ' you tell me
what was going on?

1064
01:32:13,942 --> 01:32:17,859
I couldn't.
Jack threatened me.

1065
01:32:17,942 --> 01:32:19,791
What happened to him?

1066
01:32:20,046 --> 01:32:21,503
He will live.

1067
01:32:22,205 --> 01:32:25,907
- I can't believe, I shot somebody.
- Should have aimed higher.

1068
01:32:29,043 --> 01:32:31,207
Liz was helping him.

1069
01:32:31,514 --> 01:32:35,423
Blackmailed.
She had sex with Hyde and he filmed it.

1070
01:32:35,660 --> 01:32:38,228
Seems he did that
with all this assistance.

1071
01:32:39,262 --> 01:32:40,647
Oh my God!

1072
01:32:46,483 --> 01:32:50,567
I know you think
you're gonna be a really shitty dad.

1073
01:32:51,847 --> 01:32:54,171
But you are not.

1074
01:32:55,242 --> 01:32:57,766
This baby is gonna love you.

1075
01:32:58,822 --> 01:33:00,702
Unconditionally.

1076
01:33:03,809 --> 01:33:06,195
Just like you loved your mother.

1077
01:33:08,641 --> 01:33:10,505
You just have to forgive her.

1078
01:33:16,895 --> 01:33:19,471
<i>What is happening?
Are you cooking?</i>

1079
01:33:20,565 --> 01:33:22,814
Yeah, I got this.

1080
01:33:23,397 --> 01:33:25,295
Prepare to be amazed.

1081
01:33:33,773 --> 01:33:36,781
- What is this?
- It's more information of Hyde.

1082
01:33:37,074 --> 01:33:39,110
Open it.

1083
01:33:44,951 --> 01:33:46,930
Look at his foster family.

1084
01:33:53,623 --> 01:33:56,408
That's Hyde.
That's me.

1085
01:33:56,443 --> 01:33:58,297
You were in a
Forster care with him?

1086
01:33:58,332 --> 01:33:59,813
I must have been.

1087
01:34:00,162 --> 01:34:03,271
Do you remember these people,
do you know these kids?

1088
01:34:03,306 --> 01:34:06,245
I barely remember anything before
I was adopted, I was too young.

1089
01:34:06,495 --> 01:34:09,544
That must have been what he meant
when he said you owe him a life.

1090
01:34:09,763 --> 01:34:12,318
Because your parents
adopted you and not him.

1091
01:34:22,193 --> 01:34:23,850
What's going on?

1092
01:34:26,472 --> 01:34:28,609
If I'd been left in the system

1093
01:34:30,829 --> 01:34:33,007
who knows how I'd have turned out?

1094
01:34:33,577 --> 01:34:36,169
That could be me, maybe
that should have been me.

1095
01:34:36,448 --> 01:34:38,516
Hey, no.

1096
01:34:38,771 --> 01:34:41,233
You are nothing like him.

1097
01:34:42,958 --> 01:34:46,020
You were given a life
with advantages, yes...

1098
01:34:46,055 --> 01:34:47,215
but

1099
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:49,474
look what you made of it.

1100
01:34:50,979 --> 01:34:52,961
You're man of honor.

1101
01:34:54,403 --> 01:34:56,842
And you treat people well.

1102
01:34:57,571 --> 01:34:59,084
You care.

1103
01:34:59,138 --> 01:35:01,896
No one could ever say that
about a man like Hyde.

1104
01:35:01,932 --> 01:35:03,164
No matter who raised him.

1105
01:35:07,848 --> 01:35:09,630
I love you.

1106
01:35:11,439 --> 01:35:14,310
Yeah, if you could only cook,
you'd be perfect.

1107
01:35:14,494 --> 01:35:16,112
Oh God, okay...

1108
01:35:20,076 --> 01:35:22,535
Fuck it, let's get take out.

1109
01:35:30,181 --> 01:35:31,842
- Christian
- Yeah?

1110
01:35:32,732 --> 01:35:36,799
It seems like they have found where
your birth mother is buried.

1111
01:37:59,126 --> 01:38:02,519
<i>Sir, I await your pleasure.</i>

1112
01:38:15,294 --> 01:38:17,019
So you wanna play?

1113
01:38:18,070 --> 01:38:19,655
Yes sir.

1114
01:38:26,789 --> 01:38:29,270
You're tapping from
the bottom, Mrs. Gray.

1115
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:34,141
But I can live with that.

1116
01:38:37,991 --> 01:38:42,550
Subtitled by Disha Lover

1117
01:39:05,854 --> 01:39:09,712
<i>There she is, now give a big kiss OK?
Give mommy a big kiss.</i>

1118
01:39:09,747 --> 01:39:14,027
<i>Come here... Hi!</i>
