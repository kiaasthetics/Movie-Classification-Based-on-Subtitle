1
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,039
Andrew!

2
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,002
Andrew!

3
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,762
Andrew!

4
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,311
No!

5
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,434
Andrew!

6
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,444
No!

7
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,412
<i>Thousands gathered
in the Bay Area last night</i>

8
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,225
<i>to honor the victims
of the 2014 attacks.</i>

9
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:51,652
<i>Part of a wave of memorials and protests
demanding that the secretive...</i>

10
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:55,447
<i>...monster-hunting coalition
known as Monarch be held accountable.</i>

11
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:58,817
<i>The recent spike in mass die-offs
in the world's oceans</i>

12
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,903
<i>could be caused by efforts to locate
and track Godzilla,</i>

13
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,656
<i>who hasn't been seen in over five years.</i>

14
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,158
<i>Top brass at the mysterious
Monarch organization</i>

15
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:10,745
<i>will face another intense grilling
as the government continues</i>

16
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:14,420
<i>to push for extermination of the Titans.
And rumors persist</i>

17
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,217
<i>that Monarch may be hiding
even more creatures discovered</i>

18
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,591
<i>since the attacks of 2014.</i>

19
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,887
<i>A historic tragedy that changed
the world as we know it forever.</i>

20
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:27,392
<i>The day the world discovered
that monsters are real.</i>

21
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:01,931
Shit!

22
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,640
Shit, shit, shit!

23
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,767
- Oh...
- Maddie?

24
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,895
Good morning!

25
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,349
- Good morning, Mom!
- Oh, God!

26
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,639
- Uh...
- Okay.

27
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,851
I made us breakfast.

28
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,653
It's, uh...

29
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:20,649
eggs, toast, and what was once bacon.

30
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,110
And which do you recommend?

31
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,486
The toast and eggs.

32
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,447
Thank you.

33
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,122
Coffee?

34
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,835
What were you working on?

35
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,709
Um, I was looking at recipes.

36
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,798
For toast?

37
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,427
Dad's been emailing me.

38
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,436
But he looks good.

39
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,643
Healthy.

40
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,180
Have you responded?

41
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,937
Not yet.

42
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,892
Madison, I just
don't want to see you get hurt.

43
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,523
- I know.
- Especially with everything

44
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,650
- that's going on right now.
- Mom, I know.

45
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,078
Listen, I know
things haven't been easy for you.

46
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,914
But we're gonna get through this.

47
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,501
Together.

48
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,876
You sure he's gonna be okay?

49
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:18,548
He is in the safest place
that he could be right now.

50
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,127
You wanna hear some good news?

51
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,380
I finished it.

52
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:26,968
Really?

53
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,052
You think it's gonna work?

54
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,138
It's gonna work.

55
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:56,873
It's gonna be okay.

56
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,382
<i>Dr. Russell,
we need you in Containment.</i>

57
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,214
I'm on my way.

58
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,774
- What the hell happened?
- No idea.

59
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,339
She was sleeping like a baby
until an hour ago, and then, boom.

60
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,070
Her radiation levels
went through the roof.

61
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,647
Almost like something triggered it.

62
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,073
Thanks, Tim. You know,

63
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,012
I can take it from here.
Why don't you get some rest?

64
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,949
No way. Sleep or no sleep,
I'm not missing this.

65
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,712
<i>Containment Team,
move into primary position.</i>

66
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,406
- Sedatives?
- No effect.

67
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,925
This thing wants to be born.

68
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,476
<i>Emergency protocol is in effect.</i>

69
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,725
<i>Ten seconds to biocontainment.</i>

70
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,355
Her time has come.

71
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,761
Meet <i>Titanus mosura.</i>

72
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,384
Or as we like to call her...

73
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,593
Mothra.

74
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,637
Incredible.

75
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,729
<i>Activating containment grid.</i>

76
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,303
- <i>Warning.</i>
- What's happening?

77
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,058
- <i>Warning.</i>
- Something's really wrong here.

78
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,362
Containment systems are failing.

79
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,187
Perimeter alarms are going off,
the whole network's going insane.

80
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,606
What do you mean?
How is that possible?

81
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,230
Emma, I think
someone else is doing this.

82
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,488
<i>Containment Team, stand down.</i>

83
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,253
I repeat, stand down.
You are scaring her.

84
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,516
- No!
- Dr. Russell, I'm sorry.

85
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,228
But you know the protocols.
We have to terminate!

86
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,288
I'll handle this.

87
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:44,919
Mom! No!

88
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,373
Madison, stay here. It's gonna work.

89
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,387
<i>Stand clear.</i>

90
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,096
It's okay.

91
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,311
Mom!

92
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,230
Mom!

93
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:50,946
Maddie, wait!

94
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,738
Maddie!

95
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,616
Get back in here!

96
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,202
Maddie! Go back!

97
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:00,873
Mom! Let's go!

98
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,210
Mom!

99
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,196
Son of a bitch.

100
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,248
It worked.

101
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,556
Mom?

102
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,941
What we are witnessing here, Senators,

103
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:04,699
is the return of an ancient
and forgotten super species.

104
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:08,408
Godzilla, the MUTOs, Kong.

105
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:12,120
We believe that these "Titans"
and others like them

106
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,172
provide an essential balance
to our world.

107
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,170
And while some may pose a threat,

108
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,545
Monarch is uniquely prepared
to determine

109
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,255
which of these Titans are here
to threaten us

110
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,932
and which of these Titans are here
to protect us.

111
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,932
Thank you for the fifth grade
history lesson, Mr. Coleman.

112
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,730
But we still haven't heard
one good reason

113
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,934
why Monarch shouldn't fall under
militaryjurisdiction.

114
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,732
Or why these creatures
shouldn't be exterminated.

115
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,690
Monarch was tasked
with finding and destroying

116
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:45,035
these radioactive monsters.
But you either can't or won't tell us

117
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,997
how many there are
or why they're showing up.

118
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:51,416
So, maybe it's time for the military
to put them down.

119
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,494
Killing them
would be a mistake.

120
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,754
They returned because of us.

121
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,880
It was our atomic testing
that awoke <i>Gojira.</i>

122
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:05,177
Other creatures like the MUTOs
from strip mining and seismic surveys.

123
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,641
But these are not monsters.

124
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:11,220
They are animals rising to reclaim
a world that was once theirs.

125
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,890
It almost sounds like
you're protecting them, Dr. Serizawa.

126
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,191
As if you admire them.

127
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:19,320
I admire all forms of life.

128
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,489
Senators, if we hope to survive,

129
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:26,323
we must find ways
to coexist with Titans.

130
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,529
With <i>Gojira.</i>

131
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,832
A sort of symbiotic relationship,
if you will.

132
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,584
Like the lion and the mouse.

133
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,920
Or the scorpion and the frog.

134
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,749
So you'd want to make Godzilla our pet?

135
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,458
No.

136
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,009
We will be his.

137
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,471
Uh... No. No, actually.

138
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,003
That's not what Dr. Serizawa meant.

139
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,303
- We have to go.
- No one is implying that we would be...

140
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,252
- Sam, we have to go.
- Godzilla's or anyone's pet.

141
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:59,314
Dr. Serizawa, Dr. Graham,
this hearing is not adjourned.

142
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,729
Dr. Serizawa, I hope you understand

143
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,823
the consequences
of walking out that door.

144
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,822
Uh, you know what, Senators,
while I confer with my colleagues here,

145
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:11,076
I'm gonna set you up with a very brief
and pretty fun documentary

146
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,451
on Titan reproduction.

147
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,862
I think this is the one
where the genitals are blurred out.

148
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,208
But if not, you can leave
a comment with my assistant.

149
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,549
The feed cuts out there.

150
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:23,853
The survivors haven't been able

151
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,359
to give us much more
than what the footage allows.

152
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:29,571
Only that Emma and Madison
were the only ones taken.

153
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,820
I'm sorry, Mark.

154
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,030
I should've been there for her.

155
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,330
- Who are they?
- We don't know yet.

156
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:44,131
We believe they were after this.

157
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:47,884
You didn't.

158
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,469
It's the ORCA.

159
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,304
That's why we think they need Emma.

160
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,508
She believed
that if we could somehow replicate

161
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,558
the biosonar the Titans use
to communicate...

162
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,887
I know what the hell it is.
I helped build the prototype.

163
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,264
Who is he?

164
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,520
Uh, Sam Coleman.
I'm the head of technology.

165
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,068
I joined Monarch,
uh, shortly after you left.

166
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,067
I'm a big fan of your wife's work.
And you.

167
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,023
That just came out so weird, I'm sorry.

168
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,529
Emma and I destroyed the prototype.

169
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,986
And then Emma decided to rebuild it.

170
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:18,741
After San Francisco, she went home
to Boston, spent years developing it.

171
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,083
She thought it could help...

172
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:21,251
Would help what? Play God?

173
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,981
No.
Help prevent another attack.

174
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,917
ORCA was a grad school science project.

175
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,374
It was meant to keep whales
away from the shoreline.

176
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,750
Not so you could talk
to your little creatures out there.

177
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,634
Listen to me,
they'll think it's one of them.

178
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,594
You use the wrong frequency
on one of 'em,

179
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,890
and you're gonna be responsible
for 1,000 San Franciscos.

180
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,972
Which is why we need to get it back.

181
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:45,351
Emma always said
no one knew the ORCA better than you.

182
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,436
It shouldn't even exist.

183
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:51,232
That may be, Mark.
But it's fallen into the wrong hands.

184
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,362
And right now,
the ORCA is the only thing

185
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,952
keeping Emma and Madison alive.

186
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,326
Mark, we know you're hurting.

187
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,533
But if we find the ORCA,
we'll find your family.

188
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,129
I promise.

189
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,427
<i>When was the last time
you spoke to Emma?</i>

190
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:18,934
About three years ago.

191
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,554
After San Francisco

192
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,351
we went back home to Boston.

193
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,019
Tried to put the pieces back together.

194
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,404
Emma dealt with it by doubling down
on saving the world

195
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,074
and I started drinking.

196
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:40,782
I can't tell you how much I hated myself
for letting Maddie see me that way.

197
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,868
Uh, you mind if we cut in here?

198
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,921
It's just, you're gonna wanna see this.

199
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,462
Emma combined the bioacoustics

200
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,761
of different Titans
to create the ORCA's signal.

201
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:58,515
A sort of baseline frequency
that all the creatures respond to.

202
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:03,187
Attracting them, repelling them,
even at times calming them down.

203
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,138
It's pretty remarkable actually.

204
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:08,146
The problem is
we don't know which Titans she combined.

205
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:11,320
But if you can identify
those frequencies,

206
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:15,490
we'll be able to track the ORCA
and find Emma and Madison.

207
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,576
Jesus!

208
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,444
How many of these things are there?

209
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,618
Seventeen and counting after <i>Gojira.</i>

210
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,866
Seventeen?

211
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,921
Most of them were discovered
in deep hibernation.

212
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:29,622
While others, we've contained
at top secret sites around the globe.

213
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:34,881
Cambodia, Mexico, Skull Island.
We even found one in Wyoming.

214
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,219
They're everywhere.

215
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,508
Why don't you kill 'em?

216
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,427
The government wants to.

217
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,681
But Emma and I believe
some are benevolent.

218
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:47,560
Don't kid yourself.

219
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,686
Uh... Hey, look at that. We're here.

220
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,496
<i>Castle Bravo, this is Raptor One.
On direct approach.</i>

221
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:17,086
<i>Raptor One, you are cleared
for assisted descent to pad four.</i>

222
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:29,015
<i>Sensors set for three meters.
Beginning sub-surface descent.</i>

223
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,644
This is new.

224
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,694
Yeah, we call it Castle Bravo.
Our new flagship facility,

225
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,777
built to track and study Godzilla
on his own turf.

226
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,578
I thought he was missing.

227
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,914
Well, only if you don't know
where to look.

228
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,841
As you know, at approximately 0700 hours

229
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,514
our containment site in China's
Yunnan Rainforest was raided.

230
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,056
The specimen, code name Mothra, escaped.

231
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:10,522
Only to cocoon itself later
under a nearby waterfall.

232
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:15,228
While Dr. Emma Russell and
her daughter Madison were taken hostage.

233
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:19,315
This is the man responsible, Alan Jonah.

234
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,321
A former British army colonel
turned ecoterrorist.

235
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:25,196
Obsessed with restoring natural order.

236
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,655
And to fund his operations,

237
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,034
he began trafficking
in a new and dangerous market.

238
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,002
Titan DNA.

239
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,940
What the hell is someone gonna do
with a giant worm?

240
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,109
Are you kidding, Martinez?
What can't you do with it?

241
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,171
Pharmaceuticals, bioweapons, food...

242
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,299
Hell, there isn't a country or a company
on the planet

243
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,723
that doesn't wanna get its hands
on one of these suckers.

244
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,222
And remember, this is just a larva.

245
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,552
That's a baby.

246
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:52,060
After it cocoons,
something else is gonna crawl out.

247
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,732
Something bigger, meaner...

248
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,463
- We don't know that, Rick.
- Oh, yeah?

249
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,399
Just wait for it, Chen.

250
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:02,241
Our intel indicates that Jonah
wants to capture this specimen.

251
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,237
Alive.

252
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,035
Which means that he and his mercs
won't be far behind.

253
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:09,365
At 0500, we'll ship out
to launch a joint operation...

254
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,786
I wouldn't bother.

255
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:11,749
Excuse me?

256
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,105
Sounds like a duck hunt to me.

257
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,212
Uh, Mark, why don't we let
Colonel Foster finish...

258
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,833
A decoy. A diversion.

259
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,882
Look, they've already got Emma
and the ORCA.

260
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,197
Why would they want just this one
when they've got the keys

261
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,885
to your entire magic kingdom
of horrors back here?

262
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,308
I think that they want you
to go after this Mothra,

263
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,386
so they can go after a real prize.

264
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:31,557
Something bigger.

265
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,684
Right.

266
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:37,564
Mark, this is not the first specimen
they've captured.

267
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,006
- They know what they are doing.
- That's not just a specimen.

268
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,364
I've got an ex-wife and a daughter
out there, in case you forgot.

269
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:47,035
No. No one has forgotten that, Mark,
but, uh, to remind you,

270
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:50,080
you were brought on here to help track
the ORCA, and to advise us...

271
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,534
I advise you to kill these things.
All of 'em.

272
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,627
Especially him.

273
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,524
You wanna make sure these things
don't fall into the wrong hands?

274
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,631
You kill them and the ORCA's useless.

275
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:03,301
Emma wouldn't have wanted that.
Even to save her life.

276
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:07,472
Well, it wouldn't be the first time
Emma put all of this before herself

277
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,220
or her family, would it?

278
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,605
Dude hates Titans.

279
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,399
Yeah, well, you would too,
if you were him.

280
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,282
<i>Outpost 32,
this is Raptor Five,</i>

281
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,155
<i>on approach
with reinforcements and supplies.</i>

282
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,653
<i>Requesting permission to land.</i>

283
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:34,746
<i>Serizawa has all sites on high alert,
so transmitting emergency codes now.</i>

284
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,246
<i>Copy that, Raptor Five.</i>

285
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,037
<i>Codes are good. Nice to have you back.</i>

286
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,263
Go.

287
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:54,935
It's good to see ya.

288
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:57,021
- Need a hand with offload?
- No, we're good!

289
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,714
We're gonna put it over
at bay five.

290
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,321
- Follow me!
- Go back up! Hey, hey!

291
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,194
Leave them, let's go!

292
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:16,541
I'm scared.

293
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,163
I know. Me, too.

294
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:23,883
Okay.

295
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,759
Let's go.

296
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,016
Eyes straight ahead.

297
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,857
Deep breaths.

298
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,396
Just like we talked about.

299
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,716
Hmm.

300
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,359
Mother of God.

301
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,529
She had nothing to do with this.

302
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,906
Monster Zero.

303
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,605
Any survivors?

304
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:04,975
No. They tried to launch
an emergency beacon,

305
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,651
but we cut them off in time.

306
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,145
They'll figure it out.

307
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,524
Fire up the drills.

308
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,008
Do you have everything you need?

309
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,360
Good.

310
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,196
Well, let's get started.

311
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,118
Further.

312
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:47,101
<i>We have a grizzly situation
up here in the attic.</i>

313
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,856
<i>Come on, Andrew. Andrew.</i>

314
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:51,549
- <i>I've come to eat your horses.
- No, you can't eat my horses...</i>

315
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,689
<i>That's not...</i>

316
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:54,409
<i>Stop.</i>

317
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,451
<i>Look.</i>

318
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,826
<i>- An intruder! Get her!
- Get her!</i>

319
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,713
<i>- Get her! Get her!
- No, don't get me!</i>

320
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,241
<i>Andrew, Madison! Get her!</i>

321
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,166
- <i>Get her!
- Bear kisses.</i>

322
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,379
<i>Bear kisses!</i>

323
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:20,225
<i>All personnel,
report to battle stations. Code red.</i>

324
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,603
<i>All personnel,
report to battle stations.</i>

325
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,430
<i>- Code red.</i>
- At least 60 knots.

326
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:29,484
<i>This is not a drill. All personnel,
report to battle stations.</i>

327
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,607
<i>Code red.</i>

328
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:34,656
What's happening?

329
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:35,903
Something's wrong.

330
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,905
He's never been this close before.

331
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,782
- Who's he?
- Who do you think?

332
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,831
He's taking out our observation drones.

333
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:45,283
Trajectory?

334
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,120
Straight at us!
1,200 meters and closing.

335
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:52,461
G-Team. Barnes, Martinez, Hendricks,
I want you on those CROWS now!

336
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,588
You heard boss lady! Let's move!

337
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:07,014
Dr. Stanton.
Do you have his bioacoustics?

338
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,310
Acoustics coming up!

339
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,939
Okay, he's closing. We're at 800 meters!

340
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,049
His movements are erratic.

341
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,439
Heart and breathing elevated.

342
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,694
Yeah, he's definitely not happy
about something.

343
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,700
How are they getting all this?

344
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:22,780
Emma isolated Godzilla's bioacoustics.

345
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:24,914
It allows us to track him.

346
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,408
Even to get his vitals.

347
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:32,748
Circling now, closing in, 200 meters.

348
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,666
Colonel!

349
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:37,715
All teams in position, weapons hot,
ready to engage on my command.

350
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,847
Come on, come on, come on.

351
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,053
Hold your fire.

352
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,801
We don't know he'll attack.

353
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,603
He will if you keep those guns on him.

354
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,668
Now I want him dead more than anybody,
but unless this is a fight that you know

355
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,479
that you can win,
for God's sake, stand down.

356
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,325
Stand down.

357
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,785
You can't be serious.

358
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:03,913
I am.

359
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,581
Stand down.

360
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:09,877
Stand down.

361
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,420
I say again, safe your weapons.
Do not engage.

362
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,219
Listen.

363
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,797
His heart rate, it's slowing.

364
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,309
Open the shields.

365
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,483
Oh, yeah, sure.
Let's bring him in for a beer.

366
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,402
You out of your goddamn mind?

367
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:38,863
Let him know we're not a threat.

368
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,611
Open the shields.

369
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:48,541
Do it.

370
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,651
Hey, what's with the light show?

371
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,324
It's an intimidation display.

372
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,165
Like a gorilla pounding his chest.

373
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,083
Consider us very

374
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,498
intimidated.

375
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,377
I don't think it's for us.

376
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,678
What are you doing, dude?

377
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,367
Well, that was interesting.

378
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,756
Jesus!

379
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:32,260
Can we maybe close the shield now?

380
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,181
Show me his territorial routes.

381
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,391
What? Why?

382
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,646
Because I wanna start a boat tour.
Just show me.

383
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:40,936
Okay. Coming up.

384
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,942
You care to tell us
what you're looking for?

385
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,954
When an animal leaves
its hunting ground,

386
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:47,762
it's usually because it's threatened
by something.

387
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,786
Run a course projection.

388
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,862
We gotta go after him.

389
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,788
He's looking for something out there.

390
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,999
It could be the ORCA.

391
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,629
Dr. Stanton, what's your projection?

392
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:03,459
All paths have him landing
in the same place.

393
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,301
Antarctica.

394
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,678
Good, then.

395
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,677
I mean, let's go!
Let's go find him. Let's...

396
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:14,765
Wait, what's in Antarctica?

397
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,764
Barnes, contact the <i>Argo.</i>

398
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:19,478
Yes, ma'am.

399
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:34,823
The specimen at this site
has been kept entirely off-book.

400
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:38,455
And since it's a more recent discovery,
our data is limited.

401
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:42,001
But it seems to be
another apex predator.

402
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,582
Emma called it Monster Zero.

403
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:47,176
It may have been
a rival alpha to Godzilla.

404
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,720
Battling for dominance
over the other Titans.

405
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,009
Dr. Chen?

406
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:53,758
I've been scouring
through thousands of years

407
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,309
of myths and legends.

408
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:59,522
But it's almost as if people were scared
to even write about it.

409
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,641
As if it was meant to be forgotten.

410
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:04,523
Sorry, I hate to crash a party,
but I got some bad news.

411
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,361
You could just say news.
It's always bad.

412
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,490
We lost Godzilla.

413
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,440
He dropped off the scan near Venezuela.

414
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:10,449
Dropped off?

415
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,055
I'm telling you, Dr. Brooks was right.

416
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,195
It's a Hollow Earth.

417
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,364
That's how he moves around so fast,

418
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:18,583
using these underwater tunnels
like wormholes.

419
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,999
- Just like, zippin' around.
- Everyone look sharp.

420
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,837
We're approaching the base.

421
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,304
- They're here.
- Keep 'em busy.

422
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:38,769
Launch reaction force. Move out!

423
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,934
All right, gents!
Got the green light!

424
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,482
Go! Right there, right there.
Nine o'clock. And cross!

425
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,979
And you, go down!

426
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,378
If Jonah is looking
to extract genetic samples,

427
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,668
they'll be here in the bio labs.

428
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:08,670
All right, two minutes.

429
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:10,589
Check your equipment, stand by the door.

430
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,322
Come on, Ash. Make it snappy.

431
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,200
- Detonator ready.
- Let's go.

432
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,614
Come on, Maddie.

433
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:37,746
Move! Move!

434
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,599
Remember, eyes wide.
We got friendlies in here.

435
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,686
<i>Move to tunnel two.</i>

436
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:03,979
<i>Stay on overwatch.</i>

437
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,356
<i>Roger that, Chief.</i>

438
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,372
<i>Ambush! Ambush!</i>

439
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,707
Team under fire! 360 ambush!

440
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,334
<i>We're taking heavy losses.</i>

441
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,262
Break right!

442
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,077
<i>Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
We got friendlies!</i>

443
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,101
<i>No!</i>

444
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,270
Mark?

445
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,210
Get down there and help Barnes.
I'm going after him.

446
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,234
Roger that.

447
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:05,207
Hey, guys. I'm getting an EKG reading.

448
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,630
Emma?

449
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:13,298
Maddie!

450
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,171
Number one, let's go.

451
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,513
Barnes, this is Foster.

452
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:27,063
I've got eyes on the target.
Repeat, eyes on the target.

453
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:33,940
Let 'em go!

454
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,365
- Ash!
- Dad!

455
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,196
- Mark.
- Emma, Madison, let's go.

456
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,412
Dad.

457
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,769
- Let's go. Emma, Maddie, come on.
- Daddy?

458
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,534
Madison, walk to me.

459
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:51,455
Walk to me now. Come on, honey.

460
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:53,359
Barnes, I've got two hostages,
one target down.

461
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:54,860
- Now! Come on, Maddie.
<i>- I do not have a shot.</i>

462
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,796
<i>Repeat, I do not have a shot.</i>

463
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,531
Emma, what are you doing?
Let's go. Come on!

464
00:34:58,555 --> 00:34:59,921
- Dad.
- Maddie.

465
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,182
Dad.

466
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,386
Madison.

467
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,083
What the hell?

468
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:43,757
I'm sorry.

469
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,519
Run.

470
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:03,952
Maddie!

471
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,330
Dad!

472
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,161
Move, move!

473
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,621
- Foster!
- Get out of the way!

474
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:29,805
Hang in there. Jam the doors!

475
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,307
- Let's go!
- Hang on! Move!

476
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,555
Hendricks, on the double!

477
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,449
- I got you, Colonel!
- Get her legs!

478
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:37,695
We gotta go!

479
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,284
Damn it!

480
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:54,285
Martinez, Foster, let's go!

481
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:55,379
Move, move! Now!

482
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:00,458
Okay, let's go!

483
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,802
No checklist this time.

484
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,637
- Right.
- We're up.

485
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,677
- What is Dad doing here?
- I don't know, honey.

486
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,641
Let's go.

487
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,388
We can't leave him.

488
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:14,885
What are you waiting for?

489
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,316
Wake it up.

490
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:30,746
Launch is up ahead!

491
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,073
Let's go! Move it!

492
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,091
Keep going!

493
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,178
Go, go, go!

494
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,418
You gotta be fucking kidding.

495
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:13,925
Fall back! Fall back!

496
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,594
Get to the chopper!

497
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,314
Go, go, go!

498
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,148
Keep it going!

499
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:26,069
Come on!

500
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,771
Hurry up, men!

501
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,025
Open fire!

502
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:40,959
Get in!

503
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,625
We'll do an emergency
vertical take-off at max RPM.

504
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:44,956
Number two's still spinning up.

505
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:00,145
Oh, shit.

506
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,837
This is Raptor One to <i>Argo.</i>

507
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,422
Requesting immediate urgent extract.

508
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,750
Again, I say urgent extract.

509
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,366
Griffin, get us the hell out of here!

510
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,006
Madison!

511
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,011
Madison, no!

512
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,814
- You need to let go of it!
- No! No! No!

513
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,778
- Madison!
- Maddie! Let go!

514
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:50,906
No!

515
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,019
<i>Argo,</i> this is Raptor One.
We've been hit. All systems are down.

516
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:29,981
Look out!

517
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,150
Everybody, hold on!

518
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,589
Mark!

519
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,132
Everybody, clear out. Let's go!

520
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,550
Go! Go!

521
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,242
- Mark!
- I'm stuck.

522
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:42,325
Are you all right?

523
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,240
I got it! I got it. Go, go!

524
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:36,022
Anything on the satellites?

525
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,316
Subs have Godzilla
hauling ass off Argentina.

526
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,861
We lost Monster Zero
in a tropical storm over Brazil.

527
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,989
Scanning the entire Southern Hemisphere.
So far, nothing.

528
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:47,489
- Then scan the Northern.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

529
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,035
I know what I saw, Sam.

530
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,496
And I'm telling you,
she pulled that trigger.

531
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:53,286
All due respect, Colonel, you saw wrong.

532
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,749
Okay? She wouldn't have done it.

533
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,369
Christ, she recruited
pretty much everyone in this room.

534
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:59,667
Maybe Jonah forced her, right?

535
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,794
Maybe he used Madison as leverage.

536
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,153
No, no. It had to be someone else.

537
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,177
Emma.

538
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,133
It was Emma.

539
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,095
Foster saw it right.

540
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,476
It was her. No one forced her to.

541
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:14,720
Are you sure?

542
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,598
First, she releases Mothra.

543
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,475
And now Monster Zero.

544
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,107
Anyone else sensing a pattern here?

545
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,779
Yes, and not a good one.

546
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:27,448
It's as if she is trying
to start a mass awakening.

547
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,818
Well, it's just too bad
that no one tried

548
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,472
to warn you that that was gonna happen.

549
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,994
Hang on, guys. Why the hell
would she want to release them?

550
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:38,577
And why would she team up with Jonah,
of all people, to do it?

551
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:39,713
We'll ask her

552
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:41,630
when we find her.

553
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,963
So, let's keep looking.

554
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:02,045
<i>Godzilla appears
to be following</i>

555
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,106
the same path as Emma's osprey,

556
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,529
heading north
over South America to here.

557
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:09,483
Outpost 56 in Isla de Mara, Mexico.

558
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:11,489
We touch down there in 10 minutes.

559
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,072
What about the people?

560
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:14,748
I'm sorry?

561
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,199
The people. The people
down there in that village

562
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:19,655
that don't realize they're gonna be
the special of the day.

563
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:22,170
We've sent G-Team
to begin an evacuation.

564
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:24,985
Dr. Serizawa,
we have a call on the emergency channel

565
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:26,090
from Isla de Mara.

566
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,218
Answer it.

567
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,685
<i>I suppose I should go first.</i>

568
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:39,479
Where's Madison?

569
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:41,487
<i>- She's right here with me.
- Dad, are you okay?</i>

570
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:43,813
Madison, you all right, hon?

571
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:44,903
<i>Dad...</i>

572
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:47,563
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

573
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:49,397
You don't need to be...

574
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,653
<i>It's okay. It's okay.</i>

575
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:51,950
<i>I'm sorry, Dad.</i>

576
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:53,819
She's fine, Mark, trust me.

577
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:56,496
<i>Trust is a little hard
to come by, Dr. Russell.</i>

578
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:58,240
Especially after what you pulled.

579
00:47:58,334 --> 00:47:59,334
<i>I know.</i>

580
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:03,003
And I can only imagine
what you're all thinking.

581
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:07,708
<i>But if there were any other way
to do this, I would.</i>

582
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,421
Do what, Emma?

583
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,261
<i>I'm saving the world.</i>

584
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,598
But by releasing those things?
That doesn't make sense.

585
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:17,391
<i>As impossible as it seems, it does.</i>

586
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:19,970
<i>Hear me out, Mark.</i>

587
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:25,275
<i>After we lost Andrew, I swore his death
would not be in vain.</i>

588
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:29,446
<i>That I would find an answer. A solution
to why the Titans were rising.</i>

589
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:34,823
<i>But as I dug deeper, I realized
that they were here for a reason.</i>

590
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:39,247
<i>And that despite all the years
that we spent trying to stop them,</i>

591
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,416
<i>we never dared to confront the truth.</i>

592
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,460
Which truth?

593
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:47,381
Humans have been the dominant species
for thousands of years,

594
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:48,832
and look what's happened.

595
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:50,838
Overpopulation,

596
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:54,679
<i>pollution, war.</i>

597
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:59,059
<i>The mass extinction we feared
has already begun.</i>

598
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,602
<i>And we are the cause.</i>

599
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,852
<i>We are the infection.</i>

600
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:07,146
<i>But like all living organisms,</i>

601
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:10,525
<i>the Earth unleashed a fever
to fight this infection.</i>

602
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:15,655
<i>Its original and rightful rulers,
the Titans.</i>

603
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:19,704
<i>They are part
of the Earth's natural defense system.</i>

604
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,625
<i>A way to protect the planet,
to maintain its balance.</i>

605
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:28,122
<i>But if governments are allowed
to contain them, destroy them,</i>

606
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,922
<i>or use them for war,</i>

607
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:33,009
<i>the human infection
will only continue to spread.</i>

608
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:38,932
<i>And within our lifetime,
our planet will perish,</i>

609
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,683
<i>and so will we.</i>

610
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,683
Unless we restore balance.

611
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:46,265
<i>And what's gonna be left,
if you do this?</i>

612
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:49,692
<i>A dead, charred world,
overrun by monsters?</i>

613
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:52,896
No, Dr. Stanton, the exact opposite.

614
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,983
<i>Just like how a forest fire
replenishes the soil,</i>

615
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,739
<i>or how a volcano creates new land,</i>

616
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,367
<i>we have seen signs that these creatures
will do the same.</i>

617
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:05,166
<i>San Francisco, Las Vegas,
wherever the Titans go,</i>

618
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:08,787
<i>life follows,
triggered by their radiation.</i>

619
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:12,507
<i>They are the only thing that can reverse
the destruction that we started.</i>

620
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:17,008
<i>They are the only guarantee
that life will carry on.</i>

621
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:20,052
<i>But for that to happen,
we must set them free.</i>

622
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:21,641
You are murdering the world.

623
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:22,638
<i>No.</i>

624
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:28,315
<i>Because as difficult as this will be,
I promise humanity will not go extinct.</i>

625
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:32,186
<i>Using the ORCA,
we will return to a natural order.</i>

626
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:36,944
<i>A forgotten order, where we coexisted
in balance with the Titans.</i>

627
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,862
<i>The first gods.</i>

628
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:41,111
This is a dangerous path.

629
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,948
You are meddling with forces
beyond our comprehension.

630
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,999
Gambling with the lives of billions!

631
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:48,993
<i>And what are you
gambling with, Serizawa?</i>

632
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:50,454
<i>Monarch is broken.</i>

633
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,915
<i>It's on the verge of being shut down
by a government</i>

634
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,421
<i>whose only objective
is to eradicate the creatures.</i>

635
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:58,345
<i>And if that happens,
what will our chances be?</i>

636
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,304
You are out of your goddamn mind!

637
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,152
<i>First, you put
our daughter's life in danger</i>

638
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:04,538
<i>and now you get to decide the fate
of the world. That's rich, Emma!</i>

639
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:08,602
<i>I couldn't be more sane,
and Madison couldn't be stronger.</i>

640
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:11,650
<i>After we lost Andrew,
I trained her to survive.</i>

641
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:14,190
<i>And at least now,
she will have a fighting chance.</i>

642
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,897
A fighting chance?
Why don't you listen to yourself?

643
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:20,616
<i>It's not all math, Emma.
Some things, you can't control.</i>

644
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,304
<i>And there are some things
that you can't run from.</i>

645
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,074
This won't bring him back to us.

646
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:44,182
<i>I can only urge you all to take refuge.</i>

647
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:49,851
<i>Over the last 60 years, Monarch has
prepared bunkers around the world</i>

648
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,932
<i>to save and restart civilization.</i>

649
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:54,355
<i>I suggest you find them.</i>

650
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:02,985
That bitch.

651
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,112
How long until this thing lands?

652
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:06,950
Three minutes.

653
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,560
You might want to rethink that.

654
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:09,584
Why?

655
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:11,584
Something's not right. Check this out.

656
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:16,673
Emma's not at Isla de Mara. I mean,
the signal's too weak to be local.

657
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,541
She's bouncing it off our satellites.

658
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,753
They must be holed up
in one of our old bunkers.

659
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:22,595
She could be anywhere.

660
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,513
What is that?

661
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,268
Oh, Jesus! She shut down
the containment system.

662
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:31,312
How much time do we have?

663
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:34,399
Containment system bypassed.
We're patched in.

664
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,366
- Hmm.
- Ready to broadcast the ORCA.

665
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,612
Doctor?

666
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:54,998
Mom, don't!

667
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,622
I'm sorry, did a child just tell you
what to do?

668
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,548
Maybe Dad is right.
Maybe this isn't the way.

669
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:03,128
By all means, Dr. Russell,
let's reconsider our entire plan.

670
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,346
Especially after telling
your friends about it.

671
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,632
Madison, we talked about this.

672
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:09,287
No, you said you were gonna help people,
that you would let them find shelter...

673
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,769
We don't have time for this!

674
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,722
Did you really think
this was gonna be easy?

675
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:16,274
Painless? Is that what you told her?

676
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:17,922
- Leave her out of this.
- Why?

677
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,860
You're the one who pulled her into it.

678
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:23,531
Madison, tell me, what exactly
did Mommy sell you on?

679
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,199
Some grand utopia?

680
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:28,278
Man and monster,
living together in blissful harmony?

681
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:29,432
Sir,

682
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:30,816
they're attempting to lock us out.

683
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,081
It's now or never.

684
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:36,874
Emma, you came to me. This is your plan.

685
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:40,172
We both want to save the planet,
but everything is going to die

686
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:42,216
if we don't see it through.

687
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:45,795
Please, at least let them get to safety.

688
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:50,638
Ma'am, our window's closing.

689
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:53,807
Mom...

690
00:53:56,984 --> 00:54:00,398
I'm sorry, Madison.
This is bigger than just you and me.

691
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:27,532
Tell them to slow it down.

692
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:29,356
Tell them to stand back!

693
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:39,437
Move! Get out of the way!

694
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,092
Clear, men!

695
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,999
You got a catchy name for this one?

696
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:47,550
Local legends call it

697
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:50,421
Rodan, the fire demon.

698
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:52,388
That's comforting.

699
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,931
Guys?

700
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:56,972
You remember that tropical storm
where we lost Monster Zero?

701
00:55:57,563 --> 00:56:01,147
It's changing direction,
and, uh, guess where it's headed now.

702
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:03,182
That's not possible.

703
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,230
No storm moves that fast.

704
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,186
Unless it's not a storm.

705
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:12,575
- Oh, man!
- We need time to finish the evacuation.

706
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:15,263
Well, then you'd better hurry,
'cause it's closing in fast.

707
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:19,495
Serizawa, it's not a coincidence
that Monster Zero thing is headed here.

708
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:21,201
It's reacting to Big Bird's cries.

709
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:23,373
That means it's coming
for food, a fight, or...

710
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,580
...something more intimate.

711
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:26,957
What do you suggest?

712
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:31,840
<i>All fighters, weapons free.</i>

713
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:56,990
Oh, I think we got his attention.

714
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,533
Everyone, strap in.

715
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:00,707
All ships, follow our lead.

716
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,197
No!

717
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:39,905
Please! Wait!

718
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,747
It's gonna be okay!

719
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:43,283
Hang on, kid!

720
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,920
No! Mama!

721
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:02,636
<i>Argo</i> to Gold Squadron.
Let's lure this turkey away

722
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:04,728
from the mainland
straight to Monster Zero.

723
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:05,959
ETA two minutes!

724
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:07,690
Gold Squadron, engage on our six.

725
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:09,233
<i>Copy. Start the clock.</i>

726
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:29,378
<i>Bogey. Nine o'clock high!</i>

727
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:37,963
Duster 223.

728
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:40,218
<i>Get out of there. He's on your tail.
Get out of there!</i>

729
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:50,767
Cobra's Raptor is off the team!

730
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:53,144
ETA to Monster Zero, 60 seconds!

731
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:56,657
<i>Raptor 37.</i>

732
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,191
<i>Bogey coming up on your six.</i>

733
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:13,672
<i>I'm losing control here.
I'm losing control!</i>

734
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,257
We lost the squadron!

735
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:21,839
ETA to Monster Zero, 30 seconds!

736
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:40,658
Ten seconds!

737
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:04,466
Dive! Dive!

738
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,411
Jesus, they're killing each other.

739
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:32,021
<i>Mayday, mayday!
This is Raptor One to</i> Argo.

740
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,252
Argo, <i>do you read?</i>

741
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:35,138
<i>Copy, Raptor One.
What's your status?</i>

742
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:37,916
We're screwed, that's what.
And we got kids on board.

743
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:40,046
We're gonna need
immediate mid-air retrieval.

744
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:42,824
Lock on to their position, and prepare
the hangar for an emergency landing.

745
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:45,431
- Hangar doors are unresponsive.
- Manual override?

746
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:46,640
They're stuck!

747
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,805
- All right, which way to the hangar?
- I can show you.

748
01:00:50,856 --> 01:00:51,892
Anybody else?

749
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:55,103
I know the way. Come on.

750
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:56,442
Hope you got a big wrench.

751
01:01:05,954 --> 01:01:09,163
- What's the problem?
- Hydraulics systems are jammed!

752
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:12,034
I'm trying to jump-start power.
It's not looking good.

753
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,839
It's Admiral Stenz.

754
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:25,759
- Admiral.
<i>- Dr. Serizawa,</i>

755
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:29,308
<i>Colonel Foster. I need you
and your forces to immediately disengage</i>

756
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:30,851
<i>and withdraw to a safe distance.</i>

757
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:32,762
Admiral, I don't understand.

758
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:38,693
<i>We have been developing a prototype
for a new weapon. An oxygen destroyer.</i>

759
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:43,239
<i>Designed to exterminate all life forms
within a two-mile radius.</i>

760
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:46,985
<i>With any luck, it will kill these things
and this nightmare will finally be over.</i>

761
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:49,536
Admiral, we must keep
our faith in <i>Gojira.</i>

762
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:53,583
<i>I'm sorry, Doctor. You had your chance.
The missile is already on its way.</i>

763
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:55,660
<i>May God have mercy on us all.</i>

764
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:01,875
He's not lying.
It's coming in hot.

765
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:05,674
Argo, <i>you gotta get
those bay doors open now!</i>

766
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:06,908
Have the crash and fire crews ready.

767
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:15,221
What the hell do you think you're doing?

768
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,522
Look out!

769
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:26,408
Hold on!

770
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:30,449
Come on, Griff! Come on!

771
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:33,782
Hit it! Hit it!

772
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:52,133
That's what
I'm talking about, Griff!

773
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:53,684
Everybody okay?

774
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:56,707
Get over
to the back of the hangar.

775
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:58,376
We're all gonna head this way.
This way. This way.

776
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,400
Thanks for the lift!

777
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,445
Go! Go!

778
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:06,735
Oh, God!

779
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:33,536
We're getting out of here.

780
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,176
The military launched a weapon.

781
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:36,393
It's gonna kill 'em both.

782
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,141
Well, that's not the worst idea.

783
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:47,734
Ten...

784
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:48,824
nine...

785
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:51,201
eight...

786
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:52,953
seven...

787
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:06,582
Three, two...

788
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:53,345
Jesus.

789
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,974
Dr. Stanton, can you locate <i>Gojira?</i>

790
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:01,767
Yeah. I got something.

791
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:08,565
His vitals are fading.
Radiation levels plummeting.

792
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:12,485
Come on, big guy. Fight it.

793
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:24,086
He's gone.

794
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:30,499
Looks like you got your wish, Mark.

795
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:57,799
I thought we were going
to release them gradually.

796
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:00,051
One at a time.

797
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:03,266
I'm not the one doing this.

798
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,691
Long live the king.

799
01:07:23,248 --> 01:07:24,784
You're a monster.

800
01:07:36,928 --> 01:07:38,906
<i>Castle Bravo,
this is Containment Team Mosura.</i>

801
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:40,262
<i>Do you read? Over.</i>

802
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:43,327
- Castle Bravo, this is Containment Team.
- Anything?

803
01:07:43,351 --> 01:07:44,262
Dr. Brooks.

804
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:46,184
We've lost contact with the <i>Argo,</i>

805
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:48,103
Castle Bravo
and the other containment sites.

806
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:51,353
Angkor Wat, Skull Island,
Stone Mountain.

807
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:54,185
All the Titans, they're escaping.

808
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,240
<i>Repeat, this may be our last comm.</i>

809
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:00,232
Wait, wait, wait.

810
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:01,533
It's him.

811
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,327
He's the one doing this.

812
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:06,155
They're responding to his call.

813
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:10,033
Oh, God!
Where's Dr. Ling?

814
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:12,749
She's outside.

815
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:17,834
Dr. Ling!
We've lost contact with Monarch.

816
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:21,386
Dr. Ling?

817
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:34,396
- Madison, wait!
- Get away from me!

818
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:38,255
Look, I know things haven't gone exactly
according to plan, but I can fix this.

819
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:40,966
According to plan?
You said that you were gonna be careful.

820
01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:43,572
That you'd release them one at a time,
that you would restore balance!

821
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,658
They were gonna take over Monarch
and kill the Titans.

822
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:46,682
I didn't have a choice.

823
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:48,223
Bullshit!

824
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:55,014
You said we were doing this for Andrew.

825
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:01,896
Do you really think
he would've wanted this?

826
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:11,283
Exactly.

827
01:10:15,837 --> 01:10:16,873
Madison!

828
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:21,131
Madison!

829
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:35,558
Any luck?

830
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:37,765
No.

831
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:42,691
Whatever Emma used to create
the ORCA signal, I've never heard it.

832
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:44,522
How are you doing?

833
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:47,576
How's that?

834
01:10:47,702 --> 01:10:49,068
"Myth is our compass."

835
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:52,454
It's something my mom used to say.

836
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:55,704
She believed our stories
about monsters and dragons

837
01:10:55,793 --> 01:11:00,003
could help us find the Titans
and restore our connection to nature.

838
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:02,877
Wait, your mother?
You're second-generation Monarch?

839
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:04,125
Third.

840
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:06,548
It runs in the family.

841
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:08,470
That's incredible.

842
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:11,276
I don't suppose your family has any tips
on slaying dragons, do they?

843
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:14,180
Slaying dragons is a Western concept.

844
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,182
In the East, they are sacred.

845
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:19,936
Divine creatures who brought
wisdom, strength...

846
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,442
even redemption.

847
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:28,194
This oxygen destroyer,
why wasn't Monster Zero affected?

848
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:30,429
I mean, I'm no scientist,
but I think it has something to do

849
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:32,160
with his goddamn head growing back.

850
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:33,862
Well, I've never seen anything like it.

851
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:36,664
It violates everything we know
about the natural order.

852
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:39,456
Unless he's not part
of the natural order.

853
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:40,376
What do you mean?

854
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:42,713
I was able to piece this together.

855
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:47,635
Well, he looks vaguely familiar.

856
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,383
It tells of a great dragon
who fell from the stars.

857
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:55,308
A Hydra whose storm swallowed
both men and gods alike.

858
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:56,517
What, you mean an alien?

859
01:11:56,604 --> 01:11:59,472
Yes.
He's not part of our natural order.

860
01:11:59,607 --> 01:12:01,314
And he's not meant to be here.

861
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:03,183
A false king.

862
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:04,435
An invasive species.

863
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:07,438
That could explain how he's creating
these massive storms

864
01:12:07,532 --> 01:12:09,649
and the effect he's having
on the other Titans.

865
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:12,906
It's almost like he's reshaping
the planet to his own liking.

866
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:14,699
These legends, what did they call him?

867
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:18,115
Ghidorah. "The one who is many."

868
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:20,966
- Ghi-what?
- She's saying it's like gonorrhea.

869
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:22,995
- Huh?
- Ghidorah!

870
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:25,547
Dr. Serizawa,
we're approaching Castle Bravo...

871
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:27,670
but there's something you should see.

872
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:34,093
I'm guessing
you weren't expecting these guys.

873
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:39,803
Moscow, London, Washington, D.C.,

874
01:12:40,398 --> 01:12:41,809
all under attack.

875
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:44,566
On every continent,
the Titans are triggering

876
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:47,645
earthquakes, wildfires, tsunamis

877
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:50,230
and disasters we don't even
have names for yet.

878
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:53,032
Now as before, we have been trying

879
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:55,076
to lure the creatures
with nuclear materials,

880
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:57,074
but they are not taking
the bait this time.

881
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,491
Their behavior has become random.

882
01:13:00,585 --> 01:13:01,416
Erratic.

883
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:04,503
And with our forces
spread desperately thin

884
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:07,582
and these things
roaming the globe unimpeded

885
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:09,211
we are running out of options...

886
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:11,088
and time.

887
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,132
Excuse me, do you have something to add?

888
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:15,763
Yeah. You're wrong.

889
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:19,309
Their behavior is not random or erratic.

890
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:20,437
If I may, sir.

891
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:23,059
As amazing as this sounds,

892
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:25,682
they're moving like a pack.
They're hunting.

893
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:28,940
All packs, from wolves to killer whales,

894
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:31,488
they all respond directly to an alpha.

895
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:33,152
And this Ghidorah is the new alpha.

896
01:13:33,284 --> 01:13:35,697
And all the other creatures
are just doing his bidding.

897
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:37,448
They're an extension of him.

898
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:41,740
We stop him, we stop them all.

899
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:44,664
Is there another creature
that might stand a chance against him?

900
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:45,754
No.

901
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:49,461
Ghidorah and <i>Gojira's</i> rivalry
was ancient and unique.

902
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:53,294
Right, so we killed our best shot
at beating this thing?

903
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:56,760
<i>Jonah, you don't get it.
This changes everything.</i>

904
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:59,262
<i>With Godzilla gone,
Monster Zero isn't using the Titans</i>

905
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:01,225
to restore the planet.

906
01:14:01,312 --> 01:14:03,429
He is using them to destroy it.

907
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:06,356
This isn't coexistence.
This is extinction.

908
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:08,396
Listen, while you
were sitting comfortably

909
01:14:08,486 --> 01:14:09,727
in some laboratory,

910
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:13,981
we've been fighting for decades
in one dirty war after another.

911
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:16,237
I've seen human nature firsthand,

912
01:14:16,327 --> 01:14:18,535
and I'm here to tell you
that it doesn't get any better.

913
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:19,953
It just gets worse.

914
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:24,575
So, I'm sorry that Monster Zero
isn't exactly what we were expecting.

915
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:30,084
But we opened Pandora's Box
and there's no closing it now.

916
01:14:33,052 --> 01:14:35,419
- Maybe there is.
- Oh, don't be stupid.

917
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:39,302
You broadcast again,
and you will expose us all.

918
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:41,759
These creatures communicate
like whales, okay?

919
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:44,094
<i>They can hear sonar
for thousands of miles,</i>

920
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:46,604
<i>so let's send a team.</i>

921
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:48,683
<i>Let's broadcast the ORCA from Fenway.</i>

922
01:14:48,776 --> 01:14:50,312
<i>It's just a few miles from here.</i>

923
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:54,779
I could use the stadium to amplify
a signal that might stop these attacks.

924
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:57,524
<i>The city's already being evacuated,
so it'll be safe.</i>

925
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:58,660
<i>And then what?</i>

926
01:14:58,703 --> 01:14:59,944
<i>And then I'll figure out</i>

927
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:02,654
<i>what the hell Monster Zero
really is and try to stop it.</i>

928
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,205
<i>Before Monarch finds us?</i>

929
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:07,076
<i>I'm sure all your friends will be
very happy to see you again.</i>

930
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:09,085
<i>We can'tjust sit here.</i>

931
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:11,053
<i>All right?
This isn't the world that we wanted.</i>

932
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:12,839
<i>I seem to remember
you telling me</i>

933
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:15,838
<i>that the world always belonged to them.</i>

934
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:19,008
<i>Well, maybe it is time we give it back.</i>

935
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:23,596
Mark!

936
01:15:24,645 --> 01:15:26,181
Mark, wait.
What are you doing?

937
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:29,351
I can't just sit down there.
I gotta do something.

938
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:30,769
Like what?

939
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:32,688
- Like go find my daughter.
- How?

940
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:34,103
Where are you gonna go?

941
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:38,399
She's the only thing I got left, Sam.

942
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:42,072
I wasn't there for her.

943
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:43,745
I'm not gonna let that happen again.

944
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,369
Good luck.

945
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:00,773
Beautiful.

946
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:03,400
Mothra.

947
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:05,485
Queen of the Monsters.

948
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:09,038
Are you recording this, Stanton?

949
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:13,243
I record everything now.

950
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:15,457
Everything.

951
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:19,423
It's like a song.

952
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:22,799
I bet there's only one thing
that can understand this.

953
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:26,090
Godzilla.

954
01:17:31,689 --> 01:17:34,432
Yeah, I got it.
Picking up a reply. Bringing it up.

955
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:41,855
He's still alive.

956
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:47,327
So, her and Godzilla...

957
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:49,579
They got a thing going on?

958
01:17:49,707 --> 01:17:51,073
That's kind of messed up, right?

959
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:54,160
Symbiotic relationships
between two different species

960
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:56,628
aren't all that uncommon.

961
01:17:57,214 --> 01:17:58,580
Can you track him?

962
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:00,882
No. Signal's too weak.

963
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:04,594
But maybe she can.

964
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:10,683
How many nukes do you have?

965
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:12,886
Why?

966
01:18:13,564 --> 01:18:15,055
We could help him.

967
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:25,608
This category six hurricane over D.C.
is where King Ghidorah is nesting.

968
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:27,613
Working with all four branches
of the military,

969
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,160
this will be a joint operation

970
01:18:29,288 --> 01:18:31,655
to lure it away from the mainland,

971
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:34,248
<i>so that we can continue evacuations
long enough</i>

972
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:36,868
<i>for our submersible team
to complete its mission.</i>

973
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:45,086
So this plan is what you would call
a "long shot," right?

974
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:48,033
What do those nerds think they're gonna
do down there with a bunch of nukes?

975
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:49,639
You ain't hear 'em, Griffin?

976
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:51,762
They wanna bring Godzilla
back from the dead.

977
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:01,296
<i>We'll be out of range
while you're down there,</i>

978
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,733
<i>but a squadron will stay behind
to keep an eye out for you.</i>

979
01:19:03,864 --> 01:19:06,064
<i>- Appreciate it.
- All righty, Bowman,</i>

980
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:07,740
let's take her down.

981
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:10,409
Dive the ship.
Make depth 150.

982
01:19:10,537 --> 01:19:11,744
<i>Good luck.</i>

983
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:14,455
<i>Thanks, Sam. We'll need it.</i>

984
01:19:40,693 --> 01:19:42,059
What time is it?

985
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:46,396
Time to get a new watch.

986
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:50,278
Andrew's favorite joke.

987
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:55,539
You never took that watch out of your
pocket without him asking that question.

988
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:01,123
You told me five years ago,

989
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:05,457
I'd be trying to save the thing
that took my son,

990
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:09,279
that would be the only way
to save the family I have left, I'd...

991
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:10,841
Sometimes...

992
01:20:11,682 --> 01:20:14,766
the only way to heal our wounds
is to make peace

993
01:20:14,852 --> 01:20:17,185
with the demons who created them.

994
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:19,353
You really believe that?

995
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:20,851
Don't you?

996
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:23,225
Isn't that why you are here?

997
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:29,780
There are some things
beyond our understanding, Mark.

998
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:34,111
We must accept them and learn from them

999
01:20:35,122 --> 01:20:38,991
because these moments of crisis
are also potential moments of faith.

1000
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:42,039
A time

1001
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:45,335
when we either come together
or fall apart.

1002
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:50,214
Nature always has a way
of balancing itself.

1003
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:53,800
The only question is...

1004
01:20:56,143 --> 01:20:59,011
what part will we play?

1005
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:02,601
Did you just make that up?

1006
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:03,522
No.

1007
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:05,892
I read it in a fortune cookie once.

1008
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:10,404
A really long fortune cookie.

1009
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:18,016
- Status of the ship?
- Some sort of vortex, Captain.

1010
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:20,532
It's dragging us.
1,600 feet till impact.

1011
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:27,873
800 feet.

1012
01:21:28,008 --> 01:21:29,374
Emergency blow! 200 feet!

1013
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:30,546
One hundred!

1014
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:32,843
Twenty-five!

1015
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:34,421
Brace for impact!

1016
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,488
Argo, <i>this is</i> USS Brody

1017
01:22:55,512 --> 01:22:57,504
<i>en route to evacuation perimeter.</i>

1018
01:22:57,598 --> 01:23:00,511
<i>Weapons hot.
Ready to engage Titans on your command.</i>

1019
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:04,055
Jesus.

1020
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:06,308
It's like the whole sky's alive.

1021
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:09,474
That's because it is.

1022
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:13,404
Here we go.

1023
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:19,158
Status report.

1024
01:23:19,286 --> 01:23:20,993
Can't fix our position. GPS is down.

1025
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:23,196
But inertial says we're

1026
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:24,531
600 miles from departure.

1027
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:25,911
That can't be.

1028
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:27,412
I knew it, man!

1029
01:23:27,544 --> 01:23:30,753
The vortex was a tunnel
into the Hollow Earth.

1030
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:34,674
It's a subterranean tunnel system
that connects the entire planet.

1031
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,968
It doesn't matter. I knew I was right.
I told you, Chen!

1032
01:23:37,054 --> 01:23:38,054
Shut up, Rick.

1033
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:40,588
One second emergency blow forward.

1034
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:51,603
Doctor?

1035
01:23:52,402 --> 01:23:54,109
Launch probes.

1036
01:24:07,668 --> 01:24:09,830
Range 1,000 meters.

1037
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:12,245
Camera good.

1038
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:17,046
Holding range. Steady.

1039
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:22,547
Jesus.

1040
01:24:22,683 --> 01:24:24,174
Pan right.

1041
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:50,415
Looks Egyptian.

1042
01:24:50,544 --> 01:24:53,412
- Or Roman.
- No, this is something different.

1043
01:24:53,547 --> 01:24:55,914
This is way older.

1044
01:25:05,892 --> 01:25:07,133
Oh, my.

1045
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:18,899
All of the legends...

1046
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:21,189
the stories...

1047
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:22,948
they are true.

1048
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:25,193
They really were the first gods.

1049
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:27,167
If only the earth and stones
could speak,

1050
01:25:27,205 --> 01:25:29,288
the stories they could tell us.

1051
01:25:29,374 --> 01:25:30,374
Dr. Stanton,

1052
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:32,250
any sign of <i>Gojira?</i>

1053
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:36,292
Yeah, the probe is picking up
a radioactive blob

1054
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:38,122
just past that ridge.

1055
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:40,420
Set a course.

1056
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:50,117
<i>Attention, please.</i>

1057
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:53,934
<i>Martial law has now been instated
by order of the President.</i>

1058
01:25:54,024 --> 01:25:57,563
<i>The greater Boston area is now
under control of the US Military.</i>

1059
01:25:58,070 --> 01:26:01,154
<i>All citizens to report to the nearest
evacuation center</i>

1060
01:26:01,239 --> 01:26:02,400
<i>for immediate transport.</i>

1061
01:26:02,991 --> 01:26:07,110
<i>I repeat, all citizens are to report
to the nearest evacuation...</i>

1062
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:10,205
<i>Massive storms and
other disasters triggered by the Titans</i>

1063
01:26:10,248 --> 01:26:12,615
<i>have forced millions
to flee major cities.</i>

1064
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:15,793
<i>And with D. C. hit hard
by a category six hurricane</i>

1065
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:18,254
<i>that has left the capital
completely flooded,</i>

1066
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:22,254
<i>this is the single greatest disaster
in human history.</i>

1067
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:25,800
<i>The grim search continues,
as people around the world</i>

1068
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:27,531
<i>sift through the debris of leveled homes</i>

1069
01:26:27,641 --> 01:26:29,598
<i>in the hope of finding
missing loved ones.</i>

1070
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:33,645
<i>And though this sight is heartbreaking,
it is unfortunately nothing unique.</i>

1071
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:35,847
<i>Cities around the globe have fallen</i>

1072
01:26:35,982 --> 01:26:37,542
<i>under the wake of what many are calling</i>

1073
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:39,771
<i>"The Rise of the Titans."</i>

1074
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:47,362
I think we should stop.

1075
01:26:47,494 --> 01:26:48,494
Why?

1076
01:26:48,578 --> 01:26:50,911
'Cause I still wanna have kids
one day.

1077
01:26:50,997 --> 01:26:53,205
Preferably without flippers.

1078
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:54,581
All stop.

1079
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:55,746
Hover the ship.

1080
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:06,301
Whoa.

1081
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:10,260
We got O2, CO2, and methane.

1082
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:12,637
It looks like there's
some sort of air pocket in there.

1083
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:27,861
- My God.
- Zilla.

1084
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:31,528
- And good night, Gracie.
- Pull up the last frame.

1085
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:33,199
- Yup.
- There.

1086
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:34,872
The source of the radiation.

1087
01:27:34,958 --> 01:27:36,665
That's why he returned here.

1088
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:38,785
He's feeding...

1089
01:27:38,879 --> 01:27:40,495
regenerating.

1090
01:27:41,465 --> 01:27:43,206
This is his home.

1091
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:47,343
This is how he's survived for so long.

1092
01:27:47,471 --> 01:27:50,339
Always adapting, evolving.

1093
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:52,761
- It's incredible.
- So...

1094
01:27:52,893 --> 01:27:54,555
dude's got this covered.

1095
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:56,473
Right? He just needs a little nap.

1096
01:27:56,563 --> 01:27:57,394
No.

1097
01:27:57,522 --> 01:27:59,388
This process could take years.

1098
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:00,935
We have to proceed as planned.

1099
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:02,308
Hang on.

1100
01:28:02,402 --> 01:28:07,193
We're gonna launch a nuclear torpedo
in order to revive a giant monster.

1101
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:10,571
Okay, this is not like
we're just jump-starting a car.

1102
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:12,138
We have another complication.

1103
01:28:12,162 --> 01:28:15,030
Our weapons systems were damaged
during the crash.

1104
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:17,285
- We can't launch.
- Can it be repaired?

1105
01:28:17,918 --> 01:28:18,918
I'm afraid not.

1106
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:22,958
Okay.
What if we go inside, set a timer,

1107
01:28:23,089 --> 01:28:24,580
and blow up the warhead manually?

1108
01:28:24,674 --> 01:28:28,338
No way. If the heat doesn't fry you,
the radiation will.

1109
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:32,890
I'll go.

1110
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:34,723
What the hell does that mean?

1111
01:28:35,352 --> 01:28:37,890
- There must be another way.
- There's no time for debate.

1112
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:40,764
I'll go.

1113
01:28:59,292 --> 01:29:00,999
<i>Argo,</i> we are red on ammo

1114
01:29:01,127 --> 01:29:03,047
<i>and low on fuel.
We can't take much more of this!</i>

1115
01:29:03,129 --> 01:29:05,416
Copy, copy.
Just hold them off as long as you can.

1116
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:07,902
Colonel, take a look at this.
All the Titans have stopped.

1117
01:29:13,390 --> 01:29:15,427
What the hell has gotten into them now?

1118
01:29:21,898 --> 01:29:23,376
<i>It does appear as if</i>

1119
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,392
<i>the attacks have ceased
for the time being</i>

1120
01:29:25,527 --> 01:29:28,361
<i>with the creatures going
from destructive to docile</i>

1121
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:29,695
<i>within minutes.</i>

1122
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:31,989
<i>Now, no one is sure how or why,</i>

1123
01:29:32,117 --> 01:29:35,827
<i>but this seems to be happening
simultaneously around the world.</i>

1124
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:39,534
What's going on?

1125
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:41,457
The ORCA.

1126
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:43,377
What?

1127
01:29:44,504 --> 01:29:46,416
I wonder who could have done this.

1128
01:29:51,595 --> 01:29:52,756
Maddie?

1129
01:30:00,937 --> 01:30:02,428
Maddie.

1130
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:10,521
First contact, you're gonna
start losing your long-range vision.

1131
01:30:10,614 --> 01:30:11,980
When you surface,

1132
01:30:12,115 --> 01:30:13,342
your motor skills
are gonna start to fade,

1133
01:30:13,366 --> 01:30:15,858
but I put a helioxed mixture in the tank

1134
01:30:15,952 --> 01:30:19,286
which should help you
stay stable a little longer.

1135
01:30:20,874 --> 01:30:22,991
It was an honor, man.

1136
01:30:38,058 --> 01:30:39,058
Thank you.

1137
01:30:44,064 --> 01:30:45,475
My notes.

1138
01:30:48,193 --> 01:30:49,775
Are you sure?

1139
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:54,614
He fought for us, died for us.

1140
01:30:54,699 --> 01:30:57,863
He's not only proof
that coexistence is possible...

1141
01:31:00,246 --> 01:31:03,114
he is the key to it.

1142
01:31:06,419 --> 01:31:08,957
Take care of them, Mark.

1143
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:14,519
Bowman, take us out, fast.

1144
01:32:14,612 --> 01:32:16,148
Aye, Captain.

1145
01:32:18,992 --> 01:32:20,672
He's clear.

1146
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:15,157
You all right?

1147
01:35:15,251 --> 01:35:18,244
Bowman, send a distress message
to the <i>Argo.</i>

1148
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:20,086
Aye, Captain.

1149
01:35:37,690 --> 01:35:39,647
See anything?

1150
01:36:46,968 --> 01:36:48,800
Nobody move!

1151
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:27,126
Are you okay?

1152
01:37:28,009 --> 01:37:30,422
I know how to find 'em.

1153
01:37:35,016 --> 01:37:36,632
I know how to find 'em!

1154
01:37:38,436 --> 01:37:40,553
Let's make him proud
and not screw this up.

1155
01:37:42,815 --> 01:37:44,647
- How did he, uh...
- By saving us.

1156
01:37:48,446 --> 01:37:49,982
Sam, what've we got going on?

1157
01:37:50,073 --> 01:37:52,736
We think Emma activated the ORCA
somewhere near Boston.

1158
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:55,359
That's why Ghidorah and Godzilla
are both headed that way now.

1159
01:37:55,495 --> 01:37:57,987
But we haven't been able to pinpoint
the exact location

1160
01:37:58,081 --> 01:37:59,947
without the missing piece
of the ORCA signal.

1161
01:38:00,041 --> 01:38:01,121
I've got the missing piece.

1162
01:38:01,793 --> 01:38:03,854
It's Godzilla, right?

1163
01:38:03,878 --> 01:38:05,718
- I know we already tried.
- It's not Godzilla.

1164
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:08,543
- It's us.
- What do you mean "us"?

1165
01:38:08,633 --> 01:38:11,341
Emma combined the bioacoustics
of Godzilla with a human.

1166
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:13,210
That's how she made
the signal for the ORCA.

1167
01:38:13,304 --> 01:38:15,344
The creatures just think
it's another apex predator.

1168
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:16,296
Well, that makes sense.

1169
01:38:16,432 --> 01:38:18,594
I mean, we are a bunch of
horny murderous carnivores.

1170
01:38:18,684 --> 01:38:20,095
Yeah, that's real poetic. Now what?

1171
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:23,182
We track it, we find it,
and we get my daughter back.

1172
01:38:23,272 --> 01:38:25,889
What about Moe, Larry,
and Curly over here?

1173
01:38:25,983 --> 01:38:27,975
Godzilla will bring balance.

1174
01:38:28,069 --> 01:38:32,439
Oh, I get it.
A little Serizawa let-'em-fight action.

1175
01:38:32,532 --> 01:38:33,972
I used to love it when he said that.

1176
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:36,612
No. This time, we join the fight.

1177
01:38:41,249 --> 01:38:42,581
What do you think you're doing?

1178
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:44,228
I don't have time
to argue about this, Jonah.

1179
01:38:44,252 --> 01:38:46,539
- I'm getting Maddie back.
- Not with my men, you're not.

1180
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:50,293
Emma, you said this was about
the greater good.

1181
01:38:50,383 --> 01:38:52,841
That the planet deserved a clean slate.

1182
01:38:52,927 --> 01:38:53,758
But now you're prepared

1183
01:38:53,845 --> 01:38:56,633
to put all our lives in danger
because your little girl is missing.

1184
01:38:56,764 --> 01:38:59,097
- The ORCA is with...
- The ORCA no longer matters.

1185
01:38:59,225 --> 01:39:01,933
Man does not control the laws of nature.

1186
01:39:03,396 --> 01:39:04,853
And neither do you.

1187
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:18,654
I already lost one child...
I'm not losing another.

1188
01:39:20,246 --> 01:39:21,362
I have to fix this.

1189
01:39:23,124 --> 01:39:24,160
Let her go.

1190
01:39:26,294 --> 01:39:28,206
We have everything we need.

1191
01:41:30,126 --> 01:41:31,537
Oh, shit!

1192
01:43:01,175 --> 01:43:03,883
Okay, we've zeroed in
on the last ping from the ORCA.

1193
01:43:04,011 --> 01:43:05,172
Fenway Park, dead ahead.

1194
01:43:05,304 --> 01:43:07,671
<i>We'll lay cover fire
to keep Ghidorah distracted.</i>

1195
01:43:07,765 --> 01:43:08,881
Copy that.

1196
01:43:11,185 --> 01:43:12,926
Colonel, all squadrons
are locked on target.

1197
01:43:14,188 --> 01:43:16,145
For Serizawa.

1198
01:43:50,558 --> 01:43:52,845
Is it just me
or has he been working out?

1199
01:43:52,977 --> 01:43:54,434
Are you kidding me?

1200
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:57,809
- Serizawa's got that lizard juiced!
- Damn right.

1201
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:03,064
Oh, boy. Godzilla's radiation levels
are going through the roof.

1202
01:44:03,195 --> 01:44:05,938
We got about 12 minutes
before he goes thermonuclear.

1203
01:44:06,073 --> 01:44:07,313
What do you mean?

1204
01:44:08,617 --> 01:44:10,199
I'm sayin' in about 12 minutes

1205
01:44:10,327 --> 01:44:12,740
it's gonna be a bad day
to be a Red Sox fan.

1206
01:44:14,123 --> 01:44:15,955
Okay, guys,
you need to find the ORCA,

1207
01:44:16,083 --> 01:44:17,763
get Madison,
and get the hell out of there.

1208
01:44:17,877 --> 01:44:20,665
<i>Whatever Serizawa did to Godzilla
worked a little too well.</i>

1209
01:44:20,796 --> 01:44:23,504
<i>'Cause he's about to explode
like an atom bomb.</i>

1210
01:44:23,591 --> 01:44:25,378
Roger that. Prepare for landing.

1211
01:44:46,822 --> 01:44:47,983
Go, go, go!

1212
01:44:49,033 --> 01:44:49,898
Spread out!

1213
01:44:49,992 --> 01:44:51,324
Flank left!

1214
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:52,410
On me!

1215
01:44:52,536 --> 01:44:53,572
Eyes up!

1216
01:44:54,747 --> 01:44:56,534
You two, over there!

1217
01:45:02,546 --> 01:45:04,788
Madison!

1218
01:45:06,967 --> 01:45:09,209
I got something! Over here.

1219
01:45:10,346 --> 01:45:11,507
Come check this out!

1220
01:45:14,225 --> 01:45:15,386
Are you all right?

1221
01:45:16,519 --> 01:45:19,307
I found the ORCA, sir,
it looks pretty banged up!

1222
01:45:19,939 --> 01:45:21,180
No sign of your daughter.

1223
01:45:28,072 --> 01:45:29,404
She's not here!

1224
01:45:29,490 --> 01:45:30,606
We gotta get out of here!

1225
01:45:30,699 --> 01:45:31,699
Let's go!

1226
01:46:47,318 --> 01:46:48,318
Get in!

1227
01:46:50,946 --> 01:46:52,312
Incoming!

1228
01:46:55,034 --> 01:46:57,367
- Get in!
- Griffin, you all right?

1229
01:46:58,370 --> 01:47:00,828
Martinez, let's get her up.

1230
01:47:08,631 --> 01:47:10,951
- Where's Madison?
- I don't know. I thought she was there!

1231
01:47:11,008 --> 01:47:12,008
Well, she's not there!

1232
01:47:14,803 --> 01:47:15,634
Take it easy!

1233
01:47:15,763 --> 01:47:17,755
- Get that side.
- Okay, okay.

1234
01:47:20,351 --> 01:47:21,471
Look out!

1235
01:47:23,479 --> 01:47:25,812
I hope you're as good at finding her
as you are losing her.

1236
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:27,681
I didn't lose her, she ran away.

1237
01:47:27,816 --> 01:47:29,933
- Well, gee, I wonder why!
- I can't blame that kid.

1238
01:47:30,069 --> 01:47:33,028
If I had these two for parents,
I'd have run away from home, too.

1239
01:47:36,742 --> 01:47:37,573
What did you just say?

1240
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:41,404
"If I had the two of you for parents,
I'd run away from home, too."

1241
01:47:42,831 --> 01:47:43,831
Home.

1242
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:59,239
Godzilla's radiation's
reaching critical mass.

1243
01:48:59,366 --> 01:49:01,153
Six minutes until he blows.

1244
01:49:01,285 --> 01:49:02,901
Order all remaining craft to retreat!

1245
01:50:14,441 --> 01:50:16,979
Maddie!

1246
01:50:17,069 --> 01:50:18,185
Madison!

1247
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:19,982
Maddie!

1248
01:50:20,572 --> 01:50:22,029
Madison!

1249
01:50:22,741 --> 01:50:23,948
Madison!

1250
01:50:24,743 --> 01:50:26,609
Madison!

1251
01:50:30,582 --> 01:50:31,582
Emma!

1252
01:50:33,168 --> 01:50:33,999
Maddie!

1253
01:50:34,086 --> 01:50:35,086
Martinez!

1254
01:50:35,754 --> 01:50:36,995
We got it. On three.

1255
01:50:37,131 --> 01:50:38,667
One, two, three...

1256
01:50:41,135 --> 01:50:42,467
Lift together.

1257
01:50:57,651 --> 01:50:59,313
Oh, my baby.

1258
01:51:00,737 --> 01:51:03,320
Is she breathing?
Mark, is she breathing?

1259
01:51:03,407 --> 01:51:04,407
Maddie.

1260
01:51:09,204 --> 01:51:11,287
Maddie.

1261
01:51:13,375 --> 01:51:14,456
Maddie.

1262
01:51:14,543 --> 01:51:15,875
Mom.

1263
01:51:15,961 --> 01:51:17,202
- Dad.
- Shh.

1264
01:51:18,422 --> 01:51:20,129
- Mom.
- We're here.

1265
01:53:12,244 --> 01:53:13,451
Roger that.

1266
01:53:13,537 --> 01:53:15,403
Osprey's coming in two minutes.

1267
01:53:15,497 --> 01:53:18,490
- We gotta work fast.
- To do what?

1268
01:53:21,628 --> 01:53:22,664
You sure about this?

1269
01:53:22,796 --> 01:53:24,332
It's the only way to save him.

1270
01:53:24,464 --> 01:53:27,832
We fix it, get on the osprey
and draw that thing away from Godzilla.

1271
01:53:27,968 --> 01:53:29,755
Buy him time to get back on his feet.

1272
01:53:41,273 --> 01:53:42,500
Mark, you've seen
what that thing can do.

1273
01:53:42,524 --> 01:53:45,062
I know. It'll be tight,
but we have to take that chance.

1274
01:53:52,701 --> 01:53:53,701
Are you good to go?

1275
01:53:53,785 --> 01:53:56,528
- Yes.
- All right. One, two...

1276
01:53:56,663 --> 01:53:57,663
three.

1277
01:54:01,710 --> 01:54:04,043
That's it. That's it!

1278
01:54:10,052 --> 01:54:11,418
Come on, Griff. We got you.

1279
01:54:14,348 --> 01:54:15,634
Come on, Emma. Let's go.

1280
01:54:15,724 --> 01:54:18,888
Okay. Take her. Take her!
I still have to activate it.

1281
01:54:18,977 --> 01:54:20,934
- What?
- I'm right behind you. Go!

1282
01:54:33,950 --> 01:54:35,070
Let's go, let's go!

1283
01:54:35,702 --> 01:54:36,702
Mom!

1284
01:54:38,038 --> 01:54:38,869
Mom!

1285
01:54:38,997 --> 01:54:40,488
Come on, Maddie!

1286
01:54:40,582 --> 01:54:42,323
Go, go, go!

1287
01:54:45,962 --> 01:54:48,045
You got any pain anywhere
besides your leg?

1288
01:54:55,180 --> 01:54:57,513
- We gotta lift off, now!
- Wait!

1289
01:55:07,526 --> 01:55:09,188
Emma, let's go! Come on!

1290
01:55:09,319 --> 01:55:11,106
Mom!

1291
01:55:19,371 --> 01:55:20,532
Mom.

1292
01:55:21,164 --> 01:55:22,996
I love you.

1293
01:55:23,125 --> 01:55:24,912
No.

1294
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:28,002
- No!
- Emma!

1295
01:55:28,130 --> 01:55:30,372
Mom!

1296
01:56:07,085 --> 01:56:08,085
No.

1297
01:56:10,172 --> 01:56:11,172
No.

1298
01:56:28,899 --> 01:56:31,232
Mom!

1299
01:56:57,552 --> 01:57:00,716
Long live... the king.

1300
01:59:19,069 --> 01:59:20,435
Jesus.

1301
01:59:21,571 --> 01:59:23,403
Good thing he's on our side.

1302
01:59:23,990 --> 01:59:25,026
For now.

1303
01:59:26,993 --> 01:59:28,200
Look.

1304
02:10:43,419 --> 02:10:44,785
It's a brave new world, my friend.

1305
02:10:45,755 --> 02:10:46,836
Such things as this...

1306
02:10:46,922 --> 02:10:49,289
become much more valuable
since the rise of the king.

1307
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:51,416
My men, they don't ask for much.

1308
02:10:52,094 --> 02:10:53,551
Can't fish here anymore.

1309
02:10:54,263 --> 02:10:55,754
Everything's dead.

1310
02:11:29,382 --> 02:11:31,248
We'll take it.
