Nobody.

Sisters don't keep secrets.

65
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,372
- Seriously, it was nobody.
- Well,

00:05:19,374 --> 00:05:21,173
I hope "nobody" used a condom.

And don't forget,

72
00:05:29,783 --> 00:05:31,416

- Living for it.

00:05:41,928 --> 00:05:44,329
Did I totally embarrass myself
last night?

76
00:05:44,331 --> 00:05:46,298
Not at all.

77
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,735
Unless you consider dancing on
a table, starting two fights,

78
00:05:49,737 --> 00:05:52,438
and barfing pretzel chunks
all over the bar embarrassing.

79
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,339
Please tell me you're kidding.

80
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:57,308
Oh, and you also rammed your
tongue down Nick Sims' throat

81
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,943
right in front of Danielle.

82
00:05:58,945 --> 00:06:00,712
Oh, God,

83
00:06:00,714 --> 00:06:02,981
but she was so nice to me
this morning.

84
00:06:02,983 --> 00:06:05,084
Yeah, I think she was
as drunk as you last night,

85
00:06:05,086 --> 00:06:06,317
so consider it
collective amnesia.

86
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,288
Oh, thank God for that.

87
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,961
Oh... crap,
I'm so late for class.

88
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,133

Ha!

90
00:06:25,305 --> 00:06:28,207

could keep it a secret from me?

91
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:30,442
- How did you find out?
- Driver's license.

92
00:06:30,444 --> 00:06:32,445
Not the best picture,
I might add.

93
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,247
- I assume you changed my ringer, too.
- Who, me?

94
00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:36,815
Never.

95
00:06:42,322 --> 00:06:43,723
What'd you wish for?

96
00:06:43,725 --> 00:06:45,093
- A new roommate.
- Wench.

- - Enter.

169
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:41,493

I've never heard anything

- How cute is it on me?

173

Whatever. Just don't get
anything on it, please.

181
00:11:06,654 --> 00:11:08,219
Okay. Bye-ee.

182
00:11:08,221 --> 00:11:10,321
- Bye-ee.
- Who took my hairdryer?

183
00:11:10,323 --> 00:11:11,926
Crazy bitch.

184
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:16,195
Teresa, it's Dad.

185
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:18,597
I sat in that restaurant
waiting for you

186
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:20,031
for over an hour.

187
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:21,632
I can't believe
you would do this to me,

188
00:11:21,634 --> 00:11:24,036
today of all days.

189
00:11:24,038 --> 00:11:25,738
- Whoo!
- Oh, yeah!

190
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,272
How you feel, baby!

191
00:11:28,274 --> 00:11:29,775
Hey, come on!

192
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,757
Okay, you guys are hilarious.

193
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:22,130
You can come out now.

194
00:12:24,298 --> 00:12:26,198
Losers.

195
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,788
Yo, I think your friends

196
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,493
went the other way.

197
00:12:58,099 --> 00:13:00,702
Can I help you?

198
00:13:03,537 --> 00:13:05,237
Look, weirdo,

199
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:07,638
I'm not scared.
Why don't you go try this

200
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,807
with one of the heifers
at Delta Gamma?

201
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:12,146
They're into cosplay.

202
00:13:19,452 --> 00:13:21,755
Okay, I'm calling the cops.

203
00:14:15,442 --> 00:14:18,576
Shut up!

204
00:14:18,578 --> 00:14:20,845
Oh, hey. You're up.

205
00:14:20,847 --> 00:14:22,915
♪ Yeah, it's my birthday... ♪

206
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:24,449
Yeah, I wasn't sure if you,

207
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:27,154
you know, wanted
to sleep in or not, so...

208
00:14:32,226 --> 00:14:33,658
Oh.

209
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,560
Right. Yeah.

210
00:14:35,562 --> 00:14:37,695
I folded your pants...
for you last night,

211
00:14:37,697 --> 00:14:41,532
and I wasn't sure if...
the material gets... wrinkled.

212
00:14:41,534 --> 00:14:43,137
Uh...

213
00:14:44,772 --> 00:14:47,339
I don't know if you remember
my name or not.

214
00:14:47,341 --> 00:14:49,641
You know, you were...
pretty wasted last night.

215
00:14:49,643 --> 00:14:50,842
But, uh...

216
00:14:50,844 --> 00:14:53,281
- I'm... I'm...
- Carter.

217
00:14:54,347 --> 00:14:55,980
You remembered.

218
00:14:58,318 --> 00:15:00,219
- Uh, Tylenol?
- What?

219
00:15:00,221 --> 00:15:02,753
Oh, my head is killing me...
do you have any Tylenol?

220
00:15:02,755 --> 00:15:05,357
Oh, uh... yes.

221
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:07,258
Um...

222
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,560
It's over there.

223
00:15:09,562 --> 00:15:11,229
Right.

224
00:15:11,231 --> 00:15:14,333
It's under your clothes,
on... on the...

225
00:15:14,335 --> 00:15:16,571
- Okay.
- Right. Right.

226
00:15:20,573 --> 00:15:22,541
Ah, thanks.

227
00:15:22,543 --> 00:15:23,610
And...

228
00:15:25,245 --> 00:15:27,247
It's like
you've been here before.

229
00:15:31,884 --> 00:15:33,755
Are you okay?

230
00:15:34,855 --> 00:15:36,490
Tree?

231
00:15:37,557 --> 00:15:39,427
Are you okay?

232
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:45,567
Dude, did you hit
that fine vagine or wha...

233
00:15:46,933 --> 00:15:48,435
Ooh.

234
00:15:51,772 --> 00:15:54,275
I'm... I'm sorry.

235
00:15:59,346 --> 00:16:02,948
Nice one, dickhead.

00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,027
Hey.

Um, sorry, no, thanks.

You... haven't returned
any of my texts.

254
00:17:03,843 --> 00:17:05,976
Tim, what day is it?

255
00:17:05,978 --> 00:17:09,013
Uh... Monday the 18th.

256
00:17:09,015 --> 00:17:10,916
You're sure?

257
00:17:10,918 --> 00:17:11,985
I'm pretty sure.

258
00:17:13,087 --> 00:17:14,789
I, um...

259
00:17:17,424 --> 00:17:19,494
I gotta go.

260
00:17:21,762 --> 00:17:23,398
Call me?

261
00:17:42,783 --> 00:17:44,049
Oh, my God.

262
00:17:44,051 --> 00:17:46,484
You sneaky little beyatch.

263
00:17:46,486 --> 00:17:48,355
Who was it?

264
00:17:51,158 --> 00:17:53,125
Sisters don't keep secrets.

265
00:17:54,995 --> 00:17:58,163
- I'm totally having déjà vu right now.
- Oh.

266
00:17:58,165 --> 00:18:00,165
I have it all the time.
It's supposed to mean, like,

267
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:02,134
someone's thinking about you
while they're masturbating.

268
00:18:02,136 --> 00:18:04,034
I have it at least
five times a day.

269
00:18:04,036 --> 00:18:07,672
Seriously, I've been having it
all day, it's so weird.

270
00:18:07,674 --> 00:18:10,509
Maybe you should switch
to water next time, hon.

271
00:18:10,511 --> 00:18:14,713
Uh, yeah, thanks.
I'll keep that in mind.

272
00:18:14,715 --> 00:18:16,814
What are sisters for? Oh!
And don't forget,

273
00:18:16,816 --> 00:18:18,553
house meeting at lunch.

274
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,153
Hello?

275
00:18:21,155 --> 00:18:23,588
It's been on the board
since last Thursday, Tree.

276
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:27,091
Yeah, I remember. I...

277
00:18:27,093 --> 00:18:28,562
Um...

278
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,197
She finally rolls in.

279
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:35,567
That's so weird.

280
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:37,101
You okay?

281
00:18:37,103 --> 00:18:38,736
You were kind of a mess
last night.

282
00:18:38,738 --> 00:18:40,172
Uh...

283
00:18:40,174 --> 00:18:43,610
Oh, shit,
I'm so late for class.

284
00:18:50,149 --> 00:18:52,486
Did you really think you could
keep it a secret from me?

285
00:18:56,023 --> 00:18:57,822
Don't you want to know
how I found out?

286
00:18:57,824 --> 00:18:58,990
Driver's license?

287
00:18:58,992 --> 00:19:00,192
Clever girl.

288
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,127
That picture, though?

289
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:04,029
I got to go.

290
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:05,563
But...

291
00:19:05,565 --> 00:19:07,668
you-you didn't even
blow out the...

292
00:19:08,534 --> 00:19:10,670
...candle.

293
00:19:12,206 --> 00:19:14,105
We really need
to step up our game

294
00:19:14,107 --> 00:19:15,474
at these frat parties, okay?

295
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:16,841
And...

296
00:19:16,843 --> 00:19:18,210
we still need to pick
this year's charity.

297
00:19:18,212 --> 00:19:20,579
I can say right now
there's no way

298
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:22,246
we're doing the Special Needs
Art Fair again.

299
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:25,216
Get your school spirit on
before the big game.

300
00:19:25,218 --> 00:19:29,122
Ten percent off
with your student ID.

301
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:35,092
T-shirts.

302
00:19:35,094 --> 00:19:39,030
What's wrong, Tree?

303
00:19:39,032 --> 00:19:42,133
Um, I'm just a little tired
I guess.

304
00:19:42,135 --> 00:19:43,801
No, dumbass.

305
00:19:43,803 --> 00:19:45,439
What's wrong with that?

306
00:19:48,242 --> 00:19:49,573
So not Kappa cuisine.

307
00:19:49,575 --> 00:19:52,276
And is that
chocolate milk I see?

308
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:54,178
I missed breakfast.

309
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,749
We all miss breakfast, Becky.

310
00:19:58,518 --> 00:19:59,583
Becky.

311
00:19:59,585 --> 00:20:00,987
Becky, look out.

312
00:20:02,121 --> 00:20:03,855
I'm...

313
00:20:03,857 --> 00:20:06,224
- so sorry. I'm sorry, Tree.
- Wait.

314
00:20:06,226 --> 00:20:07,759
You two know each other?

315
00:20:07,761 --> 00:20:09,727
- No.
- Yeah. I mean...

316
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:12,163
we had a...
a class together last year.

317
00:20:12,165 --> 00:20:13,098
That's all.

318
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,167
I'm sorry about all this.

319
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:19,839
Hey.

320
00:20:23,075 --> 00:20:24,275
What?

321
00:20:24,277 --> 00:20:25,310
My bracelet.

322
00:20:25,312 --> 00:20:26,714
Oh.

323
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:32,719
You know, I'm sorry again
about... you know, the mess.

324
00:20:34,921 --> 00:20:38,158
What a douchebag.

325
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,593
Hey, we can't do this today.

326
00:20:42,595 --> 00:20:44,128
There's too much going on
in the building.

327
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,697
I need to talk to you.

328
00:20:48,802 --> 00:20:51,669
Tree, I...

329
00:20:51,671 --> 00:20:53,304
I know what you're gonna say.

330
00:20:53,306 --> 00:20:54,606
You do?

331
00:20:54,608 --> 00:20:57,742
Look, it's normal

332
00:20:57,744 --> 00:21:01,946
for a young girl to have
feelings for an older man,

333
00:21:01,948 --> 00:21:03,281
but you can't fall in love.

334
00:21:03,283 --> 00:21:06,216
I'm not falling in love
with you.

335
00:21:06,218 --> 00:21:08,019
You're not?

336
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:11,826
No. I've been having
the weirdest day and... mmm.

337
00:21:14,226 --> 00:21:15,961
Your wife.

338
00:21:15,963 --> 00:21:19,864
Uh, that's kind of a buzzkill.

339
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:22,367
Gregory.

340
00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:23,702
Are you in there?

341
00:21:23,704 --> 00:21:25,139
Thank God you locked the door.

342
00:21:29,775 --> 00:21:32,042
Hey, sweetie.

343
00:21:32,044 --> 00:21:34,913
Uh, I didn't realize
I'd locked the door, um...

344
00:21:34,915 --> 00:21:35,981
uh, just wrapping up here.

345
00:21:35,983 --> 00:21:37,881
Have you met my student,
Teresa?

346
00:21:37,883 --> 00:21:39,350
No.

347
00:21:39,352 --> 00:21:41,720
I haven't.

348
00:21:41,722 --> 00:21:43,257

354
00:21:59,139 --> 00:22:00,638
I think I just spotted a bug.

Oh, I guess I'm

361
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:12,250
not having leftovers.

362
00:22:13,387 --> 00:22:15,720
...last minute
business meeting about opening

363
00:22:15,722 --> 00:22:17,422
- a new gym.
- I know.

364
00:22:17,424 --> 00:22:19,724
I'm just borrowing it
for tonight.

365
00:22:19,726 --> 00:22:21,792
What time you going
to the party?

366
00:22:21,794 --> 00:22:23,762
...to let that
bring me down, because...

367
00:22:23,764 --> 00:22:25,763
Hello?

368
00:22:25,765 --> 00:22:27,965
- Earth to space bitch.
- What?

369
00:22:27,967 --> 00:22:29,733
What time
are you going to the party?

370
00:22:29,735 --> 00:22:34,371
Uh, f... I don't know. Later.

372
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:41,045
Okay, whoa.

373
00:22:41,047 --> 00:22:43,714
Chill out. It's just another
rolling blackout, sweetie.

374
00:22:43,716 --> 00:22:45,983
- It happened before?
- Yeah.

375
00:22:45,985 --> 00:22:47,185
Like, two weeks ago.

376
00:22:47,187 --> 00:22:49,223
Anyhoo...
don't be too late

377
00:22:50,254 --> 00:22:52,057
or all the cute Sigma boys
will be taken.

378
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:55,359
Who took my hairdryer?

379
00:22:55,361 --> 00:22:57,428
Teresa, it's Dad.

380
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:00,464
I sat in that restaurant
waiting for you for over an...

381
00:23:18,118 --> 00:23:19,951
Yo, Mike.

382
00:23:19,953 --> 00:23:21,051
Come on, hurry up, man.

383
00:23:21,053 --> 00:23:22,389
Hold up.
I'm coming.

385
00:23:52,451 --> 00:23:54,854

387
00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:57,080
Surprise?

00:24:57,082 --> 00:25:00,318

389
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,985
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

Why is the door locked?

522
00:33:37,503 --> 00:33:41,972
Um, I-I just need
some alone time.

532

I've never heard anything

534

But I'm trying not
to let that bring me down,

535
00:34:13,005 --> 00:34:16,410
because I'm on my way
to pick up Jace.

536
00:34:18,111 --> 00:34:19,910
I'm just happy

537
00:34:19,912 --> 00:34:21,644
you're gonna
see Jace this morning.

538
00:34:21,646 --> 00:34:23,847
- I know.
- It's been, like, almost a month.

539
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:26,015
He's gonna be
so excited to see you.

540
00:34:26,017 --> 00:34:29,452
Where'd Lori put
the frickin' remote?

541
00:34:32,858 --> 00:34:35,059
- Hi, Jace!
- Hey, Jace!

542
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:36,861
Hey!

543
00:34:39,965 --> 00:34:41,999
- Hi.
- Hi.

544
00:34:42,001 --> 00:34:44,033
I'm Barbara.

545
00:34:44,035 --> 00:34:45,068
- I am Crystal.
- Hi.

546
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,403
Nice to meet you.

547
00:34:46,405 --> 00:34:49,807
- Can you say bye to Mamey?
- Bye.

548
00:34:49,809 --> 00:34:52,412
Stay buckled and have a good time...

549
00:34:53,546 --> 00:34:55,412
G-48!

550
00:34:55,414 --> 00:34:56,981
Ain't that great!

551
00:34:56,983 --> 00:34:59,582
- G-48!
- G-48!

552
00:35:19,005 --> 00:35:20,504
I don't know what's going on

553
00:35:20,506 --> 00:35:23,541
with you and that
other guy, okay?

554
00:35:23,543 --> 00:35:26,176
...is being treated for a gunshot wound

555
00:35:26,178 --> 00:35:28,211
following a deadly shootout
this morning

556
00:35:28,213 --> 00:35:30,448
that left one officer dead.

557
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,450
Tombs was the subject of...

558
00:37:11,017 --> 00:37:13,216
Do you go through
a can of hairspray

559
00:37:13,218 --> 00:37:15,285
trying to get that full,
volumized look?

560
00:37:15,287 --> 00:37:16,620
Then bump it up

561
00:37:16,622 --> 00:37:17,955
with Bumpits...

562
00:37:17,957 --> 00:37:19,923
...and get that
salon-style look,

563
00:37:19,925 --> 00:37:22,258
flat to fabulous, instantly.

564
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,028
Imagine being able
to create today's hottest...

565
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,981

this is even remotely possible,

you're stuck in this day, okay?

596
00:39:24,115 --> 00:39:25,749
Out of all the days
of your life,

597
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:27,117
what makes this day special?

598
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,751

Yeah.

603
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,028
- Hello?
- So? Birthdays are just excuses

604
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:40,064
to, like, eat cake
and open presents and shit.

605
00:39:40,066 --> 00:39:41,265
There's no real meaning
behind a birthday.

606
00:39:41,267 --> 00:39:43,066
No, it's symbolic, okay?

607
00:39:43,068 --> 00:39:45,070
Whoever's killing you
knows it's your birthday.

608
00:39:47,372 --> 00:39:49,175
All right, look.

609
00:39:50,408 --> 00:39:52,008
Give me a list of names

610
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:53,443
of everybody who knows
it's your birthday

611
00:39:53,445 --> 00:39:55,912
and whoever's trying
to kill you.

612
00:39:55,914 --> 00:39:58,948
Well, thanks to my sorority,
pretty much the entire school

613
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,850
knows it's my birthday.

614
00:40:00,852 --> 00:40:02,986
They're throwing me this stupid
surprise party tonight.

615
00:40:02,988 --> 00:40:05,756
I mean, it literally
could be anyone.

616
00:40:05,758 --> 00:40:07,894
I mean, who has motive?

617
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,930
Okay, maybe it's Danielle.

618
00:40:12,932 --> 00:40:15,265
- All right.
- Apparently, I made out with some guy she liked

619
00:40:15,267 --> 00:40:17,203
right in front of her
last night.

620
00:40:18,436 --> 00:40:19,738
Oh.

621
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:23,740
Oh. Must have been
before we met.

622
00:40:23,742 --> 00:40:25,374
Busy night?

623
00:40:25,376 --> 00:40:28,979
Okay, Mr. I'm Gonna Take
This Drunk Girl Home

624
00:40:28,981 --> 00:40:31,115
and Take Advantage of Her,
don't judge.

625
00:40:31,117 --> 00:40:33,517
For the record, I didn't take
advantage of you last night.

626
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:35,155
Okay? I slept on Ryan's bed.

627
00:40:36,789 --> 00:40:39,155
So, w... we didn't...

628
00:40:39,157 --> 00:40:40,490
- have s...
- No.

629
00:40:40,492 --> 00:40:42,059
You were wasted last night.

630
00:40:42,061 --> 00:40:44,128
And I was afraid
you were gonna fall

631
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:46,332
or choke on your own vomit,
like Janis Joplin.

632
00:40:55,106 --> 00:40:57,274
Uh, wh... what were we...

633
00:40:57,276 --> 00:40:58,876
- Suspects.
- Right, suspects.

634
00:40:58,878 --> 00:41:01,044
Um, okay, so Danielle.

635
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,213
There's... Gregory.

636
00:41:04,215 --> 00:41:05,849
Um, his wife.

637
00:41:05,851 --> 00:41:07,450
Creepy Tim.

638
00:41:07,452 --> 00:41:11,388
Oh. Um, that tiny girl from
T.J. Maxx that I got fired.

639
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:14,024
And maybe the Uber driver
that I spit on last week.

640
00:41:14,026 --> 00:41:15,559
I think his name was...

641
00:41:15,561 --> 00:41:18,231
What? Nobody's perfect.

642
00:41:19,298 --> 00:41:21,531
Okay, this isn't helping.

643
00:41:22,934 --> 00:41:24,834
This is pointless, isn't it?

644
00:41:24,836 --> 00:41:27,437
All right, look,
the way I see it is-is...

645
00:41:27,439 --> 00:41:30,339
you have unlimited amount
of lives,

646
00:41:30,341 --> 00:41:32,843
so you have unlimited
opportunities to solve

647
00:41:32,845 --> 00:41:36,180
- your own murder.
- So I'm just supposed to keep dying

648
00:41:36,182 --> 00:41:39,015
until I figure out
who my killer is?

649
00:41:39,017 --> 00:41:42,354

00:45:07,059 --> 00:45:09,559
Your plan totally sucks.

716
00:45:09,561 --> 00:45:10,561
What?

717
00:45:17,302 --> 00:45:18,769
I don't know if you remember
my name or not.

718
00:45:18,771 --> 00:45:21,671
You know, you were...
pretty wasted last night.

719
00:45:21,673 --> 00:45:24,106
Um... but I'm Carter.

720
00:45:24,108 --> 00:45:25,341
Are you okay?

721
00:45:25,343 --> 00:45:27,646
Never better.

722
00:45:34,419 --> 00:45:36,586
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I'm-I'm fine.

723
00:45:36,588 --> 00:45:39,155
Dude, did you hit
that fine vagine or wha...

724
00:45:39,157 --> 00:45:41,258
'Sup? Hey, um...

725
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:44,093
I'm sorry to bother
you guys, uh...

726
00:45:50,769 --> 00:45:52,501
Uh... Carter?

727
00:45:52,503 --> 00:45:54,172
Please? A little help? Carter?

728
00:46:32,177 --> 00:46:33,443
Tree.

729
00:46:34,546 --> 00:46:35,579
Hey, hey, hey. Calm down.

730
00:46:35,581 --> 00:46:36,812
It's-it's just me.

731
00:46:38,851 --> 00:46:40,753
How you doing?

732
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,387
What... what happened?

733
00:46:44,389 --> 00:46:47,189
You... you collapsed
this morning.

734
00:46:47,191 --> 00:46:48,225
What day is it?

735
00:46:48,227 --> 00:46:50,227
Uh, it's Monday.

736
00:46:50,229 --> 00:46:51,260
What's the date?

737
00:46:51,262 --> 00:46:54,430
Uh, it's... the 18th.

738
00:46:54,432 --> 00:46:57,501
Oh, we've been trying to get
in contact with your parents,

739
00:46:57,503 --> 00:46:58,568
but for some reason...

740
00:47:03,374 --> 00:47:05,142
- Geez!
- Can I help you?

741
00:47:05,144 --> 00:47:06,376
Uh, I'm just...

742
00:47:06,378 --> 00:47:07,776
- I'm checking on her.
- It's okay.

743
00:47:07,778 --> 00:47:11,280
- He's a friend.
- Sorry. Visiting hours are over.

744
00:47:11,282 --> 00:47:12,784
Got it.

745
00:47:13,885 --> 00:47:15,521
Thanks, Carter.

746
00:47:16,889 --> 00:47:18,758
Feel better.

747
00:47:21,392 --> 00:47:23,392
When can I get out of here?

748
00:47:28,267 --> 00:47:31,704
Uh, I'm having a hard time
pulling your medical records.

749
00:47:33,905 --> 00:47:35,539
Why?

750
00:47:35,541 --> 00:47:38,841
We just got these back
from imaging,

751
00:47:38,843 --> 00:47:40,776
and these are signs of...

752
00:47:40,778 --> 00:47:42,745
major trauma.

753
00:47:42,747 --> 00:47:45,515
I mean, given the severity
of the scar tissue

754
00:47:45,517 --> 00:47:47,520
and the size of the lesions...

755
00:47:49,854 --> 00:47:52,789
This is gonna sound
crazy, but...

756
00:47:52,791 --> 00:47:56,495
technically...
you should be dead.

757
00:48:00,265 --> 00:48:02,566
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing?

758
00:48:02,568 --> 00:48:04,466
- I need to get out of here.
- No way.

759
00:48:04,468 --> 00:48:05,968
No, you need to stay here
for observation.

760
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:07,903
If I don't get out of here,
I'm gonna die.

761
00:48:07,905 --> 00:48:09,673
- I need to go...
- Tree, Tree, shh, shh.

762
00:48:09,675 --> 00:48:11,274
Listen to me.

763
00:48:11,276 --> 00:48:14,547
You are absolutely safe here.

764
00:48:18,383 --> 00:48:20,816
Okay.

765
00:48:20,818 --> 00:48:23,523
I won't let anything
happen to you.

766
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,794
I'm really thirsty.

767
00:48:30,796 --> 00:48:32,796
Could you get me a soda?

768
00:48:32,798 --> 00:48:34,500
Sure.

769
00:48:35,601 --> 00:48:37,236
Thank you.

770
00:49:00,024 --> 00:49:02,861
Special delivery.

771
00:49:35,626 --> 00:49:37,593
Keys, keys, keys.

772
00:49:37,595 --> 00:49:39,231
Shit.

773
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,502
Oh, Gregory, where are
the car keys? Come on.

774
00:50:46,765 --> 00:50:47,830
Tree, Tree, it's okay.

775
00:50:47,832 --> 00:50:50,100
It's okay.
It's just me.

776
00:50:50,102 --> 00:50:51,704
Gregory, look out!

777
00:50:52,838 --> 00:50:55,508
No.

778
00:51:05,916 --> 00:51:07,352
No!

779
00:51:18,697 --> 00:51:20,095
Oh, my God. Come on.

780
00:51:20,097 --> 00:51:21,097
Come on, no.

781
00:52:34,072 --> 00:52:35,705
Oh...

782
00:52:35,707 --> 00:52:37,740
No.

783
00:53:16,113 --> 00:53:17,847
I did it.

784
00:53:17,849 --> 00:53:19,281
I did it!

785
00:53:19,283 --> 00:53:21,251
I did it!

786
00:53:23,622 --> 00:53:26,021
Yeah!

787
00:53:26,023 --> 00:53:28,624
Catch me now, bitch!

788
00:53:35,066 --> 00:53:36,533
What?

789
00:53:36,535 --> 00:53:39,001
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

790
00:53:39,003 --> 00:53:40,135
Come on!

791
00:53:40,137 --> 00:53:41,771
No!

792
00:53:41,773 --> 00:53:43,606
Oh, sh... shit!

793
00:53:59,057 --> 00:54:01,026
Shit, shit, shit.

794
00:54:02,994 --> 00:54:05,260
I know I was speeding,
Officer.

795
00:54:05,262 --> 00:54:07,499
- I just...
- Turn off the engine, please.

796
00:54:09,066 --> 00:54:10,633
Yes, Officer.

797
00:54:10,635 --> 00:54:13,602
License and registration.

798
00:54:13,604 --> 00:54:15,139
I, um...

799
00:54:18,209 --> 00:54:19,745
I don't have it.

800
00:54:20,811 --> 00:54:22,345
Pardon me?

801
00:54:22,347 --> 00:54:23,613
He's trying to kill me again.

802
00:54:23,615 --> 00:54:25,582
- Again?
- Yes.

803
00:54:25,584 --> 00:54:26,649
I mean, no, I me...

804
00:54:26,651 --> 00:54:28,785
he was trying before,
but this time I got away.

805
00:54:28,787 --> 00:54:30,753
But I-I-I didn't have time
to grab my clothes

806
00:54:30,755 --> 00:54:32,655
and my driver's license
is in my pocket.

807
00:54:35,827 --> 00:54:37,760
Ma'am, are you under
the influence of alcohol

808
00:54:37,762 --> 00:54:39,062
or any other
controlled substance?

809
00:54:39,064 --> 00:54:41,233
No!
That is what I'm trying to...

810
00:54:45,035 --> 00:54:46,868
Wait.

811
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:50,839
If I am, does that mean that
you're going to arrest me

812
00:54:50,841 --> 00:54:52,341
and lock me in a jail cell?

813
00:54:52,343 --> 00:54:54,676
That's how it usually works.

814
00:54:54,678 --> 00:54:55,678
I'm drunk.

815
00:54:57,749 --> 00:54:58,914
You are?

816
00:54:58,916 --> 00:55:00,383
Wasted.
And I'm high.

817
00:55:00,385 --> 00:55:01,917
You know, pills, weed.

818
00:55:01,919 --> 00:55:03,255
You name it, man, I'm on it.

819
00:55:05,323 --> 00:55:08,191
Uh, well...

820
00:55:08,193 --> 00:55:10,896
then I'm gonna put you
under arrest.

821
00:55:12,796 --> 00:55:14,300
That's a good idea.

822
00:55:15,367 --> 00:55:17,233
Let me help you.

823
00:55:17,235 --> 00:55:19,204
Um, all right.

824
00:55:23,273 --> 00:55:25,207
You know,
never been arrested before.

825
00:55:25,209 --> 00:55:26,209
Uh-huh.

826
00:55:30,849 --> 00:55:33,082
- Thank you!
- All units,

827
00:55:33,084 --> 00:55:35,017
we got a 187
at University Hospital.

828
00:55:35,019 --> 00:55:36,952
Suspect is believed...

829
00:55:36,954 --> 00:55:38,754
No!

830
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:58,207
Shit. Oh, God, get me out!

831
00:55:59,244 --> 00:56:01,347
Get me out,
get me out!

832
00:56:14,693 --> 00:56:16,758
What do you want?!

833
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,896
Why are you doing this to me?!

834
00:56:19,898 --> 00:56:21,930
Who are you?

835
00:56:21,932 --> 00:56:24,035
Show your face, you pussy!

836
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:33,812
Where are you going?!

837
00:56:59,137 --> 00:57:01,240
Oh, shit!

838
00:57:17,856 --> 00:57:20,059
Oh, fuck.

839
00:57:33,204 --> 00:57:34,269
Oh, hey.

840
00:57:34,271 --> 00:57:37,106
- You're up.
- Silence!

841
00:57:38,843 --> 00:57:40,309
♪ Yeah, it's my birthday ♪

842
00:57:41,278 --> 00:57:43,044
♪ And I ain't gotta
pick up the phone. ♪

843
00:57:46,517 --> 00:57:48,151
Wait, you been here before?

844
00:57:48,153 --> 00:57:50,820
Hey, uh, you know,
I don't think you should be

845
00:57:50,822 --> 00:57:52,254
taking that many.
I mean, you could...

846
00:57:52,256 --> 00:57:54,089
you could die.

847
00:57:54,091 --> 00:57:56,158
If only it were that easy.

848
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,193
Water, por favor.

849
00:57:58,195 --> 00:57:59,195
Come on.

850
00:58:01,231 --> 00:58:02,266
- Here you go.
- Mm.

851
00:58:05,403 --> 00:58:07,238
Ah.

852
00:58:10,941 --> 00:58:12,108
Dude, did you hit that...

853
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:13,142
Hi.

854
00:58:13,144 --> 00:58:15,010
I'm the so-called fine vagine.

855
00:58:15,012 --> 00:58:17,146
And if that's the way
that you refer to girls,

856
00:58:17,148 --> 00:58:18,481
you and your hand
are going to have

857
00:58:18,483 --> 00:58:20,052
a very lasting relationship.

858
00:58:20,852 --> 00:58:22,154
Have a nice day.

859
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:27,022
What?

860
00:58:27,024 --> 00:58:28,356
I mean, are you...

861
00:58:28,358 --> 00:58:30,026
you always this charming
in the morning?

862
00:58:30,028 --> 00:58:32,765
Mm. Just this one.

863
00:58:36,033 --> 00:58:38,466
So were you having a bad dream
or something?

864
00:58:38,468 --> 00:58:39,836
Sorry?

865
00:58:39,838 --> 00:58:41,370
You were just... screaming

866
00:58:41,372 --> 00:58:43,004
- before you woke up.
- Oh.

867
00:58:43,006 --> 00:58:44,240
Well...

868
00:58:44,242 --> 00:58:46,242
I was dying.

869
00:58:46,244 --> 00:58:47,910
Again.

870
00:58:47,912 --> 00:58:48,945
What?

871
00:58:48,947 --> 00:58:51,082
Uh, it's a long story.

872
00:58:53,283 --> 00:58:55,050
Well, I mean,
I-I've got, you know, time.

873
00:58:55,052 --> 00:58:57,253
I'm not doing anything today,
if-if you want to...

874
00:58:57,255 --> 00:58:59,888
Seriously?

875
00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:01,890
I hate this sticker.

876
00:59:07,131 --> 00:59:09,064
Hey, wait!

877
00:59:09,066 --> 00:59:10,999
Why are you following me?

878
00:59:11,001 --> 00:59:12,501
I... I want to hear your story.

879
00:59:12,503 --> 00:59:14,370
Look, no offense,
but the last time

880
00:59:14,372 --> 00:59:16,472
I explained it to you,
it got me nowhere.

881
00:59:16,474 --> 00:59:18,608
So...

882
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:20,175
"The last time"?

883
00:59:20,177 --> 00:59:21,878
Hey.

884
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,213
So you're-you're having
bad dreams.

885
00:59:24,215 --> 00:59:26,214
I took an elective course
on neurocognition

886
00:59:26,216 --> 00:59:28,216
- in dream content.
- Mm. Hooray for you.

887
00:59:28,218 --> 00:59:30,151
I'm just saying, I-I...

888
00:59:30,153 --> 00:59:32,053
I might be able to help, you know?

889
00:59:32,055 --> 00:59:34,656
Can you help me stop reliving
the same day over and over,

890
00:59:34,658 --> 00:59:38,160
only to be murdered by someone
I may or may not know?

891
00:59:38,162 --> 00:59:39,495
Yeah. Thought so.

892
00:59:39,497 --> 00:59:41,834
- Stop global warming?
- Mm.

893
00:59:44,135 --> 00:59:47,269
So, wait, you literally think
you're reliving the same day?

894
00:59:47,271 --> 00:59:48,470
Yep.

895
00:59:48,472 --> 00:59:49,638
And somebody kills you?

896
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,640

We'd go to the beach.

943
01:01:51,729 --> 01:01:56,765
My dad would buy us
this, like, huge birthday cake

944
01:01:56,767 --> 01:01:59,702
and put just one candle on it.

945
01:01:59,704 --> 01:02:02,171

You relive the same day over

950
01:02:13,785 --> 01:02:17,990

she'd be very proud.

954
01:02:28,332 --> 01:02:29,698
Don't say that.

955
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,636
It's true.

956
01:02:32,803 --> 01:02:35,439
I'm not a good person, Carter.

957
01:02:36,807 --> 01:02:39,477
Maybe this is karma.
Maybe I deserve it.

958
01:02:43,514 --> 01:02:46,649
Well, look, I don't...
know you all that well,

959

if what you're saying is true.

01:02:53,356 --> 01:02:55,825
it's a chance
to be somebody better.

See, that's just it.

01:10:11,794 --> 01:10:13,661
No, we did not have sex,

1076
01:10:13,663 --> 01:10:15,964
but if I finally make it
through this day somehow,

1077
01:10:15,966 --> 01:10:17,299
I'm gonna have his babies.

1078
01:10:17,301 --> 01:10:18,970
Lots to do; gotta go.

1079
01:10:21,171 --> 01:10:23,007
She finally rolls in.

1080
01:10:31,181 --> 01:10:33,782
What's wrong? Ugh...

1081
01:10:33,784 --> 01:10:34,950
Um, nothing.

1082
01:10:34,952 --> 01:10:36,250
No, it's...

1083
01:10:36,252 --> 01:10:38,185
Look, Lori,

1084
01:10:38,187 --> 01:10:41,191
I have been the worst roommate.

1085
01:10:42,626 --> 01:10:44,625
You've always been there
for me,

1086
01:10:44,627 --> 01:10:47,295
but I've been way too selfish
to even appreciate it.

1087
01:10:47,297 --> 01:10:49,932
Can we start over?

1088
01:10:49,934 --> 01:10:52,669
I promise not to be
such a loser.

1089
01:10:55,306 --> 01:10:56,304
Are you high?

1090
01:10:56,306 --> 01:10:58,740
On life.

1091
01:11:01,211 --> 01:11:03,010
Oh! By the way,

1092
01:11:03,012 --> 01:11:04,716
I want to hear about
this mystery guy.

1093
01:11:06,984 --> 01:11:09,050
When extreme agitation occurs,

1094
01:11:09,052 --> 01:11:11,652
locomotive response
in the subject shows

1095
01:11:11,654 --> 01:11:13,090
- an acceleration...
- Dr. Butler.

1096
01:11:14,091 --> 01:11:16,727
Can I have a word, please?

1097
01:11:23,867 --> 01:11:25,299
What the hell do...

1098
01:11:25,301 --> 01:11:27,835
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

1099
01:11:27,837 --> 01:11:29,039
I'm ending this.

1100
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:32,910
Wait, what?

1101
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:36,344
I never should've
started seeing you.

1102
01:11:36,346 --> 01:11:38,112
It was wrong,

1103
01:11:38,114 --> 01:11:40,048
and I...

1104
01:11:42,151 --> 01:11:44,286
Anyway, I can't change
what I've done,

1105
01:11:44,288 --> 01:11:46,691
but I can start trying
to be a better person today.

1106
01:11:50,226 --> 01:11:52,393
What lame little self-help book
did you get that from?

1107
01:11:53,663 --> 01:11:55,162
You know what?

1108
01:11:55,164 --> 01:11:57,668
You have a wife
who loves you so much.

1109
01:11:59,136 --> 01:12:00,868
So if you can't
be faithful to her,

1110
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:02,640
at least have the balls
to leave.

1111
01:12:05,141 --> 01:12:08,076
Don't expect me to let you
coast by in my class now.

1112
01:12:08,078 --> 01:12:10,148
Already dropped it.

1113
01:12:16,285 --> 01:12:17,952
I just have to say

1114
01:12:17,954 --> 01:12:21,389
how totally sad
and disappointing it is

1115
01:12:21,391 --> 01:12:24,259
when certain people
can't be bothered to make it

1116
01:12:24,261 --> 01:12:26,260
to a mandatory house meeting.

1117
01:12:26,262 --> 01:12:29,066
We were supposed to be picking
this year's charity.

1118
01:12:30,767 --> 01:12:32,733
Becky?

1119
01:12:32,735 --> 01:12:34,005
Is that chocolate milk I see?

1120
01:12:35,072 --> 01:12:36,772
I skipped breakfast...

1121
01:12:36,774 --> 01:12:38,106
Oh!

1122
01:12:38,108 --> 01:12:41,042
Mmm. Mmm.

1123
01:12:41,044 --> 01:12:42,376
Mmm!

1124
01:12:42,378 --> 01:12:44,813
Oh, my God! That is so good.

1125
01:12:44,815 --> 01:12:46,113
What's up with the fat fest?

1126
01:12:46,115 --> 01:12:47,249
We're Kappas.

1127
01:12:47,251 --> 01:12:49,084
Come on, hon, live a little.

1128
01:12:49,086 --> 01:12:50,187
Few calories won't kill ya.

1129
01:12:51,288 --> 01:12:53,054
No.

1130
01:12:53,056 --> 01:12:55,057
It'll just turn me
into a chunker.

1131
01:12:55,059 --> 01:12:56,860
Like Becky here.

1132
01:13:00,764 --> 01:13:01,999
Okay.

1133
01:13:21,752 --> 01:13:23,350
Oh, my God!

1134
01:13:25,756 --> 01:13:26,955
You'll be okay!

1135
01:13:26,957 --> 01:13:28,490
Hey, Tree?

1136
01:13:28,492 --> 01:13:29,457
Hey.

1137
01:13:29,459 --> 01:13:31,395
Just, uh, coming by to...

1138
01:13:39,203 --> 01:13:41,469
What was that for?

1139
01:13:41,471 --> 01:13:45,040
I have to run, but what are you
doing later tonight?

1140
01:13:45,042 --> 01:13:46,741
Nothing.

1141
01:13:46,743 --> 01:13:48,210
Do you want to take me out
for my birthday?

1142
01:13:48,212 --> 01:13:50,845
What's the punch line?

1143
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,347
Look, I know
it's really random,

1144
01:13:52,349 --> 01:13:54,215
but I promise I'll explain
everything tomorrow.

1145
01:13:54,217 --> 01:13:56,451
Assuming there is one.

1146
01:13:56,453 --> 01:13:57,451
Just say yes.

1147
01:13:57,453 --> 01:14:00,322
All right. Yeah.

1148
01:14:00,324 --> 01:14:01,426
Yeah.

1149
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:04,227
Great.

1150
01:14:19,909 --> 01:14:21,311
Excuse me.

1151
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:25,112
Can I pay for my coffee,
please?

1152
01:14:25,114 --> 01:14:26,113
You're not gonna eat?

1153
01:14:26,115 --> 01:14:28,215
No, just the check, please.

1154
01:14:28,217 --> 01:14:30,518
I'll be right back.

1155
01:14:38,796 --> 01:14:41,865
Hi, Daddy. Sorry I'm late.

1156
01:14:43,833 --> 01:14:45,936
Like your tie.

1157
01:14:48,372 --> 01:14:49,905
Thanks.

1158
01:14:49,907 --> 01:14:51,973
How's school?

1159
01:14:51,975 --> 01:14:53,441
Fine.

1160
01:14:53,443 --> 01:14:55,143
Like your classes?

1161
01:14:55,145 --> 01:14:57,211
They're fine, Dad.

1162
01:14:57,213 --> 01:14:59,514
I don't want to do that
anymore.

1163
01:14:59,516 --> 01:15:00,915
Do what?

1164
01:15:00,917 --> 01:15:03,518
Small talk.

1165
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,254
It's just that...

1166
01:15:06,256 --> 01:15:08,122
this day...

1167
01:15:08,124 --> 01:15:11,229
this day is really...
hard for me.

1168
01:15:12,596 --> 01:15:15,066
And, um...

1169
01:15:17,834 --> 01:15:19,334
I miss Mom.

1170
01:15:19,336 --> 01:15:22,103
You know?
I miss her so much.

1171
01:15:22,105 --> 01:15:24,442
I miss the way that she smells.

1172
01:15:26,209 --> 01:15:28,276
I miss that crazy horse laugh

1173
01:15:28,278 --> 01:15:30,248
she has.

1174
01:15:31,347 --> 01:15:32,546
Yeah.

1175
01:15:32,548 --> 01:15:33,581
Me, too.

1176
01:15:33,583 --> 01:15:36,250
And I...

1177
01:15:36,252 --> 01:15:38,620
I guess I thought that if

1178
01:15:38,622 --> 01:15:42,189
I avoided all of it...

1179
01:15:42,191 --> 01:15:43,457
if I avoided you...

1180
01:15:43,459 --> 01:15:45,626
that somehow
it would be easier.

1181
01:15:45,628 --> 01:15:47,465
But it's not.

1182
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,535
It's been so much worse.

1183
01:15:54,503 --> 01:15:58,108
All of this running and hiding
has made me so miserable.

1184
01:16:00,142 --> 01:16:03,945
And I think
I finally figured it out.

1185
01:16:03,947 --> 01:16:09,317
For me, it took something,
like, totally crazy, but...

1186
01:16:09,319 --> 01:16:10,986
but I'm here.

1187
01:16:10,988 --> 01:16:13,588
And I love you.

1188
01:16:13,590 --> 01:16:17,427
And I am so, so sorry
that I hurt you.

1189
01:16:28,639 --> 01:16:30,639
Happy birthday, baby.

1190
01:17:06,208 --> 01:17:08,509
Stay calm.

1191
01:17:08,511 --> 01:17:10,111
I need you to stand up.

1192
01:17:10,113 --> 01:17:11,249
Slowly.

1193
01:17:15,185 --> 01:17:17,352
Slowly.

1194
01:17:17,354 --> 01:17:18,623
Okay, good.

1195
01:17:22,725 --> 01:17:25,593
Okay, this-this is
a really bad idea.

1196
01:17:25,595 --> 01:17:28,228
Okay, well, so is dying
for the 16th time.

1197
01:17:28,230 --> 01:17:30,432
Okay.

1198
01:17:30,434 --> 01:17:32,403
Now turn around.

1199
01:17:35,005 --> 01:17:36,737
I need you to listen to me.

1200
01:17:36,739 --> 01:17:37,738
He's going to escape.

1201
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:40,407
We can talk about this.
Just put the gun down.

1202
01:17:40,409 --> 01:17:43,210
He's going to escape.
Go get help.

1203
01:17:43,212 --> 01:17:45,282
- Go!
- Okay.

1204
01:18:29,426 --> 01:18:31,593
I know you're not asleep.

1205
01:18:31,595 --> 01:18:33,230
Open your eyes.

1206
01:18:40,636 --> 01:18:42,706
Safety's on, little girl.

1207
01:18:49,311 --> 01:18:52,112
Ah, ah, what do we have here?

1208
01:18:52,114 --> 01:18:53,581
Hmm?

1209
01:18:57,319 --> 01:19:00,722
You know, real nice surprise,

1210
01:19:00,724 --> 01:19:02,624
you coming to visit me
like this.

1211
01:19:12,802 --> 01:19:15,006
Whew. I like you.

1212
01:19:16,605 --> 01:19:18,074
Damn shame.

1213
01:19:20,109 --> 01:19:22,576
But you're a feisty
little shit, ain't you?

1214
01:19:26,248 --> 01:19:28,183
That's right.
Crawl, little girl, crawl.

1215
01:19:29,552 --> 01:19:31,820
Or...

1216
01:19:31,822 --> 01:19:35,356
I'll just make this one
real quick for you, okay?

1217
01:19:48,805 --> 01:19:49,805
Hey!

1218
01:19:50,739 --> 01:19:51,872
Safety's off.

1219
01:19:51,874 --> 01:19:53,808
Thanks for the tip.

1220
01:20:06,823 --> 01:20:09,360
<i>Who took my hairdryer?</i>

1221
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:14,862
So, this has got to be, like,

1222
01:20:14,864 --> 01:20:16,865
the strangest birthday
you've ever had, huh?

1223
01:20:16,867 --> 01:20:18,668
You have no idea.

1224
01:20:20,770 --> 01:20:23,438
Did you ever figure out
how Tombs got free?

1225
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:24,872
No.

1226
01:20:24,874 --> 01:20:26,140
No one knows.

1227
01:20:26,142 --> 01:20:28,308
It's kind of like Houdini.

1228
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:29,410
Yeah.

1229
01:20:29,412 --> 01:20:30,448
I guess.

1230
01:20:41,224 --> 01:20:43,226
What are you gonna wish for?

1231
01:20:46,562 --> 01:20:48,396
Tomorrow.

1232
01:20:48,398 --> 01:20:49,764
Tomorrow?

1233
01:20:49,766 --> 01:20:50,898
That's...

1234
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:52,700
I mean,
isn't that kind of a given?

1235
01:20:53,904 --> 01:20:56,107
You want to aim
for anything higher?

1236
01:20:57,306 --> 01:20:58,773
No.

1237
01:20:58,775 --> 01:21:01,278
Tomorrow's good enough for me.

1238
01:21:23,432 --> 01:21:24,933
Shut up!

1239
01:21:24,935 --> 01:21:26,533
♪ Yeah, it's my birthday ♪

1240
01:21:26,535 --> 01:21:29,269
♪ And I ain't gotta
pick up the phone ♪

1241
01:21:29,271 --> 01:21:31,206
Oh, hey. You're up.

1242
01:21:31,208 --> 01:21:32,874
- ♪ It's my birthday... ♪
- Carter?

1243
01:21:32,876 --> 01:21:34,274
Yeah.

1244
01:21:34,276 --> 01:21:35,509
I'm surprised
you remember my name.

1245
01:21:35,511 --> 01:21:36,510
You were pretty wasted
last night.

1246
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,679
This can't be happening.

1247
01:21:37,681 --> 01:21:38,679
This can't
be happening.

1248
01:21:38,681 --> 01:21:40,348
- What?
- I killed him!

1249
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:42,517
I stopped it!

1250
01:21:42,519 --> 01:21:44,451
Who?
What are you talking about?

1251
01:21:46,389 --> 01:21:48,590
What's going on?

1252
01:21:48,592 --> 01:21:49,857
I mean, look, you were probably

1253
01:21:49,859 --> 01:21:51,491
just having a bad dream
or something.

1254
01:21:51,493 --> 01:21:52,292
That happens to me
all the time

1255
01:21:52,294 --> 01:21:54,899
when I'm drinking.
You know, I...

1256
01:21:56,833 --> 01:21:59,470
Nice one. Dickhead.

1257
01:22:00,502 --> 01:22:03,206
She finally rolls in.

1258
01:22:05,574 --> 01:22:06,874
Going somewhere?

1259
01:22:06,876 --> 01:22:08,809
Yes.

1260
01:22:08,811 --> 01:22:10,844
As far away as possible.

1261
01:22:10,846 --> 01:22:11,912
Tree, what's wrong?

1262
01:22:11,914 --> 01:22:14,448
Me. I was wrong.

1263
01:22:14,450 --> 01:22:16,651
I thought if I stopped running,
that I could beat it.

1264
01:22:16,653 --> 01:22:18,419
But it's never gonna stop!

1265
01:22:18,421 --> 01:22:19,687
Tree, you're freaking me out.

1266
01:22:19,689 --> 01:22:21,926
Oh, well!
That's me, a freak!

1267
01:22:29,999 --> 01:22:32,399
Tree...

1268
01:22:32,401 --> 01:22:33,503
Tree, look.

1269
01:22:36,006 --> 01:22:38,339
Happy birthday.

1270
01:22:38,341 --> 01:22:41,512
Thanks, but I already ate it
last night.

1271
01:22:48,017 --> 01:22:50,785
Oh, my God.

1272
01:22:50,787 --> 01:22:54,656
I died in my sleep.

1273
01:22:54,658 --> 01:22:55,758
What?

1274
01:22:59,529 --> 01:23:01,532
You killed me.

1275
01:23:02,966 --> 01:23:04,501
What?

1276
01:23:06,502 --> 01:23:08,438
You poisoned it.

1277
01:23:09,739 --> 01:23:12,409
But I never ate it before.

1278
01:23:18,047 --> 01:23:21,348
So you had to find another way.

1279
01:23:21,350 --> 01:23:24,354
Then Tombs fell
right into your lap.

1280
01:23:26,523 --> 01:23:28,525
<i>Perfect scapegoat.</i>

1281
01:23:32,095 --> 01:23:33,896
<i>You had access to him.</i>

1282
01:23:35,597 --> 01:23:37,467
Did you drug him first?

1283
01:23:44,774 --> 01:23:46,607
<i>You knew that if he escaped,</i>

1284
01:23:46,609 --> 01:23:48,169
everyone would assume
that he killed me.

1285
01:23:49,546 --> 01:23:53,514
<i>But it was always you.</i>

1286
01:23:56,919 --> 01:23:58,018
Tree, are...

1287
01:23:58,020 --> 01:23:59,586
is this a joke?

1288
01:23:59,588 --> 01:24:01,488
You think I would
actually try to poison you

1289
01:24:01,490 --> 01:24:02,523
with a freakin' cupcake?

1290
01:24:04,026 --> 01:24:07,094
Okay, then.

1291
01:24:07,096 --> 01:24:08,698
Prove it.

1292
01:24:13,069 --> 01:24:15,937
Go on, Lori.

1293
01:24:15,939 --> 01:24:18,139
Take a bite.

1294
01:24:21,110 --> 01:24:23,777
Go on, Lori.

1295
01:24:23,779 --> 01:24:26,080
You really are crazy.

1296
01:24:26,082 --> 01:24:28,482
Okay, then.

1297
01:24:28,484 --> 01:24:29,850
I'll take it
down to the police.

1298
01:24:29,852 --> 01:24:31,118
I'm sure they can tell us

1299
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,556
what your little
birthday treat is made of.

1300
01:24:42,132 --> 01:24:44,499
You stupid little whore.

1301
01:24:44,501 --> 01:24:45,933
I know I've been
a bad roommate,

1302
01:24:45,935 --> 01:24:48,001
but isn't this a bit much?

1303
01:24:48,003 --> 01:24:49,003
What the hell?!

1304
01:24:49,005 --> 01:24:50,670
Oh, I don't know,

1305
01:24:50,672 --> 01:24:53,040
maybe because you wouldn't stop
sleeping with him.

1306
01:24:53,042 --> 01:24:55,009
What?

1307
01:24:55,011 --> 01:24:56,580
Gregory?

1308
01:24:58,515 --> 01:25:00,680
But he just kept choosing you.

1309
01:25:00,682 --> 01:25:02,950
Over me.

1310
01:25:02,952 --> 01:25:05,920
Guess all he wanted
was a cheap slut like you!

1311
01:25:05,922 --> 01:25:07,621
Wait.

1312
01:25:07,623 --> 01:25:11,158
You've been killing me
over some stupid guy?

1313
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:13,527
Oh, that's not the only reason.

1314
01:25:13,529 --> 01:25:16,430
You're a dumb bitch, too!

1315
01:25:16,432 --> 01:25:19,369
But what I really want
to know is...

1316
01:25:21,437 --> 01:25:23,704
...how did you figure it out?

1317
01:25:23,706 --> 01:25:26,072
Because you've killed me
before.

1318
01:25:29,979 --> 01:25:32,416
Then I guess I'm just gonna
have to do it again.

1319
01:25:52,901 --> 01:25:54,768
Ow.

1320
01:25:54,770 --> 01:25:56,137
Ow! Ah!

1321
01:25:56,139 --> 01:25:57,772
No! Bitch!

1322
01:25:57,774 --> 01:26:00,575
No!

1323
01:26:01,677 --> 01:26:03,009
What the hell
is going on in there?

1324
01:26:03,011 --> 01:26:04,211
Nothing.

1325
01:26:04,213 --> 01:26:05,580
Tree just fell.

1326
01:26:05,582 --> 01:26:06,781
Everything's fine.

1327
01:26:06,783 --> 01:26:08,715
Whatever. Clumsy hoes.

1328
01:26:08,717 --> 01:26:10,084
I better see you
at the meeting today.

1329
01:26:10,086 --> 01:26:11,853
We'll be there.

1330
01:26:14,056 --> 01:26:16,126
Eat it, bitch!

1331
01:26:53,863 --> 01:26:56,563
What are you losers
doing in there?

1332
01:26:56,565 --> 01:26:58,799
Lori...

1333
01:26:58,801 --> 01:27:01,134
ate...

1334
01:27:01,136 --> 01:27:03,539
my cupcake.

1335
01:27:13,882 --> 01:27:16,116
<i>I just knew there
was something wrong with Lori.</i>

1336
01:27:16,118 --> 01:27:17,751
She never wore makeup,

1337
01:27:17,753 --> 01:27:19,687
never posted any cute selfies,

1338
01:27:19,689 --> 01:27:20,955
and she literally

1339
01:27:20,957 --> 01:27:22,790
owned a pair of Crocs.

1340
01:27:22,792 --> 01:27:24,558
All the signs
of a psycho killer were th...

1341
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,027
Hello?

1342
01:27:26,029 --> 01:27:27,628
I'm trying to
get interviewed here.

1343
01:27:28,965 --> 01:27:30,965
Oh, my God,
she is such a tool.

1344
01:27:30,967 --> 01:27:34,835
Anyhoo... Lori's little plot
was super lame.

1345
01:27:34,837 --> 01:27:36,804
Poisoning a cupcake?
Really?

1346
01:27:36,806 --> 01:27:38,005
We're Kappas.

1347
01:27:38,007 --> 01:27:39,840
We don't eat cupcakes.

1348
01:27:39,842 --> 01:27:41,709

1352

Dad, no, Dad, I'm fine.

- Yeah.

1355
01:27:50,787 --> 01:27:52,219
I'm just a little scratched up.

1356
01:27:52,221 --> 01:27:53,353
All right.

1357
01:27:53,355 --> 01:27:55,723
Okay.
I'll see you soon.

- I love you, too. Bye.

1359
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:01,228
So, uh, now that your...

1360
01:28:01,230 --> 01:28:03,898
bedroom is officially
a crime scene and all,

1361
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:06,270
uh, where you planning on
crashing tonight?

1362
01:28:07,703 --> 01:28:10,705
Is that an invitation?

1363
01:28:10,707 --> 01:28:13,674
You sure you want to wake up
in a dorm room again?

1364
01:28:13,676 --> 01:28:16,810
Only if it's yours.

1365
01:28:16,812 --> 01:28:18,778
Well, I mean, of course,

1366
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:20,747
you'll have to
sleep in Ryan's bed.

1367
01:28:20,749 --> 01:28:22,883
- Of course.
- Yeah.

1368
01:28:22,885 --> 01:28:25,685
We can, yeah...

1369
01:28:26,823 --> 01:28:27,854
Oh, uh...

1370
01:28:27,856 --> 01:28:30,890
almost forgot.

1371
01:28:30,892 --> 01:28:32,729
You left this little guy.

1372
01:28:36,999 --> 01:28:39,399
Thanks.

1373
01:28:39,401 --> 01:28:41,768

scenario reminds me of?

1374
01:28:41,770 --> 01:28:42,836
What?

1375
01:28:42,838 --> 01:28:43,903
- Uh...
- What's that?

01:28:48,977 --> 01:28:50,678
Who's Bill Murray?

1381
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:52,713
