1
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,481
<i>You'll float, too!</i>

2
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,070
<i>You'll float, too!</i>

3
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,030
<i>You'll float, too!</i>

4
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,699
I saw all of us.

5
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,664
All of us were there.

6
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,504
Back in the cistern.

7
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,754
But we were older.

8
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,215
We were our parents' ages.

9
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,713
Am I still handsome as an adult?

10
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,765
You grow into your looks.

11
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:01,638
What the fuck does that mean?

12
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,221
What about me?

13
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,311
Like now...

14
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,604
but taller.

15
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:19,412
Swear it.

16
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:23,827
Swear if It isn't dead...

17
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,084
if It ever comes back...

18
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,248
we'll come back, too.

19
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,258
<i>Memory...</i>

20
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:37,967
<i>it's a funny thing.</i>

21
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,885
<i>People want to believe they are
what they choose to remember.</i>

22
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:46,892
<i>The good stuff.</i>

23
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,561
<i>The moments.</i>

24
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,231
<i>The places.</i>

25
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,149
<i>The people we all hold on to.</i>

26
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,038
<i>But sometimes...</i>

27
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,036
<i>...sometimes...</i>

28
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,750
<i>we are what we wish we could forget.</i>

29
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:34,779
Okay, kids.

30
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,321
Get ready.

31
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:38,902
Go!

32
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,906
Who's it gonna be? First one to pop
their balloon's a winner!

33
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,224
It could be anyone!
We got a real barn burner here, folks.

34
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,284
Come on. Come on.

35
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,491
It's getting close.

36
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:51,085
Who's gonna catch the leader, huh?

37
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,580
Who's gonna be the big winner tonight?

38
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:54,831
- Oh, yeah!
- Whoo!

39
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,633
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

40
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,172
- Thank you.
- Wow.

41
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,715
You really showed 'em, huh?

42
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,088
I did. I...

43
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,135
Yeah.

44
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,678
Hey, girl, do you want this?

45
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,169
Thanks for letting me win.

46
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,310
Yeah.

47
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,755
- What'd you get, Vicky?
- Aw. Such a gentleman.

48
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,111
Look at that!

49
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,527
Here is your consolation prize.

50
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,403
Look at that.

51
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,027
Never been a fan of the beaver...

52
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,996
but, um, look at this hat.
I mean...

53
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:28,999
Thank you.

54
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:34,246
So, we need to talk logistics.

55
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,543
Ooh. How romantic.

56
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,211
Romantic?

57
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,127
What's so fucking romantic, huh?

58
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,464
Hey.

59
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,829
Your mommas ever teach you boys
to respond to someone...

60
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,333
when they ask you a fucking question?

61
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,349
Come on, Adrian.

62
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,560
You got a problem, faggot?

63
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,779
I don't, but Meg Ryan called.

64
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,568
She wants her wig back.

65
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:03,364
All right. All right.

66
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,114
Come on.
Come on, Adrian.

67
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,917
Stuff like that is why
I have to leave this shithole town.

68
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,080
Small minds.

69
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,248
They have small dicks.

70
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,587
I'm being serious.

71
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,081
We belong elsewhere.

72
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,736
Hey, look,
if you end up hating New York...

73
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,127
we can always move back here.

74
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,656
I just want to be with you.

75
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,672
I don't care. New York, Derry, whatever.

76
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,343
You have to say that.

77
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:28,636
I don't have to say anything.

78
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,719
Take off that fucking hat.

79
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,641
- Oh, God.
- Come on, let's go.

80
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,083
Wouldn't want to give people
the impression...

81
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,169
we allow a bunch of fucking fairies
like you in this town.

82
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,729
Yeah, he was born here, asshole.

83
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,069
- All right, let's go.
- No. You know what?

84
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:41,883
I'll take off the hat for you.

85
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,569
But why leave it there?

86
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,488
Anything else you would like me
to take off for you tonight?

87
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,871
Any special requests, ladies?

88
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:52,994
Fucker!

89
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,617
Let him go!

90
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:03,761
What's that?

91
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,719
- Stop.
- I don't think you'll be needing that.

92
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,218
- Leave him alone!
- Hit him.

93
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,137
He's got asthma, fucker!

94
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,442
Come on!

95
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,568
Fuck him up!

96
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:21,735
Come on, kick him!

97
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,904
- Come on, kick the shit out of him.
- Adrian!

98
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,162
I still hate your fucking hair.

99
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,875
Adrian!

100
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,287
Get the fuck off him!

101
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,831
Look what you did to his fucking face!

102
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,381
Hey! Hey! Help me get him up.

103
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,844
Adrian.

104
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:49,305
Help me get this fucking punk up
right now.

105
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,479
Give me the hat, Chris.

106
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:58,897
It's fucking mine!

107
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,516
I said, give me the fucking hat!

108
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,103
Adrian!

109
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,693
You like that?

110
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,657
Welcome to Derry, motherfucker.

111
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,074
No! Adrian!

112
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,696
No!

113
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,282
Let's get the fuck out of here.

114
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,335
- Let's go!
- No!

115
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:26,918
Adrian!

116
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,052
Help!

117
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,089
Help me!

118
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,387
Somebody!

119
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,102
Somebody fucking help me!

120
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,289
Adrian.

121
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,299
No!

122
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,176
Adrian!

123
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,237
<i>We all float down here!</i>

124
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,192
<i>Thing is...</i>

125
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,620
<i>sometimes what we wish was forgotten...</i>

126
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,624
<i>what we tried to leave in the past...</i>

127
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,832
<i>...won't stay there.</i>

128
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,610
<i>Units, please respond.</i>

129
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,172
<i>I'm getting reports of a body
found dismembered.</i>

130
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,511
<i>Come back.
Was that "dismembered"?</i>

131
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,783
<i>That's affirmative.</i>

132
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,265
<i>Scene is near the south entrance
of the festival grounds.</i>

133
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,929
<i>Copy that. En route.</i>

134
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,269
<i>- Any directive for TC?
- That's affirmative.</i>

135
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,231
<i>Chief said to tape off
the Derry Street Bridge.</i>

136
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,066
<i>Sometimes, it comes back for you.</i>

137
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,227
Ah.

138
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,179
Mr. Denbrough? They need you on set.

139
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,651
Good?

140
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,820
We're just going to go this way.

141
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,802
- I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
- No, don't!

142
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,362
Hey! Clear the door!

143
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,722
Oh, come on.
You've never seen <i>Indiana Jones?</i>

144
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,533
Watch your back.

145
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,996
Hey, hey. You a crewmember?

146
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,911
I'm the writer.

147
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,960
Your husband's here.

148
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,553
Hey! Do you have the pages?

149
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,721
Everyone, clear the crane.

150
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,763
My friend, a film needs an ending.

151
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,269
- You do know that, right?
- Oh, yeah.

152
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,435
You said that you needed another day
to finish the pages...

153
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,878
and we're shooting this thing.
It's tonight.

154
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:11,902
That's, like, 17 hours...

155
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,108
Everybody, calm down, okay?

156
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,190
I'm calm.

157
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,154
I want you to be happy with the movie.

158
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,614
You understand? I'm on your side.

159
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,734
That's great.
'Cause in my book, the ending...

160
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,905
Is terrible.

161
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,995
All due respect,
people loved your book. Loved.

162
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,331
They hated the ending.

163
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,374
You said you liked the ending.

164
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:28,663
That was a lie.

165
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,246
- We gotta do better, okay?
- Yeah.

166
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,873
Audra, you have my notes.
Would you...

167
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,671
Okay, thank you very much.
Take me back to one, please.

168
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,336
Bye.

169
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,428
You have his notes?

170
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,093
He's not wrong.

171
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,640
You hate my endings, too?

172
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,684
Not all your endings.

173
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:46,848
But this...

174
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,221
- Okay.
- Just...

175
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,352
What? Do you want me
to keep lying to you...

176
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,324
- just because I'm your wife?
- You're my wife?

177
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,935
No. No. But, you know, what?

178
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,049
You've been blowing smoke up my ass
for eight years?

179
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,467
I guess I thought you were someone else.

180
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,199
I have not been blowing
smoke up your ass.

181
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,695
Everybody wants a happy ending.
Everybody wants closure.

182
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,538
But that's not the way life works out.

183
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,783
I think what Peter wants
and what the studio wants...

184
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,160
The studio?
When'd you become a company man?

185
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,832
Jesus, you're an artist.

186
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,859
Come on. What's wrong with just doing it
the way it's written?

187
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:15,919
The way I wanted.

188
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,050
What's wrong with being the woman
I want you to be?

189
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,801
Fuck you, Bill.

190
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,797
On the page. The part, I mean. Not you.

191
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,142
Hello?

192
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,766
<i>Bill Denbrough? It's Mike.</i>

193
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:34,938
Mike who?

194
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,353
Mike Hanlon.

195
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,322
<i>From Derry.</i>

196
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,580
You need to come home.

197
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,836
<i>Eddie, I keep
telling you not to scare me like this.</i>

198
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,584
<i>- And you never listen to me.</i>
- All right. Myra, please. Not now.

199
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,211
You shouldn't be out there.

200
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,657
Eddie, it's not safe to drive
when the roads are slick like this.

201
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,828
Sweetheart, it stopped raining, like,
three hours ago.

202
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,371
All right? Everything is gonna be fine.

203
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,435
Hey, dickhead!
Flow of traffic mean anything to you?

204
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,763
What if you hydroplane?

205
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,481
I'm not gonna hydroplane.

206
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,441
It is my job to assess risk.

207
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,105
So, please trust me when I tell you...

208
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:21,091
that, statistically speaking, I am much
more likely to get into an accident...

209
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,232
because I am talking to you
on the phone!

210
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:26,532
All right? I have to go.
I will talk to you soon. Goodbye.

211
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,197
Edward Kaspbrak speaking.

212
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,811
<i>You didn't say, "Okay, bye,
I love you," like you usually do.</i>

213
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,063
Listen to me. I can't!

214
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,327
I'm going to be late to this...

215
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,589
...meeting.

216
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,831
<i>Say "I love you," Eddie.</i>

217
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,299
Okay, I love you, Mommy.

218
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:41,927
What?

219
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,553
Myra.

220
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,554
Bye.

221
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,089
Hello? Who's this?

222
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:48,557
<i>It's me. Mike.</i>

223
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,426
Mike who?

224
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,187
<i>Eddie! You okay?</i>

225
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,851
Yeah, I'm pretty good.

226
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:05,198
Dude, what the fuck?
You were fine, like, five seconds ago.

227
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,942
Who was it? Who called? Huh?

228
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,487
Rich? Rich? Talk to me.

229
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,580
You're on in two minutes.
You good?

230
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,370
'Cause you look not good.

231
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,826
- I'm fine.
- You're fine? Okay.

232
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,211
And we're walking. We're walking.

233
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,455
Sixty seconds.

234
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,590
Even faster. All right.

235
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,233
Can you get him
a bottle of water, maybe?

236
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,134
- Bourbon.
- Bourbon. Sure, sure.

237
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,262
And a mint.

238
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,844
It is showtime.

239
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,464
I don't think I can do this.

240
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,660
- It's what you do. You kill.
- That was fast.

241
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,720
You're a killer.

242
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,600
Okay. We are good to go, and...

243
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:33,998
Hey! Where we going? Where we going?

244
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,354
This way. Attaboy.

245
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,597
Okay.

246
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,524
All right. How do I look?

247
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,314
Your hands are shaking, Rich.

248
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,778
Shit.

249
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:47,070
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Richie Tozier!</i>

250
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,491
All right. How are we doing tonight?

251
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:02,506
So, my girlfriend caught me masturbating
to her friend's Facebook page.

252
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,978
And, uh, so now I'm in
Masturbators Anonymous.

253
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,491
And I stand up at the first meeting...

254
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,883
and I say,
"My name is Richie Trashmouth."

255
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,899
- <i>Trashmouth.
- Shut up, Richie.</i>

256
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,790
- <i>Fucking perv.
- Shut up, Richie.</i>

257
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:17,895
<i>Pussy!</i>

258
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,686
Trashmouth. Uh...

259
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,985
Forgot the joke.

260
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,150
You suck!

261
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,848
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
for letting us present to you today.

262
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,741
Now, this will include
over a million square feet...

263
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,914
of commercial and residential space.

264
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,708
State-of-the-art office towers.

265
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,001
What I'm really looking for
is to understand...

266
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,383
how we create
even more retail opportunities.

267
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:50,384
If we put in walls here
and all along here...

268
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:51,801
<i>Lose them.</i>

269
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,218
<i>With all due respect, Mr. Hanscom...</i>

270
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,688
Ben, please.
And with all due respect to you...

271
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:03,105
I'm getting claustrophobic
just looking at this model. Aren't you?

272
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:07,279
Look. Throw up more walls,
it's gonna feel like a prison.

273
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,842
You know what people want to do
in prison?

274
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,448
Get out. Right?

275
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,615
This should be a place
that brings people together.

276
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,529
A meeting ground.

277
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,663
A clubhouse.

278
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,043
And if, while people are there...

279
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:34,590
<i>Excuse me for one second.</i>

280
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:41,931
- Hello?
<i>- Ben?</i>

281
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:45,275
<i>It's Mike Hanlon. From Derry.</i>

282
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,453
Should I just book it?

283
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,691
You're sure you can get away from work?

284
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,210
It's summer, why not?

285
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,714
Okay, we are Buenos Aires-bound.

286
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,479
Stanley Uris speaking.

287
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,107
It's Mike.

288
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:31,696
I'm sorry?

289
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,190
<i>Mike Hanlon.</i>

290
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,367
<i>From Derry.</i>

291
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,821
Mike.

292
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,285
God, sorry. Yes, hi.

293
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,788
I don't know why I didn't, um...

294
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,588
How long's it been?

295
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,173
A long time.

296
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,255
<i>27 years.</i>

297
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,892
It's come back, hasn't it?

298
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,186
<i>That's why you're calling me?</i>

299
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,021
It's starting again, Stan.

300
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,432
<i>Bad things are happening.</i>

301
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:10,774
Did you call the others?
I mean, what if they don't come?

302
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,817
We made a promise, remember?

303
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,323
<i>How soon can you get here?</i>

304
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:16,988
Um...

305
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,828
Yeah, I would need to do a few things...

306
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,539
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

307
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,995
<i>We don't have much time.</i>

308
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,573
<i>I'll text you everything you need.</i>

309
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,870
I'll see you soon, Stan the Man.

310
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:10,416
Do you swear?

311
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,929
I swear, Bill.

312
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,853
<i>You made a promise, Beverly.</i>

313
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,688
I'm so sorry, Mike.

314
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,149
I don't even really remember.

315
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:14,527
Haven't you ever wondered...

316
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,008
why you can't seem to remember
the things most people should...

317
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:21,199
<i>about where they're from,
about who they are...</i>

318
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,034
<i>why you have that scar on your hand?</i>

319
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,785
<i>No one else remembered, either.</i>

320
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:31,619
<i>Eddie, Ben, Stan, Richie...</i>

321
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:32,754
<i>Bill.</i>

322
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,166
Bill.

323
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,919
You have to come back.

324
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:39,714
You all do.

325
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,213
When?

326
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,031
Whoa. Are you okay? What's going on?

327
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,199
It's the middle of the night.
You're packing?

328
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,821
I didn't want to wake you, honey.

329
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,370
I know this week's been
really exhausting.

330
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:14,165
I just got a phone call
from an old friend from Derry.

331
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,922
I have to go back there.

332
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,550
It's really hard to explain why.

333
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:21,714
It's okay.

334
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,302
You don't have to
explain yourself to me. Relax.

335
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,383
I trust you.

336
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,805
Thank you.

337
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:36,983
I just don't understand
why you'd lie to me.

338
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:42,815
I heard you.

339
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,860
You said the name Mike.

340
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,531
Yes, my friend.

341
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,370
See, there was a group of us
back then...

342
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,785
and we all made a promise to each other
when we were kids.

343
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,751
You know trust is everything
in a relationship.

344
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,792
You know it's everything to me, right?

345
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:00,044
I know. This isn't...

346
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,167
What? Like the last time?

347
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,965
I never cheated on you.

348
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,804
You're a bad fucking liar, Bev.

349
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,015
You're not going anywhere, okay?

350
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,927
I want you to stay right here...

351
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,770
and you're gonna show me
what it is you're gonna do with Mike.

352
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:15,857
Okay?

353
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,315
You're hurting me, honey.

354
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,569
No one else is gonna love you like me.
You know that, right?

355
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:23,939
I'm sorry.

356
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,138
- Don't make this fucking harder!
- Don't.

357
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,105
You're nothing without me!
You know that, right?

358
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,361
Tell me I'm wrong!

359
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,349
Jesus Christ.

360
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:20,809
Boys.

361
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,399
Little prick's got balls,
I'll give him that.

362
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,022
Far enough, Bowers!

363
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,395
I'm not done yet.

364
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,941
I'm not done. I'm not fucking done.

365
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,217
- On your knees.
- I can't. No!

366
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,607
I gotta kill them all!
Fuck, fuck!

367
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,026
Fucking kill them all!
Stop it!

368
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,412
- Cuff this sorry sack of shit!
- Fuck you!

369
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,368
Fuck you!

370
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,741
Henry Bowers,
I am placing you under arrest...

371
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,455
for the murder of Oscar Bowers.

372
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,579
Do you understand, dipshit?

373
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,581
You have the right to an attorney.

374
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,629
You have the right to remain silent.

375
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,050
Bowers!

376
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:38,258
Bowers, calm the fuck down!

377
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,815
Someone needs a little extra
clozapine today, don't they?

378
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:53,194
Stay in your fucking room.

379
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,050
Hockstetter.

380
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,598
My knife.

381
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,532
- Whoa.
- Careful.

382
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,025
This way.

383
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,652
Thanks a lot.

384
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,539
- Hey.
- Oh...

385
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,334
- Mike, you look good. Oh.
- Bill.

386
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:29,828
Hey. How you doing?

387
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:31,714
Bill.

388
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,152
I didn't know if any of you would...

389
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:35,361
- I mean, after all this time...
- Yeah.

390
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:36,385
But of course you came.

391
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,503
You know, an oath is an oath.

392
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,380
Losers...

393
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,719
gotta stick together, right?

394
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,391
The Losers.

395
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,762
You remember that. That's good.

396
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,147
What else do you remember?

397
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:53,105
I am allergic to soy,
anything that has egg in it, gluten...

398
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:56,947
and if I eat a cashew,
I could realistically die.

399
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,904
Holy shit.

400
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,041
Is there a password or something?

401
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:20,888
I'm sorry.

402
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:23,343
The new kid.

403
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,560
Ben?

404
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,392
Yeah.

405
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,642
Oh, my God.

406
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:31,810
Oh, my God.

407
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,063
It's been so long.

408
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,235
<i>Stay cool, Ben from soc class.</i>

409
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,567
<i>You, too, Beverly.</i>

410
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,872
<i>Hang tough,
new kid on the block.</i>

411
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:46,450
Wow.

412
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,283
You two look amazing.

413
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,410
What the fuck happened to me?

414
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,274
- What's going on, man?
- Hey, man.

415
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:56,130
- It's Richie. Hi.
- Yeah. It's Ben.

416
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,292
- Hi.
- Hey.

417
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,180
This meeting of the Losers' Club
has officially begun.

418
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:05,515
Look at these guys.

419
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:09,935
Ben.

420
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,189
So, wait, Eddie, you got married?

421
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:19,674
Yeah, why's that
so fucking funny, dickwad?

422
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,859
What? To, like, a woman?

423
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,561
Fuck you, bro.

424
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:23,987
Fuck you!

425
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,679
What about you, Trashmouth?
You married?

426
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,658
There's no way Richie's married.

427
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:28,870
No, I got married.

428
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:30,518
- Richie, I don't believe it.
- When?

429
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,895
- Did you not hear this?
- No.

430
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,229
- You didn't know I got married?
- No.

431
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,246
Yeah, no. Me and your mom
are very, very happy right now.

432
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,942
Yeah, very happy.

433
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,166
He totally fell for it!

434
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:41,505
Fuck you.

435
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:44,380
She's very sweet. Sometimes, she'll put
her arm around me...

436
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,597
and she'll whisper to me, she'll go...

437
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,179
We all get it.
My mom was a great, big, fat person.

438
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:55,936
Hilarious. Hysterical.

439
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,397
Yeah, it's a nice watch.

440
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,862
Wait, let's talk about the elephant
not in the room...

441
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,106
Ben.

442
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:04,403
What the fuck, man?

443
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,696
Okay, okay.
Obviously, I lost a few pounds.

444
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,556
- Lost a few pounds?
- Yeah, no shit, you lost a few pounds.

445
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,821
You're hot!

446
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:11,118
That's true.

447
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,937
No, you're like every Brazilian soccer
player wrapped up into one person.

448
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:16,203
Leave him alone.
You're embarrassing him.

449
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,045
Okay, okay, all right. Please, come on.

450
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,789
Is Stanley coming or what?

451
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,257
Someone save me.

452
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:24,631
Stan.

453
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,134
Stan, uh...

454
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,632
Stan Uris. Stan Urine.

455
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,185
Stanley Urine.
No, no, he's a fucking pussy.

456
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,393
He's not gonna show.

457
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,229
Why would Stanley save you, anyway?

458
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:38,141
Was I not the one who basically
performed surgery on you...

459
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:39,688
- after Bowers cut you up?
- Yes!

460
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,856
Holy shit! That's right.

461
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,988
Please tell me you ended up
becoming a doctor, Eds.

462
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,490
No, I ended up becoming
a risk analyst.

463
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,762
Oh, that sounds
really interesting.

464
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,072
What does that entail?

465
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:52,197
Yeah, so I work
for a big insurance firm and...

466
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,586
Fuck you, dude. Fuck you.

467
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,584
Was this job invented before fun?

468
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:07,174
- Oh, that's so not funny.
- It is funny.

469
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:10,135
What the fuck are you laughing at?

470
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,346
I propose a toast...

471
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,348
to the Losers.

472
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,102
Let's take our shirts off
and kiss!

473
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:31,931
- Oh, here we go.
- Thank you.

474
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,537
Thank you.

475
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,624
Like, Rogan-Marsh,
half my wife's closet Rogan-Marsh?

476
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,334
That's huge.

477
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,917
That's our line.
Me and my husband, Tom.

478
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,484
How long have you been married?

479
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,090
Hey, we saw your movie...

480
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,459
- by the way.
- You did?

481
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,072
- Oh, my God! It was so good.
- Oh, my God.

482
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,758
It was so scary.

483
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,134
And the ending sucked?

484
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,222
Yeah, it did. I'm sorry.

485
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,515
That's all right.

486
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,650
What?

487
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,190
Nothing. This is just weird.

488
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:06,403
Yeah.

489
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,988
Just all this, all these memories...

490
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:11,322
people that I don't even
remember forgetting.

491
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:15,199
I mean, it's weird, right?

492
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,786
Now that we're all here...

493
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:20,535
everything just comes back
faster and faster.

494
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,706
I mean, all of it.

495
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,006
Yeah.

496
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,012
Yeah, you know, when Mike called me,
I threw up.

497
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,797
Isn't that weird?
Like, I got nervous.

498
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:30,340
I got, like, sick and I threw up.

499
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,050
I feel fine now. I feel very relieved
to be here with you guys.

500
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,285
Why is everybody looking at me
like this?

501
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,058
When Mike called me, I crashed my car.

502
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,225
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

503
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:41,643
Shit, man, I hear you.

504
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:45,314
I mean, my heart was literally
pounding right out of my chest.

505
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,688
- I thought it was only me.
- It was like pure...

506
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,278
Fear.

507
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:56,245
It's fear. What you felt.

508
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:58,706
Why did we all feel like that, Mike?

509
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,078
You remember something we don't,
don't you, Mike?

510
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,918
Something happens to you
when you leave this town.

511
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,542
The farther away,
the hazier it all gets.

512
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,470
But me, I never left.

513
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:14,682
So, yeah.

514
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:17,387
I remember.

515
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,807
I remember all of it.

516
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:25,234
Pennywise.

517
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,403
Oh, the fucking clown.

518
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,230
- Oh, shit.
- Pennywise.

519
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,469
Mike, you said you wanted our help
with something.

520
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,904
What was that?

521
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:38,488
There's an echo here in Derry
that bounces back every 27 years.

522
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,600
What are you talking about?

523
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,160
Hold on. Listen, listen.

524
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,041
We thought we stopped It back then.

525
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,622
We thought It was done, but...

526
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:47,298
Mike.

527
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:50,796
A week ago, a man,
Adrian Mellon, slaughtered.

528
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:53,507
A girl, Lisa Albrecht, the other night,
went missing.

529
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:54,716
All right.

530
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,847
There've already been others
and there will be more.

531
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:58,161
I don't want to hear
about this shit.

532
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:00,518
- More death. More pain.
- Calm down.

533
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:01,598
Let's get another drink.

534
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,137
Let him explain. Let him explain.

535
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,681
Explain it to us, Mike.

536
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,269
That echo...

537
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,268
we might have changed It...

538
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,687
just like It changed us.

539
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,605
But we didn't stop It.

540
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,569
Because It just bounced back.

541
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,072
We made an oath.

542
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:22,540
That's why I brought you back.
That's why you're here.

543
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,325
To finish It.

544
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,788
For good.

545
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,664
Well, that shit got dark fast.

546
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,258
Thanks, Mike.

547
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,054
My fortune cookie just says "Could."

548
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,328
They don't know how to do
fortune cookies here.

549
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,513
Mine just says "Guess."

550
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,268
You wanna throw that over here?

551
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,315
What you got, Mikey?

552
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,115
Wait, what?

553
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,324
This is what I'm talking about.

554
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,611
"Guess. Cut. Not. Could. It."

555
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:01,120
It's a message.

556
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,030
No, "Guess it could not cut."

557
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,370
Why would it guess it could not cut?

558
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:08,001
- Cut what?
- "Guess it could not cut."

559
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,787
"It" goes in front. There.

560
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,000
"It could not guess."

561
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,507
- It couldn't guess.
- "Could it..."

562
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:14,793
No. "Could it not cut."

563
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,322
When it says "It,"
is it talking about It?

564
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:18,633
- Yeah. All right.
- Is that what it means? Is "It" It?

565
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:19,718
Where does this go?

566
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,577
- That's what I'm talking about.
- It... It could...

567
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,703
I don't know
what it fucking means!

568
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,288
You fuck with the fortune cookies, Mike?

569
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,312
No.

570
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:26,436
Let him speak, man.

571
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,848
This is not me.
This is what It does.

572
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,002
I need my fucking inhaler!

573
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,879
What is wrong with you, man?
Why'd you call us?

574
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,422
- This is so not funny!
- This is not fucking funny!

575
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,153
- Beverly?
- This is so not funny.

576
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,258
Why does it say Stanley?

577
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:09,271
Someone else fucking answer me!

578
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:12,145
Holy shit.

579
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,811
Holy shit.

580
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,824
What the fuck is that, man?

581
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,614
Oh, my God.

582
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:30,961
Whoa, whoa!

583
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,332
Whoa!

584
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:41,678
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

585
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:43,932
Shit.

586
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:46,971
Hey!

587
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,886
That fortune cookie's looking at me!

588
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:49,938
Shit!

589
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:55,310
I don't want to be here.
I can't fucking do this.

590
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:56,978
I wanna go home!
I don't wanna be here!

591
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:01,367
Holy shit!

592
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,527
Hey! God damn it.

593
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,325
Eddie!

594
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,061
Fuck!

595
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,348
It's not real!

596
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,556
This isn't real!
It's not real!

597
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:39,314
It's not real! It's not real!

598
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:42,023
It's not real! It's not real!

599
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,309
Is everything all right?

600
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,571
Yeah. Could we get the check?

601
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:55,790
That's what Pennywise does, right?

602
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,705
He fucks with us.
So, Stanley's probably fine.

603
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,151
Hey, Mike. Do you have Stan's number?

604
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,632
Yeah.

605
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:01,918
Hey, Richie.

606
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,381
How'd you know my name?

607
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,141
The fun's just beginning.

608
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:11,226
Right?

609
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:17,441
What he said, is it...

610
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,560
Listen. You think this is funny?

611
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,853
All right?

612
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,318
Think this is some sort of game, huh?

613
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,777
Well, fuck you, all right?

614
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:25,970
Rich, be careful, dude.

615
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,735
Fuck you! I'm not afraid of you!

616
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:30,700
"The fun's just beginning."

617
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,866
The line from your act, dude.
I'm a fan.

618
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,580
- Are those your parents?
- Yeah.

619
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,170
You want a picture?

620
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,627
- You okay, Dean? Come on.
- I think I'm good.

621
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,917
Okay, cool.
He's a good kid.

622
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,758
Jesus, Richie. You don't remember a line
from your own show?

623
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,923
I don't write my own material.

624
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:51,012
I fucking knew it!
I fucking knew it!

625
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:55,938
Hello, Mrs. Uris.
My name's Beverly Marsh.

626
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:59,100
I apologize for calling,
but I'm an old friend of your husband's.

627
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:00,814
You lied to us. That's not okay.

628
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,256
Yeah, first words out of your mouth
should have been like...

629
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,693
"Hey, man. You want to come to Derry
and get murdered?"

630
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,152
'Cause then I would have said no.

631
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,117
Guys.

632
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,529
Fucking entrapment, man.

633
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:09,823
<i>Oh...</i>

634
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:13,330
<i>He passed.</i>

635
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,578
When did it happen?

636
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,042
<i>Yesterday.</i>

637
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,838
<i>It was horrible, the way he died.</i>

638
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:24,550
<i>His wrists.</i>

639
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:26,756
- In the bathtub.
<i>- In the bathtub.</i>

640
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,890
<i>I'm sorry. I have to go.</i>

641
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,219
We're all very sorry, Patty.

642
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,387
<i>Thank you.</i>

643
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,068
Stanley.

644
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,979
Pennywise knew. He knew before we did.

645
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,613
We have to stop him.
I have a plan.

646
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,427
I got a plan.
Getting the fuck out of Dodge...

647
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,568
before this ends worse
than one of Bill's books.

648
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,656
Who's with me?

649
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:53,307
We made a promise to each other.

650
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,243
Let's un-make the promise.

651
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,702
Richie, other people are gonna die.

652
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,788
Other people die every day, man!

653
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,544
We don't owe this town shit!

654
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,456
Plus, I just remembered I grew up here,
like, two hours ago.

655
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:06,296
So, I'm fucking leaving. Fuck this.

656
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,336
I'm sorry, man, I'm with Richie.

657
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,213
- Eds, please.
- Listen.

658
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,632
What? We stay, we die, that's it?

659
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,638
I'm gonna go back to the inn,
I'm gonna pack up my shit...

660
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,178
and I'm gonna drive to my home.

661
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,562
I'm sorry, man. Good luck.

662
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,222
No, Eddie. Please.
Please, Eddie!

663
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:21,607
Eddie, wait!

664
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:25,815
You okay?

665
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,635
I'm gonna head back
to the Town House, too.

666
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,116
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.

667
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:34,783
You should have told us, Mikey.

668
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,163
Bill. Please, man.

669
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,616
I'm begging you. Please.

670
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,159
Just listen to me, man. Please.

671
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,622
What are you gonna say?

672
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:46,068
What could you possibly say that
would make any kind of a difference?

673
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,333
They're all gone.

674
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,711
Come on. Let me show you something.

675
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:54,256
One thing. And if you want to leave,
you can leave.

676
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:55,909
Just let me show you this first. Please.

677
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:05,150
Lapskew!
What kind of name is that, huh?

678
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,685
My mom swings better than you!

679
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:07,840
How many times do I have to...

680
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:10,777
She doesn't even play baseball!
You suck!

681
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:16,867
Mommy, how much longer?

682
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:21,250
Victoria, we came to watch the game.
We're gonna watch the game.

683
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,885
Hello, Vicky.

684
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,351
Isn't that what your friends call you?

685
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,400
Vicky?

686
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,146
How did I know that?

687
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:32,654
I guess I must be
your friend, too.

688
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,945
If you're my friend,
why are you hiding in the dark?

689
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,912
You're not my friend.
You're scary.

690
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,631
Why are you crying?

691
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:57,380
People always make fun
'cause of the way I look.

692
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,218
I thought if you couldn't see my face...

693
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:05,976
then maybe you'd want to be my friend.

694
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,557
Oh. Never mind.

695
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:14,731
Oh, silly old Pennywise,
you'll never have no friends.

696
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,364
People make fun of me, too.

697
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,193
They do?

698
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:22,329
'Cause of this.

699
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,824
Well, isn't that silly?

700
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:28,744
That little thing?

701
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,751
Why, I can blow that thing right away.

702
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,295
You could?

703
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,459
Oh, yes!

704
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,420
One poof and it'd be gone!

705
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:45,052
You would have to get close enough
to see my face.

706
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,388
I don't know, Vicky.

707
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,978
No, it's okay. I won't make fun.
I promise.

708
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:53,022
Promise, promise?

709
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:56,567
Well, okie-dokie!

710
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:58,403
Just come on in a little closer

711
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,943
and we'll blow it away
on the count of three!

712
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:05,785
One...

713
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:10,498
two...

714
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,056
You're supposed to say three.

715
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,252
Holy fuck.

716
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,178
Boo!

717
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,395
Fuck yeah!

718
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,649
Hey, Hockstetter.

719
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:21,274
Let's go!

720
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:41,134
Let's get our shit
and get the fuck out of here.

721
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,420
Did you leave your stuff here?

722
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:43,751
No, my stuff's still in the car.

723
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:00,688
- Tell me.
- Tell you what?

724
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,028
Whatever it is you're afraid
to tell me right now.

725
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:09,456
Bev. Bev.

726
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:11,351
Back at the Jade when you were
on the phone with Stanley's...

727
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,375
Stop.

728
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,916
She told you that she found him
in the bathtub...

729
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,047
but, Bev, I saw you.

730
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,003
I heard it. You said it first.

731
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:23,739
Whatever you guys are talking about...

732
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:25,846
let's make it happen faster, all right?
We gotta go.

733
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,098
<i>Eduardo, ándale!</i> Let's go!

734
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,929
There's something you're not telling us.

735
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:33,012
You knew how Stanley died.
You knew.

736
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,440
Wait, what?

737
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,683
I can't do this.

738
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:41,899
She knew how Stanley was going to die,
is that what she just said?

739
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:44,031
You can't just walk away from this.

740
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,816
How did you know
where he killed himself?

741
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:47,869
Bev.

742
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:49,907
Talk to me.

743
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:51,572
Just talk to me.
Like we used to.

744
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:53,160
Come on, how did you know?

745
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:55,788
Because I saw it.

746
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,329
I've seen all of us die.

747
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,625
Okay, I just got to grab my toiletry bag
and then we can go.

748
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:07,222
What'd I miss?

749
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:22,273
The library?

750
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:24,358
Mmm-hmm.

751
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:27,820
Wow.

752
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:30,152
Didn't this place used to be bigger?

753
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:44,708
Yo!
Mike, where are you going?

754
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:12,991
Mike, you live... live here?

755
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:14,826
Yeah. Make yourself at home.

756
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,787
- You want some water?
- Yeah, sure.

757
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,182
You see, memory's the thing.

758
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,592
It's the key.

759
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:36,760
It's the key to everything.

760
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:40,897
If It really does
want us back here...

761
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,502
don't you think
the smartest thing we can do

762
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,754
is just get the hell out of Derry?

763
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,236
No, no, no. It does want us back.

764
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,361
Of course It does!

765
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:50,240
- But It doesn't know I know what I know.
- What do you know?

766
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,524
How to kill the shit out of It!

767
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:54,119
I've read every book.

768
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:57,122
I've talked to every person
in this godforsaken town,

769
00:47:57,166 --> 00:48:00,455
everybody that would talk to me, anyway,
and that's not a long list.

770
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:03,962
But it wasn't enough.
I had to know how this all started.

771
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,086
How It started.

772
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:13,263
And It started...

773
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:16,810
here.

774
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:17,936
Whoa.

775
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:21,055
- What am I looking at, Mike?
- It's an artifact.

776
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,894
Early 18th century Shokopiwah.

777
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:26,522
How'd you get it?

778
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,566
I found it, in the...

779
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,150
No, no, they gave it to me.

780
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,075
I stole it.

781
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,988
You stole it?

782
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,198
- From Native Americans?
- Uh...

783
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,454
- It's complicated.
- Yeah, it is.

784
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,078
They helped me on my journey.

785
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:42,455
So beautiful.

786
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,628
They showed me things. A vision.

787
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:47,132
Ow.

788
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,336
Holy fuck.

789
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:51,342
I feel kind of funky.

790
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:52,303
Hot.

791
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:53,840
Am I sweating?

792
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:57,178
I need you to see
what they showed me, Bill.

793
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,353
They live outside of Derry.

794
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,559
<i>Beyond It's reach.</i>

795
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,066
<i>They moved there many years ago.</i>

796
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:09,611
<i>Their holy man...</i>

797
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:11,696
<i>their holy of holies...</i>

798
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:14,695
<i>he took me in.</i>

799
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:18,620
<i>Fed me their sacred Maturin.</i>

800
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,657
<i>I started to... to react.</i>

801
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:25,077
All living things
must abide by the laws...

802
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,204
of the shape they inhabit.

803
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,057
<i>While I sat there,
looking out over the valley...</i>

804
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:37,385
<i>I saw It arrive.</i>

805
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:45,514
I knew that one day,
I would have to make you all see.

806
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:46,566
Mike...

807
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:50,443
did you put something in my drink?

808
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:54,824
It's a root.

809
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:59,365
- You drugged me?
- No, it's a root with properties.

810
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,516
It's just a micro-dose
of what the Shokopiwah gave me...

811
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,576
Why would you do that?

812
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:04,537
...to open my eyes.

813
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:06,292
I don't feel real good.

814
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:08,545
I need you to look...

815
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:10,715
and you'll see.

816
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,499
I don't feel good.

817
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:13,758
Open your eyes.

818
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:15,512
Open your eyes.

819
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:16,920
<i>They showed me the past.</i>

820
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:26,855
<i>Showed me the way It appeared to them.</i>

821
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:41,364
<i>They showed me their pain.</i>

822
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:46,992
<i>They showed me how to stop It!</i>

823
00:50:58,347 --> 00:50:59,347
It's over.

824
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:00,805
It's over. You're okay.

825
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:03,216
You're okay. Did you see it?

826
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,311
The ritual?

827
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,519
The Ritual of Chüd?

828
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:08,398
I knew you would see it.

829
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:12,559
I saw the whole fucking thing, Mike.

830
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:14,356
That's how we kill It.

831
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:23,153
How are we going to do it?

832
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:27,032
Everybody already said no.

833
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,450
But with you...

834
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:32,204
they'll listen.

835
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:35,916
This won't work without all of us.

836
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:42,548
Okay. So, what do you mean
that you've seen us all die?

837
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,516
Yeah, 'cause I gotta be honest.

838
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,850
That's a fucked-up thing
to just drop on somebody.

839
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,519
Every night since Derry...

840
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:52,718
I've been having these nightmares.

841
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:56,903
People in pain. People dying.

842
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:58,531
People...

843
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,385
So, you have nightmares.
I have nightmares.

844
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:01,570
People, they have nightmares.

845
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:04,487
But that doesn't mean
that your visions are true.

846
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:09,374
I've watched every single one of us...

847
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:12,411
You've seen
every single one of us what?

848
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:19,676
At the place that Stanley wound up.

849
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,296
That's how we end.

850
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:26,077
Okay, how come the rest of us
aren't seeing that shit?

851
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,683
I mean, what makes her so different?

852
00:52:28,604 --> 00:52:29,604
The Deadlights.

853
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:33,144
The Deadlights.

854
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,779
She was the only one of us

855
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,948
that got caught
in the Deadlights that day.

856
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:52,584
We were all touched by It.

857
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:54,045
Changed.

858
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:57,881
Deep down. Like an infection.
Or a virus.

859
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:00,174
A virus. You understand.

860
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:01,551
Slowly growing.

861
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:05,384
That virus, it's been growing
for 27 years.

862
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,549
This whole time, metastasizing.

863
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:10,139
- It just got to Stan first, because...
- He was the weakest.

864
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:11,598
Jesus Christ, Rich.

865
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:13,527
Just saying what everyone else
is thinking, man.

866
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,143
I mean, Rich, come on.

867
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,650
What Beverly sees, it will come to pass.

868
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,798
It's what'll happen
to all of us, eventually...

869
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:21,029
unless we stop It.

870
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:22,814
How the hell are we supposed to do that?

871
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,067
The Ritual of Chüd.

872
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:27,986
The Shokopiwah.

873
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:31,698
The first ones who fought It,
they have a saying.

874
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:35,118
"All living things must abide
by the laws of the shape they inhabit."

875
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,331
A tribal ritual?

876
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,710
Are you fucking kidding me, man?

877
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,111
All right, there's gotta be another way.

878
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,172
Okay? This thing comes back,
what, every 27 years?

879
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,824
Let's just kick the can down the road
and do it then.

880
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:47,384
Wait, we'll be 70 years old, asshole.

881
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:48,844
It doesn't work that way.

882
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,138
None of us make it another 20 years...

883
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:54,683
and the way it happens...

884
00:53:57,276 --> 00:53:59,859
So, if we don't beat It
this cycle, then...

885
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,394
We die.

886
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:02,733
Horribly.

887
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,341
Yeah, I don't need the "horribly" part.

888
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:06,149
I didn't say it. She said it.
Not me.

889
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,487
All right, guys. Look.

890
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:10,324
I've seen
what he's talking about...

891
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:13,414
and it's all true.

892
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:15,784
It's the only way.

893
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,378
If we want this ritual to work...

894
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:20,757
We have to remember.

895
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:23,333
Remember what?

896
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,927
<i>It's better if I show you.</i>

897
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:33,885
<i>We don't have much time.</i>

898
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,230
<i>This cycle will end soon.</i>

899
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:41,359
<i>And once it does...</i>

900
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,610
<i>We're fucked.</i>

901
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:07,377
The Barrens.

902
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:08,920
This is where we came.

903
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:11,259
After the rock fight.

904
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,143
The clubhouse.

905
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:16,143
You built that for us.

906
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:18,166
Yeah, the hatch has got to be
around here someplace.

907
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,022
You did. I do remember that!

908
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,187
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

909
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:24,356
You okay?

910
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,156
- What?
- Nothing, it's just...

911
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:31,818
You haven't changed.

912
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,954
It's a good thing.

913
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:41,335
You know what? I actually think
the door was more like...

914
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,840
around...

915
00:55:50,222 --> 00:55:51,222
Found it.

916
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:53,048
I'm okay!

917
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:54,845
Come down!

918
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,276
What the dick is this?

919
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:14,660
How'd you build it?

920
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:17,197
When did you build it?

921
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,452
Here and there, I guess.

922
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:23,165
It was already dug out from something,
so I just had to reinforce the walls...

923
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,671
and get some wood for the roof door...

924
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:26,756
and that's pretty much it.

925
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:28,837
Pretty good for my first time, huh?

926
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,366
Now, that's a cool feature.

927
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,827
What happens when you put your hand
on the other pillar, professor?

928
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:38,639
Okay, you see, this is exactly
why there are safety codes...

929
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:39,848
why we have permits.

930
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:41,624
This place is a death trap.
You understand that?

931
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,480
Well, it's a work in progress.
Okay, Eddie?

932
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:44,961
Just so you know, I get hurt,
you are liable.

933
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:47,088
And, also, what is this?
The switch of an iron maiden?

934
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,319
That's a flashlight.

935
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:51,026
What is that, a horse hitch?
When do you have horses down...

936
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,281
Oh, this is cool.

937
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:54,818
That was like, three dollars,
so be careful with that, please.

938
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,782
I have one of these.
Hey, Stan, you see this?

939
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,162
Yeah, okay, can you maybe not?

940
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:00,573
Maybe not what? Yeah, yeah, hold on.
Maybe not what?

941
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:03,334
Be awesome and have fun and celebrate
the magic of the paddle-ball?

942
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:05,379
Wow.

943
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:07,775
Oh, good going, fucknut.
You broke his thing.

944
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,916
- I broke it?
- Yeah, you broke it with your face.

945
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:11,218
What?

946
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:13,459
I'm not putting
my fucking hand down there.

947
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:22,061
Oh, man. That's so cool.

948
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:24,017
Oh, my God.

949
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,897
How do we all not remember
that this was here?

950
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:29,776
Hey, Losers.

951
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,073
Time to float.

952
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:41,406
- Ah.
- Fuck, Richie.

953
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,916
- Dude!
- Remember when he used to say that shit?

954
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,580
And he'd do that little dance.

955
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:50,109
Am I the only one
who remembers this shit?

956
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,253
Are you gonna be like this
the entire time we're home?

957
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:55,323
All right. Just trying to add
some levity to this shit.

958
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:56,633
I'll go fuck myself.

959
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,274
It smells so fucking
terrible in here.

960
00:58:04,356 --> 00:58:05,563
Hey, you guys?

961
00:58:07,943 --> 00:58:10,811
This says, "Stan.

962
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:13,980
For the use of Losers only."

963
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:17,785
Bill.

964
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,337
The fuck is this?

965
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,984
So you don't get spiders stuck
in your hair when you're down here.

966
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,768
Stanley, we're not afraid
of fucking spiders.

967
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:37,428
I stand corrected.

968
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:39,597
That's a first.

969
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,350
Touché.

970
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:43,335
Hey, Rich, your ten minutes are up.

971
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:44,642
What are you talking about?

972
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:46,687
The hammock.
Ten minutes each was the rule.

973
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:47,973
I don't see any sign.

974
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:49,669
Are you being this way right now?
Really? No, no, no.

975
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:51,754
Why would there be a sign
if it was a verbal agreement?

976
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:54,566
And I remember you agreeing
on the fucking rule!

977
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:58,344
- I can see your vagina!
- Ten minutes each.

978
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,328
Go back in your dumb little corner!

979
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,699
I fucked your mom!

980
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:04,831
No, you didn't.
Take that back!

981
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,250
Fuck you.

982
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:07,770
You're awfully good at this, new kid.

983
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,126
I totally did your mom.

984
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:10,378
You really think so?

985
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:14,291
There's actually a summer program
in Bar Harbor.

986
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:16,262
Teaches you, like, everything
about architecture.

987
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:18,948
- I was thinking about applying.
- I'll do that.

988
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,772
I'll do anything
to get the hell out of Derry.

989
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:23,591
Man, when I graduate,
I'm going to Florida.

990
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:25,301
What's in Florida, Mike?

991
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:27,769
I don't know.

992
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:30,346
You know, I guess it's just a place
I always wanted to go.

993
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:32,146
Stan, you should go
with Mike to Florida.

994
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:33,275
You already act 80.

995
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,357
You'd clean up with all the grandmas.

996
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:41,116
Do you guys think
we'll still be friends?

997
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:44,411
When we're older?

998
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:45,996
What?

999
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:48,324
Why wouldn't we be?

1000
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:52,628
Do any of your parents still hang out
with their friends from middle school?

1001
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:55,835
I mean, things might be different then.

1002
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,005
We all might be different.

1003
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,301
We'll always still be friends.

1004
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:08,804
I don't think that just, you know,
goes away because we get older.

1005
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:12,256
Yeah, Stan. Come on.

1006
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:15,852
You don't have to be so...

1007
01:00:17,072 --> 01:00:18,153
Sad.

1008
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:24,239
He was old before his time.

1009
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,154
Yeah.

1010
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:28,911
I wonder what he was like all grown up.

1011
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,458
Probably what he was like as a kid.

1012
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,340
The best.

1013
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:38,884
Here.

1014
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:42,279
All right, Mike. What are we doing here?

1015
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:45,306
The ritual.

1016
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,717
To perform it requires a sacrifice.

1017
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:49,385
Sacrifice? I nominate Eddie.

1018
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:50,518
Wait, what?

1019
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:52,444
Because you're little.
You'll fit on a barbeque.

1020
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,502
I'm 5'9". It's, like, average height
in most of the world.

1021
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:56,984
It's not that kind of a sacrifice, guys.

1022
01:00:58,113 --> 01:00:59,320
Mike?

1023
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,280
The past is buried.

1024
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:03,642
But you're gonna have to dig it up.

1025
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,659
Piece by piece.

1026
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:07,824
And these pieces...

1027
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:09,330
these artifacts...

1028
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:11,824
that's why we're here.

1029
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:15,453
They are what you'll sacrifice.

1030
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,831
And since Stan isn't here to find his...

1031
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:22,241
I figured we should all be here together
to find his artifact.

1032
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:26,673
I think Bill just did that.

1033
01:01:32,147 --> 01:01:34,434
Okay, Mike,
so where do we find our tokens?

1034
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,252
Yeah, I gotta be honest, man.
All due respect.

1035
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:38,393
This is fucking stupid, all right?

1036
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:39,936
Why do we need tokens? All right?

1037
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:42,776
We already remember everything.
Saving Bev, defeating It...

1038
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:44,736
I mean, we're caught up!

1039
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,070
It's not everything.

1040
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:50,120
We fought. But what happened after that?

1041
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:52,532
Before the house on Neibolt.

1042
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:55,246
Think.

1043
01:01:57,422 --> 01:02:00,005
We can't remember, can we?

1044
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:01,919
See, there's more to our story.

1045
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,592
What happened that summer.

1046
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:06,049
And those blank spaces...

1047
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:07,884
like pages torn out of a book.

1048
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:10,224
That's what you need to find.

1049
01:02:11,186 --> 01:02:12,427
We need to split up.

1050
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:14,686
You each need to find your artifact.

1051
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:16,973
Alone. That's important.

1052
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:18,484
When you do...

1053
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,026
meet me at the library tonight.

1054
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:22,690
Yeah, I gotta say...

1055
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,026
statistically speaking,
you look at survival scenarios...

1056
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:26,594
we're gonna do much better as a group.

1057
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:28,610
Yeah, splitting up would be dumb, man.

1058
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:30,528
Okay, we gotta go together. All right?

1059
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,020
We were together that summer, right?

1060
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:33,374
No.

1061
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:37,664
Not that whole summer.

1062
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:39,962
Take it back.

1063
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,664
Bill!

1064
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:44,883
You're just a bunch of losers.

1065
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:46,756
Fuck off!

1066
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:48,012
- Fucking...
- Stop!

1067
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:52,891
We were all together when we hurt It.

1068
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:55,178
That's why we're still alive.

1069
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:57,392
Yeah? Well, I plan to keep it that way.

1070
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,598
I bet by tomorrow,
we'll all be back together.

1071
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,495
I don't think so.

1072
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:15,553
Well, if we're gonna stop It,
we better be.

1073
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:18,792
Maybe Richie was right.

1074
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:24,465
Maybe we shouldn't do anything about It,
or maybe we can't.

1075
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:26,296
Okay, don't let them get to you.

1076
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:28,343
It's a little late for that.

1077
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,591
You should go.

1078
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:36,889
Before your dad sees.

1079
01:04:12,057 --> 01:04:13,093
Yes?

1080
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:15,720
Sorry.

1081
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,227
May I help you?

1082
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,763
I thought I rang Marsh.

1083
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:22,147
Marsh?

1084
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,692
Alvin Marsh?

1085
01:04:25,487 --> 01:04:26,978
My father.

1086
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:28,938
I grew up here.

1087
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:37,409
Dear...

1088
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:39,790
it's not for me to tell you this...

1089
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:42,872
but your father passed away.

1090
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:47,089
I'm so sorry. You didn't know?

1091
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:52,211
We hadn't spoken in a while.

1092
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,806
Well, won't you come in?

1093
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,933
Let me offer you something to drink.

1094
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:00,560
No, it's fine. I have to go.

1095
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:03,056
It's the least I can do.

1096
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:07,268
Sure. Okay.

1097
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:21,540
Is it like you remember?

1098
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:23,618
Cleaner.

1099
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:28,415
Well, you feel free to look around
while I get the water boiling.

1100
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:30,152
Oh, really, it's fine.
You don't need to do that.

1101
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,667
Don't be so polite.

1102
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:02,748
Today is her birthday.

1103
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,837
I can still smell her perfume.

1104
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:14,585
And she'd still be alive
if it wasn't for you.

1105
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,301
Mama was sick.

1106
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:21,308
You know
that's why she did what she did.

1107
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,890
She did what she did...

1108
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:27,564
because she was embarrassed
to be your mother.

1109
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:31,401
You look like her.

1110
01:06:34,157 --> 01:06:36,319
But you are nothing like her.

1111
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:40,536
Come here.

1112
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:45,240
I said, come here!

1113
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:49,461
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

1114
01:07:05,313 --> 01:07:07,305
You know that I would never hurt you.

1115
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:09,274
You know that, don't you?

1116
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,867
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1117
01:07:21,913 --> 01:07:24,496
You'll always be my little girl,
won't you?

1118
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:26,991
Always.

1119
01:08:37,405 --> 01:08:39,237
"Your hair is winter fire...

1120
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:42,032
January embers...

1121
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:45,406
<i>My heart burns there, too."</i>

1122
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:05,382
There. I do apologize.

1123
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:09,343
It gets so very hot here
this time of year.

1124
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:12,189
It's fine.

1125
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:15,690
When you feel like you could
just about die.

1126
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:18,898
But you know what they say about Derry.

1127
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:23,236
"No one who dies here ever really dies."

1128
01:09:36,464 --> 01:09:39,332
But tell me,
how is it being back in Derry?

1129
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:43,502
It's good. Strange.

1130
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:45,504
Strange?

1131
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:47,514
Oh, my.

1132
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:49,220
Strange, how?

1133
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:56,558
I had some cookies in the oven
before you came.

1134
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:58,100
You stay right there.

1135
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:00,360
Uh, I really... I shouldn't impose...
I'm gonna...

1136
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:02,522
No, no, no. I insist.

1137
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:10,571
Mrs. Kersh, are these your family?

1138
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:11,909
Yes, dear.

1139
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:16,328
My father came to this country
with $14 in his pocket.

1140
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:21,090
And he didn't ask for a handout the way
the people coming here these days.

1141
01:10:21,509 --> 01:10:23,091
You know what he did?

1142
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:25,173
What did he do, Mrs. Kersh?

1143
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,929
My father joined the circus.

1144
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:48,321
I was always Daddy's little girl.

1145
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:50,903
What about you?

1146
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:57,830
Are you still
his little girl, Beverly?

1147
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:03,151
Are you?

1148
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:17,475
Mustn't lie to our father!

1149
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,280
Help!

1150
01:11:26,574 --> 01:11:28,440
Run, run, run.

1151
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:30,325
Run, run.

1152
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:37,032
You haven't changed anything yet.

1153
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:43,831
You haven't changed their futures.

1154
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:51,173
You haven't saved any of them.

1155
01:11:56,187 --> 01:11:57,974
Close your eyes, Bev.

1156
01:11:58,856 --> 01:11:59,972
Fuck you!

1157
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:01,981
If you don't believe...

1158
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:06,569
close them...

1159
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:09,315
and see!

1160
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:11,117
Come on, you.
Come on.

1161
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:15,343
- Ken, you little bitch...
- Yes!

1162
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:17,142
You're fucking good.

1163
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:18,429
<i>Game over.</i>

1164
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:23,813
- I gotta go.
- Hey!

1165
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:25,478
Um...

1166
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:29,436
How about we go again?

1167
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:31,233
Play some more, you know?

1168
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:32,532
Fuck you, man.

1169
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:33,992
Only if you want to.

1170
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:37,865
Shut up.

1171
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,280
Dude, why are you being weird?

1172
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:42,282
I'm not your fucking boyfriend.

1173
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:43,543
Whoa, I...

1174
01:13:43,878 --> 01:13:45,678
- I didn't...
- What the fuck's going on here?

1175
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,942
You assholes didn't tell me your town
is full of little fairies.

1176
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:51,132
Richie fucking Tozier?

1177
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,752
What? You're trying
to bone my little cousin?

1178
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:57,464
Get the fuck out of here, faggot!

1179
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:03,265
Fucking move!

1180
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:27,627
Want a kiss, Richie?

1181
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:01,244
It's not real.
It's not real. It's not real.

1182
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:05,998
It's not real.
It's not real. It's not real.

1183
01:15:15,428 --> 01:15:17,044
I think I just shit my pants.

1184
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:32,776
Canal Days Festival.

1185
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:34,420
- Closing performance is tonight.
- Shit.

1186
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:36,483
Hope to see you there, handsome.

1187
01:15:43,831 --> 01:15:45,058
Did you miss me, Richie?

1188
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:47,165
Fuck!

1189
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:52,504
'Cause I've missed you.

1190
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:57,126
No one wants
to play with the clown anymore.

1191
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:00,258
Play a game with me, would ya?

1192
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:02,264
How about <i>Street Fighter?</i>

1193
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:04,766
Oh, yes. You like that one, don't you?

1194
01:16:07,313 --> 01:16:10,522
Or maybe Truth or Dare?

1195
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:12,725
Jesus.

1196
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:14,769
Oh, you wouldn't want...

1197
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:18,609
anyone to pick "truth," though,
would ya, Richie?

1198
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:22,571
You wouldn't want anyone to know
what you're hiding.

1199
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:28,874
<i>I know your secret</i>

1200
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:32,203
<i>Your dirty, little secret</i>

1201
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:34,959
<i>Oh, I know your secret</i>

1202
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:38,883
<i>Your dirty, little secret</i>

1203
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:40,419
Should I tell them, Richie?

1204
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:43,296
This isn't happening.
This isn't real.

1205
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:47,267
It isn't real. It isn't happening.
It isn't real.

1206
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:54,391
Come back and play!

1207
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:57,812
Come back and play with the clown!

1208
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:01,157
Hi!

1209
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:04,617
Whoa!

1210
01:17:04,662 --> 01:17:07,700
- I'm so sorry.
- Watch it, you jerk!

1211
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:12,208
Sorry.

1212
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:39,736
Oh, man!

1213
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:41,487
- Can I help you?
- Hi.

1214
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:43,865
Yeah, I want to see about the...

1215
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,156
Baseball card?

1216
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:49,658
The bowling ball?

1217
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:51,035
No, the...

1218
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:52,540
Banjo?

1219
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:54,667
Beaver?

1220
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:56,495
Fucking bike.

1221
01:17:57,131 --> 01:17:59,168
You wanna use that kind of language...

1222
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:03,092
take it out in the street.

1223
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:04,173
I'm sorry.

1224
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:07,089
Can we just start over and pretend
that I just walked in?

1225
01:18:08,601 --> 01:18:09,808
How can I help you?

1226
01:18:09,977 --> 01:18:11,889
Thank you. Yes.
I want to buy the bike.

1227
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:14,770
Aren't you William Denbrough,
the writer?

1228
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:16,435
Yeah, that's...

1229
01:18:16,483 --> 01:18:17,815
That's me.

1230
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:20,310
That bike used to be mine.

1231
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:23,146
Well, it's mine now.

1232
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:27,071
But you're the big author.
You want it, you can afford it.

1233
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:29,827
All right. How much?

1234
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:35,460
Three hundred.

1235
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:38,294
You can afford it.

1236
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:40,459
I'll get it.

1237
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:43,004
I guess that's kind of a deal.

1238
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:55,436
You, uh, want me to sign it for you?

1239
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:56,680
Nah.

1240
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:58,268
I didn't like the ending.

1241
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:02,570
Uh...

1242
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:05,404
Three big ones.

1243
01:19:05,532 --> 01:19:06,693
All yours.

1244
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:09,325
I don't know how fast she'll go.

1245
01:19:10,204 --> 01:19:11,820
Been there a lot of years.

1246
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:14,785
You know what, mister?

1247
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:18,164
She was fast enough to beat the devil.

1248
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:27,294
Come on.

1249
01:19:34,144 --> 01:19:36,101
Yeah, I missed you, too.

1250
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:44,526
Yeah!

1251
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:46,400
Whoo!

1252
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:57,365
Hi-ho, Silver!

1253
01:19:58,002 --> 01:19:59,584
Away!

1254
01:20:23,027 --> 01:20:24,268
Bye, Billy!

1255
01:20:56,643 --> 01:20:58,100
I know you're down there.

1256
01:20:58,145 --> 01:21:00,353
I know you can hear me.

1257
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:03,898
There's something I have to know.

1258
01:21:06,653 --> 01:21:08,340
All of the kids in this town
you could have taken...

1259
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:10,151
why Georgie?

1260
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:17,578
Say something!

1261
01:21:20,167 --> 01:21:21,374
Why him?

1262
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:23,501
Why him? Why him? Why him?

1263
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:44,973
Why?

1264
01:21:49,613 --> 01:21:53,732
Because you weren't there, Billy.

1265
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:11,007
Billy, don't leave.

1266
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:14,006
Hello?

1267
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:17,765
Billy.

1268
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:23,428
I'm still here.

1269
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:28,312
Help me.

1270
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:30,611
Georgie.

1271
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:37,617
Georgie?

1272
01:22:38,662 --> 01:22:40,073
Help me, Billy.

1273
01:22:41,165 --> 01:22:42,281
Take my hand.

1274
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:44,083
Take my hand.

1275
01:22:44,668 --> 01:22:45,770
I've got you, buddy. Come on.

1276
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:46,794
He's coming.

1277
01:22:48,255 --> 01:22:49,255
Take my hand!

1278
01:22:49,298 --> 01:22:51,192
- I got you. Come on.
- Billy, please. He's coming.

1279
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:52,457
- Take my hand.
- Billy!

1280
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:53,966
Come on, take my hand!

1281
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:17,990
I hate you!

1282
01:23:19,161 --> 01:23:20,447
I hate you.

1283
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:22,863
Who are you talking to?

1284
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:26,032
Move, move, move!

1285
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:27,370
Move! Move!

1286
01:23:28,378 --> 01:23:30,538
You hear voices from that sewer,
you stay away from it.

1287
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:34,252
You hear voices from the sewer?

1288
01:23:34,885 --> 01:23:36,001
No.

1289
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:38,636
No. Just stay away from that sewer.

1290
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,341
I only hear voices in the tub.

1291
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,228
You know. From the drain.

1292
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:50,981
What kind of voices?

1293
01:23:51,985 --> 01:23:53,066
Kids.

1294
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:55,815
And other times, like a...

1295
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:57,613
Like a clown?

1296
01:24:03,664 --> 01:24:05,200
You listen to me.
You listen good.

1297
01:24:05,249 --> 01:24:06,990
You need to get out of this town.

1298
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:09,312
All right? Tell your parents.
Make up a reason.

1299
01:24:09,336 --> 01:24:11,189
You make up a fucking lie.
I don't care what you do.

1300
01:24:11,213 --> 01:24:13,274
Just get out of this town.
Make them never bring you back.

1301
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:14,298
Do you understand?

1302
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:16,378
You leave Derry
and you stay out of Derry!

1303
01:24:16,426 --> 01:24:17,426
Do you understand me?

1304
01:24:17,844 --> 01:24:19,197
I'm supposed to be at the festival.

1305
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:20,883
Tell me you understand!

1306
01:24:26,687 --> 01:24:28,269
I'm supposed to be at the festival.

1307
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:30,062
I gotta go.

1308
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,601
Just be careful!

1309
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:18,997
Come on,
let's get the fuck outta here.

1310
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:21,651
Wake up, fat-ass.

1311
01:25:24,911 --> 01:25:26,402
Fucking loser.

1312
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,096
Whoa.

1313
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:52,637
Easy. It's just me.

1314
01:25:54,274 --> 01:25:56,274
What are you and your little buddies
up to in here?

1315
01:25:57,152 --> 01:26:00,270
Oh. Those guys
are definitely not my buddies.

1316
01:26:00,322 --> 01:26:02,063
No, I meant your real friends.

1317
01:26:02,115 --> 01:26:04,198
- Joey. Jonathan. Donnie. Danny.
- Oh.

1318
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:10,488
Are you smoking in school?

1319
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:13,199
Secret hideout.

1320
01:26:14,753 --> 01:26:15,914
Don't tell anyone.

1321
01:26:24,054 --> 01:26:25,295
You okay, new kid?

1322
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:27,092
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

1323
01:26:28,684 --> 01:26:31,017
I guess I'm just worried...

1324
01:26:33,146 --> 01:26:35,729
that we're not all gonna be the same
after the fight.

1325
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:39,309
As long as we can still hang out,
who cares?

1326
01:26:41,446 --> 01:26:42,482
You really mean that?

1327
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:47,233
Well, yeah, of course, dummy.

1328
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:53,994
You and me.

1329
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:01,084
Oh, my God!

1330
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:04,254
I meant as a friend.

1331
01:27:06,263 --> 01:27:08,004
You actually thought
I could like someone...

1332
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:11,345
as fat and gross
and disgusting like you?

1333
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:16,346
No matter how many
stupid poems you write...

1334
01:27:24,197 --> 01:27:25,837
"Your hair is winter fire.

1335
01:27:32,789 --> 01:27:34,121
January embers.

1336
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:39,080
My heart burns there, too."

1337
01:28:04,738 --> 01:28:06,338
That's not the real Beverly.

1338
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:08,773
Beverly would never say
anything like that.

1339
01:28:09,367 --> 01:28:10,608
She'd never say that.

1340
01:28:26,676 --> 01:28:27,792
Kiss me, fat boy.

1341
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:43,020
Oh, nobody wants to kiss the fat boy.

1342
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:44,855
Just leave me alone.

1343
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:46,564
Alone?

1344
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:51,149
Oh, you've always been alone.

1345
01:28:51,284 --> 01:28:53,526
That's not true. I have real friends.

1346
01:28:54,538 --> 01:28:56,655
Bill. Eddie. Mike. Stanley.
Richie. Beverly.

1347
01:28:56,706 --> 01:28:57,706
They're my real friends.

1348
01:28:58,083 --> 01:29:02,077
Oh, kiss me as if it were the last time.

1349
01:29:09,553 --> 01:29:10,873
What the hell are you doing, kid?

1350
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:28,860
Guys?

1351
01:29:30,156 --> 01:29:31,192
Hey.

1352
01:29:33,076 --> 01:29:34,192
Hey.

1353
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:37,615
So, what did you see out there?

1354
01:29:38,164 --> 01:29:39,780
Something I wish I hadn't.

1355
01:29:43,837 --> 01:29:45,044
So, what, we just...

1356
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:51,842
we kill It, and then we just
forget everything again?

1357
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:54,045
I hope so. Don't you?

1358
01:29:54,764 --> 01:29:55,925
I don't know.

1359
01:29:57,058 --> 01:29:59,641
Uh, I guess I want to hold on
to the good stuff, you know?

1360
01:29:59,978 --> 01:30:00,978
Mmm.

1361
01:30:01,187 --> 01:30:02,987
Come on. There must be
something from the past

1362
01:30:03,023 --> 01:30:04,605
that you don't want to forget again.

1363
01:30:06,985 --> 01:30:08,851
I remember being scared shitless.

1364
01:30:09,905 --> 01:30:11,112
Cold.

1365
01:30:12,532 --> 01:30:15,275
I remember you guys
in your tighty-whities.

1366
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:17,660
Okay. Please forget that moment.

1367
01:30:19,623 --> 01:30:20,909
I remember this.

1368
01:30:24,169 --> 01:30:26,252
I remember the boy who wrote it for me.

1369
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:30,415
Not him, so much...

1370
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:34,672
but how he made me feel.

1371
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:39,844
And a kiss.

1372
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:44,478
It's...

1373
01:30:45,482 --> 01:30:46,598
It's still blurry,

1374
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:50,314
but I think the longer
we're here, the more I can see it.

1375
01:30:51,196 --> 01:30:52,732
The more I can see that moment.

1376
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:54,776
The more I can see...

1377
01:30:56,034 --> 01:30:57,034
Bill.

1378
01:30:59,788 --> 01:31:00,869
I think.

1379
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:05,373
I don't know. Do you remember...

1380
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:09,961
Bev, um...

1381
01:31:11,591 --> 01:31:13,548
- Move. Move.
- What's wrong?

1382
01:31:13,927 --> 01:31:15,088
I'm leaving.

1383
01:31:15,804 --> 01:31:18,512
What? You can't leave, man.
We split, we all die.

1384
01:31:18,556 --> 01:31:20,798
Yeah, I'll take my chances.
We're gonna die, anyway.

1385
01:31:21,768 --> 01:31:23,509
Rich. Um...

1386
01:31:25,939 --> 01:31:27,271
Rich.

1387
01:31:29,234 --> 01:31:31,851
Hey, kids! It's Burrow the Beaver!

1388
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:36,398
Come on down. It's the last day
of the festival here at Canal Days.

1389
01:31:38,702 --> 01:31:39,738
Argh!

1390
01:31:39,786 --> 01:31:40,867
Asshole!

1391
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:56,042
Hello?

1392
01:32:08,314 --> 01:32:09,350
Can I help you?

1393
01:32:09,691 --> 01:32:12,650
Yeah, I had prescription called in
for Kaspbrak.

1394
01:32:13,236 --> 01:32:14,693
Kaspbrak?

1395
01:32:14,738 --> 01:32:15,738
It's an inhaler.

1396
01:32:17,115 --> 01:32:18,231
Ah.

1397
01:32:18,283 --> 01:32:19,649
Eddie Kaspbrak?

1398
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:21,863
Mmm-hmm. That's me.

1399
01:32:23,288 --> 01:32:24,369
I remember you.

1400
01:32:24,998 --> 01:32:25,998
Yeah.

1401
01:32:26,207 --> 01:32:27,618
How's your mom?

1402
01:32:27,667 --> 01:32:31,081
Oh, uh, well, she died a few years ago.
It's very sad. It was from liver cancer.

1403
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:32,129
What's that?

1404
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:34,167
- What's what?
- That.

1405
01:32:35,967 --> 01:32:37,003
All right.

1406
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:38,918
Okay.

1407
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:40,677
No, it's not gonna pop.
It's a mole.

1408
01:32:40,972 --> 01:32:43,055
It might not be cancer.

1409
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:44,516
Cancer?

1410
01:32:44,517 --> 01:32:45,598
Ah...

1411
01:32:46,853 --> 01:32:47,969
But it might be.

1412
01:32:48,772 --> 01:32:50,138
You just stay here.

1413
01:32:50,732 --> 01:32:52,064
I'll get you something.

1414
01:32:54,152 --> 01:32:55,268
Okay.

1415
01:33:05,121 --> 01:33:06,908
You came here
for your stinky breath pills?

1416
01:33:07,749 --> 01:33:10,162
My breath is fine.

1417
01:33:10,752 --> 01:33:11,833
Thank you.

1418
01:33:12,796 --> 01:33:14,378
That's not what my dad said.

1419
01:33:15,507 --> 01:33:17,294
He said you have a tumor.

1420
01:33:20,053 --> 01:33:21,214
On your dick.

1421
01:33:21,888 --> 01:33:24,096
But you don't
take pills for...

1422
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:28,267
Wait, what did your dad say?

1423
01:33:29,187 --> 01:33:30,303
There you go.

1424
01:33:31,898 --> 01:33:33,098
I hope your dick feels better.

1425
01:33:35,193 --> 01:33:36,309
Thank you.

1426
01:33:38,154 --> 01:33:41,022
For the inhaler,
not for the penis thing.

1427
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:42,985
Eddie!

1428
01:33:46,579 --> 01:33:47,945
Eddie bear!

1429
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:53,250
Mommy?

1430
01:33:59,425 --> 01:34:00,961
Eddie bear!

1431
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:05,511
Mommy?

1432
01:34:08,893 --> 01:34:10,725
Eddie, come help me! Quick!

1433
01:34:27,954 --> 01:34:29,536
Eddie!

1434
01:34:29,581 --> 01:34:30,947
Mommy?

1435
01:34:30,999 --> 01:34:32,240
Eddie?

1436
01:34:32,292 --> 01:34:33,328
Eddie, help me!

1437
01:34:33,835 --> 01:34:35,167
Quick, help me!

1438
01:34:35,211 --> 01:34:36,372
Mommy?

1439
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:39,463
Eddie bear,
come help me, quick!

1440
01:34:56,733 --> 01:34:57,733
Eddie?

1441
01:34:58,776 --> 01:35:00,376
The fuck is she doing here?

1442
01:35:00,445 --> 01:35:01,839
What is taking you so long?

1443
01:35:01,863 --> 01:35:03,650
I don't know. Why are you here?

1444
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:14,333
Mommy!

1445
01:35:15,251 --> 01:35:16,992
He's coming!
You gotta get me outta here!

1446
01:35:17,045 --> 01:35:18,003
- Who's coming?
- Eddie.

1447
01:35:20,256 --> 01:35:21,713
What the fuck is that?

1448
01:35:28,973 --> 01:35:29,890
Mommy.

1449
01:35:29,891 --> 01:35:31,243
You gotta
get me outta here.

1450
01:35:31,267 --> 01:35:33,509
He's coming! He's gonna kill me!

1451
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:34,642
Eddie!

1452
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:37,892
Help! Please, help me!
He's going to infect me!

1453
01:35:38,358 --> 01:35:40,020
Eddie! He's gonna infect me!

1454
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:41,068
Eddie!

1455
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:42,817
Help me!

1456
01:35:43,905 --> 01:35:45,465
Help me, Eddie!

1457
01:35:45,657 --> 01:35:47,273
He's coming, Eddie!

1458
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:48,531
Eddie, hurry!

1459
01:35:49,244 --> 01:35:50,860
He's gonna infect me, Eddie!

1460
01:35:54,249 --> 01:35:55,249
Oh, my God! Eddie!

1461
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:57,417
Hurry up, Eddie!

1462
01:36:02,632 --> 01:36:04,294
Eddie!

1463
01:36:11,849 --> 01:36:13,340
I can't do it!

1464
01:36:13,393 --> 01:36:14,600
Eddie! Eddie!

1465
01:36:14,644 --> 01:36:16,306
I'm sorry, I can't do it.

1466
01:36:17,313 --> 01:36:20,021
I knew you would leave me, Eddie!

1467
01:36:22,652 --> 01:36:23,652
Eddie, help me!

1468
01:36:29,284 --> 01:36:30,491
Eddie!

1469
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:37,550
What's all this shit doing here?

1470
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:39,332
Why is that curtain still here?

1471
01:36:40,336 --> 01:36:41,622
Okay, all right.

1472
01:36:41,671 --> 01:36:42,912
Are you gonna do this, Eds?

1473
01:36:44,132 --> 01:36:45,293
It's just a memory.

1474
01:36:45,341 --> 01:36:46,673
It's just a memory. You're fine.

1475
01:36:46,884 --> 01:36:48,591
Deep breath. Deep breath.

1476
01:36:49,971 --> 01:36:51,758
Okay. You gonna do it?

1477
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:03,390
Shit! Oh, shit! Oh, fuck!

1478
01:37:05,528 --> 01:37:06,860
Stop! Stop!

1479
01:37:10,783 --> 01:37:11,899
Stop!

1480
01:37:31,763 --> 01:37:32,924
That's right!

1481
01:37:34,057 --> 01:37:35,389
Fuck you!

1482
01:37:36,142 --> 01:37:37,804
Fuck you!

1483
01:37:51,532 --> 01:37:52,739
What the fuck?

1484
01:37:58,247 --> 01:37:59,283
What?

1485
01:37:59,332 --> 01:38:01,039
Push, don't pull, you moron.

1486
01:38:01,084 --> 01:38:03,041
Oh. Heh. Thanks.

1487
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,432
Oh, my God. What happened to you?

1488
01:38:19,811 --> 01:38:21,052
Nothing. I'm fine.

1489
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:22,561
I'm fine. Everything's fine.

1490
01:38:24,732 --> 01:38:26,085
Hey, how you doing?
Where's everybody else?

1491
01:38:26,109 --> 01:38:28,897
Richie wants to leave. Ben's upstairs
trying to get him to stay.

1492
01:38:28,945 --> 01:38:30,436
He's just scared.

1493
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:32,030
So am I, Bill.

1494
01:38:32,323 --> 01:38:33,655
Aren't you?

1495
01:38:33,908 --> 01:38:35,069
We're all scared.

1496
01:38:35,493 --> 01:38:36,493
That's what worries me.

1497
01:38:36,828 --> 01:38:38,069
Because that's what It wants.

1498
01:38:38,246 --> 01:38:39,362
We can do this...

1499
01:38:39,414 --> 01:38:40,746
but we have to stick together.

1500
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:40,722
Should we be running?

1501
01:39:40,766 --> 01:39:42,486
This is Derry.
I'm kinda getting used to it.

1502
01:40:11,839 --> 01:40:12,839
What does that mean?

1503
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:15,461
Shit. It's the kid.

1504
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:17,636
What?

1505
01:40:17,637 --> 01:40:20,129
It's the kid from the place.

1506
01:40:20,181 --> 01:40:21,342
The Chinese place.

1507
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:22,597
I saw him on the way here.

1508
01:40:22,642 --> 01:40:24,053
He lives at my old house.

1509
01:40:24,769 --> 01:40:26,385
He was going to the fair, and...

1510
01:40:30,149 --> 01:40:31,585
He's going to the fair.
I gotta help him.

1511
01:40:31,609 --> 01:40:33,350
Okay, okay. Listen to me.
We'll go together.

1512
01:40:33,402 --> 01:40:35,394
I'm gonna get Richie and Ben
and we'll go.

1513
01:40:35,446 --> 01:40:38,154
There's no time.
I can't let it happen again.

1514
01:40:38,199 --> 01:40:39,635
What happened before wasn't your fault.

1515
01:40:39,659 --> 01:40:40,617
None of it was.

1516
01:40:40,618 --> 01:40:42,200
I wish that were true, Bev.

1517
01:40:44,956 --> 01:40:46,197
Bill! Bev!

1518
01:40:47,625 --> 01:40:48,957
What is this? What happened?

1519
01:40:49,669 --> 01:40:51,001
Did Bill just leave?

1520
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:52,206
I couldn't stop him.

1521
01:40:52,255 --> 01:40:53,371
Everybody's leaving.

1522
01:40:53,422 --> 01:40:55,084
It's all right. It's Bill.
He'll be back.

1523
01:40:55,132 --> 01:40:56,293
He'll come back.

1524
01:40:57,009 --> 01:40:58,921
Well, at least I got Richie to stay.

1525
01:41:01,681 --> 01:41:02,762
Fuck. Oh.

1526
01:41:20,283 --> 01:41:22,003
And then the leper,
he threw up all over me.

1527
01:41:22,368 --> 01:41:24,649
"Hey, it's Mike Hanlon.
Why don't you come back to Maine?"

1528
01:41:27,498 --> 01:41:29,034
It's your time, Eddie.

1529
01:41:30,835 --> 01:41:31,835
What?

1530
01:41:34,338 --> 01:41:35,338
Why?

1531
01:41:35,756 --> 01:41:37,213
Why did you do that?

1532
01:41:37,717 --> 01:41:40,380
Because he says it's your time.

1533
01:41:40,428 --> 01:41:42,670
Who says it's my time?

1534
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:45,467
You know, Eddie.

1535
01:41:45,725 --> 01:41:47,387
You know.

1536
01:41:48,144 --> 01:41:50,010
Time to float.

1537
01:41:56,193 --> 01:41:57,479
Where did he go?

1538
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:02,697
Now give me back my fucking knife!

1539
01:42:21,093 --> 01:42:23,530
You should cut that fucking mullet.
It's been, like, 30 years, man.

1540
01:42:24,722 --> 01:42:25,722
Guys!

1541
01:42:27,433 --> 01:42:28,433
Oh, shit.

1542
01:42:30,186 --> 01:42:31,186
Eds?

1543
01:42:33,439 --> 01:42:34,896
Jesus, Eds. What the hell?

1544
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:37,391
- Bowers is in my room.
- Oh, my...

1545
01:42:39,904 --> 01:42:41,304
- Is it bad?
- No.

1546
01:42:42,865 --> 01:42:43,865
Oh.

1547
01:42:56,504 --> 01:42:59,224
<i>I'm gonna carve my whole
name onto this cottage cheese!</i>

1548
01:43:06,472 --> 01:43:07,588
One down!

1549
01:43:09,016 --> 01:43:10,132
Fuck yeah!

1550
01:43:37,837 --> 01:43:38,918
Hey!

1551
01:43:39,171 --> 01:43:41,003
Hey, kid! Kid!

1552
01:43:42,967 --> 01:43:44,424
I'm sorry.

1553
01:43:44,468 --> 01:43:45,468
Hey!

1554
01:43:45,928 --> 01:43:46,845
Excuse me.

1555
01:43:46,846 --> 01:43:47,882
Hey! Hey!

1556
01:43:52,685 --> 01:43:53,971
Fuck.

1557
01:44:03,821 --> 01:44:05,153
Fuck!

1558
01:44:22,548 --> 01:44:24,005
Kid! Hey, kid!

1559
01:44:25,092 --> 01:44:26,128
Fuck.

1560
01:44:26,802 --> 01:44:27,802
Kid?

1561
01:44:32,141 --> 01:44:33,141
Fuck.

1562
01:44:44,862 --> 01:44:45,862
Kid?

1563
01:44:46,614 --> 01:44:47,614
Hey!

1564
01:44:56,415 --> 01:44:58,156
Kid.

1565
01:45:03,589 --> 01:45:05,296
Kid? Hey! Hey!

1566
01:45:06,008 --> 01:45:06,925
Kid!

1567
01:45:06,926 --> 01:45:09,293
Fuck.

1568
01:45:09,929 --> 01:45:10,929
Shit.

1569
01:45:11,722 --> 01:45:12,722
Hey.

1570
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:14,176
What are you doing here?

1571
01:45:14,225 --> 01:45:15,761
Hey.

1572
01:45:16,227 --> 01:45:18,560
No, I'm here to help.

1573
01:45:18,646 --> 01:45:20,137
Stop following me!

1574
01:45:20,356 --> 01:45:22,564
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1575
01:45:29,281 --> 01:45:30,281
No.

1576
01:45:32,743 --> 01:45:33,743
Please.

1577
01:45:38,541 --> 01:45:39,827
Ah.

1578
01:45:39,875 --> 01:45:41,741
I'm here this time.
Just take me.

1579
01:45:43,003 --> 01:45:45,416
Ah.

1580
01:45:46,882 --> 01:45:48,748
Son of a bitch!

1581
01:46:00,354 --> 01:46:01,390
Help!

1582
01:46:05,276 --> 01:46:06,392
Help!

1583
01:46:07,862 --> 01:46:08,898
Help!

1584
01:46:35,472 --> 01:46:36,752
I should go back there.

1585
01:46:37,141 --> 01:46:38,994
I just fucking left them in the lurch,
man. I should go back there.

1586
01:46:39,018 --> 01:46:40,975
What the fuck are you talking about?
Fuck that.

1587
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:42,020
Fuck them.

1588
01:46:43,355 --> 01:46:45,563
I got dates in fucking Reno, man.

1589
01:46:55,367 --> 01:46:57,905
<i>Reflecting on
the meaning of what I just read...</i>

1590
01:46:58,495 --> 01:47:00,157
the word <i>"Leshanot"</i> comes up a lot...

1591
01:47:00,205 --> 01:47:03,539
which means "to change, to transform."

1592
01:47:04,877 --> 01:47:06,209
Which makes sense, I guess...

1593
01:47:06,253 --> 01:47:08,961
because today I'm supposed
to become a man.

1594
01:47:12,718 --> 01:47:13,959
<i>It's funny, though.</i>

1595
01:47:15,304 --> 01:47:20,220
<i>Everyone, I think, has some memories
they're prouder of than others, right?</i>

1596
01:47:21,852 --> 01:47:25,186
<i>And maybe that's why change is so scary.</i>

1597
01:47:27,858 --> 01:47:29,941
<i>'Cause the things we wish
we could leave behind...</i>

1598
01:47:31,570 --> 01:47:34,108
- Good morning, Mike.
- How you doing?

1599
01:47:34,156 --> 01:47:36,259
...<i>the whispers
we wish we could silence...</i>

1600
01:47:36,283 --> 01:47:38,991
His pa is the one.
The one that set that fire.

1601
01:47:41,914 --> 01:47:44,434
...<i>the nightmares
we most want to wake up from...</i>

1602
01:47:47,461 --> 01:47:49,418
<i>the memories we wish we could change...</i>

1603
01:47:54,927 --> 01:47:57,214
<i>...the secrets we feel
like we have to keep...</i>

1604
01:47:59,807 --> 01:48:01,639
<i>are the hardest to walk away from.</i>

1605
01:48:06,271 --> 01:48:07,637
<i>The good stuff?</i>

1606
01:48:09,108 --> 01:48:11,646
<i>The pictures in our mind
that fade away the fastest?</i>

1607
01:48:13,654 --> 01:48:16,362
<i>Those pieces of you it feels
the easiest to lose.</i>

1608
01:48:18,826 --> 01:48:20,909
<i>Maybe I don't want to forget.</i>

1609
01:48:23,706 --> 01:48:26,870
Maybe if that's what today
is all about...

1610
01:48:29,128 --> 01:48:30,460
forget it, right?

1611
01:48:31,422 --> 01:48:32,833
- Thank you, Stanley.
- Uh...

1612
01:48:32,881 --> 01:48:34,588
Today, I'm supposed to become a man...

1613
01:48:34,633 --> 01:48:37,467
but I don't feel any different.

1614
01:48:39,638 --> 01:48:40,754
I know I'm a loser.

1615
01:48:41,849 --> 01:48:43,090
And no matter what...

1616
01:48:44,059 --> 01:48:45,721
I always fucking will be.

1617
01:49:06,248 --> 01:49:07,830
Thanks for showing up, Stanley.

1618
01:49:49,625 --> 01:49:51,116
<i>Mike! Help!</i>

1619
01:49:52,669 --> 01:49:55,036
Help us!

1620
01:49:55,506 --> 01:49:58,169
- Please, Mikey, help!
- Help us!

1621
01:49:58,634 --> 01:50:00,421
Please, Mikey, help!

1622
01:50:01,095 --> 01:50:02,461
Mikey!

1623
01:50:28,330 --> 01:50:30,492
You should have burned, Mike.

1624
01:50:37,464 --> 01:50:39,080
Just like your druggie parents.

1625
01:50:39,133 --> 01:50:41,716
Can you see them yet?

1626
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:43,251
Crisping?

1627
01:50:44,888 --> 01:50:46,595
Like fried fucking...

1628
01:50:59,111 --> 01:51:00,852
I guess you could say
that was long overdue.

1629
01:51:01,822 --> 01:51:03,484
Get it? 'Cause we're in a library.

1630
01:51:03,532 --> 01:51:05,194
No.

1631
01:51:09,872 --> 01:51:11,363
Mike?

1632
01:51:11,415 --> 01:51:13,202
- Hey.
- Hey. Oh, my God.

1633
01:51:19,756 --> 01:51:20,792
Are you all right?

1634
01:51:20,841 --> 01:51:23,049
No, I'm not all right.
I just fucking killed a guy.

1635
01:51:24,094 --> 01:51:25,460
I was talking to Mike.

1636
01:51:27,890 --> 01:51:29,131
Where's Bill?

1637
01:51:35,564 --> 01:51:37,647
Bill, we're all at the library.
Where are you at?

1638
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:40,233
He took a little kid, Mike.

1639
01:51:40,277 --> 01:51:43,145
He took a little kid right
in fucking front of me.

1640
01:51:44,031 --> 01:51:45,192
No, no, no.

1641
01:51:45,741 --> 01:51:48,654
Look, just come here to the library.
We can talk about the plan.

1642
01:51:48,702 --> 01:51:50,864
- I'm gonna go kill It.
<i>- No, no, no.</i>

1643
01:51:50,913 --> 01:51:54,702
I don't want any of you
to get killed with me.

1644
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:55,991
<i>Bill! Bill!</i>

1645
01:52:00,923 --> 01:52:02,209
He's going to fight It alone.

1646
01:52:02,549 --> 01:52:03,960
- What?
- Alone.

1647
01:52:05,093 --> 01:52:06,093
It's about the group.

1648
01:52:06,136 --> 01:52:07,776
The ritual doesn't work
without the group.

1649
01:52:07,971 --> 01:52:09,428
Doing it together is why it'd work.

1650
01:52:13,518 --> 01:52:15,118
Mike, did he tell you
where he was going?

1651
01:52:15,938 --> 01:52:19,056
If he really wanted to kill Pennywise,
there's only one place he'll go.

1652
01:52:19,483 --> 01:52:21,336
The same place the ritual
needs to be performed.

1653
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:23,352
Oh, we're not gonna like this, are we?

1654
01:52:25,239 --> 01:52:26,239
Fuck.

1655
01:52:55,602 --> 01:52:56,888
Bill!

1656
01:52:57,604 --> 01:52:59,687
No, no, you guys, no!

1657
01:52:59,731 --> 01:53:01,643
I started all this.

1658
01:53:02,276 --> 01:53:04,313
It's my fault that you're all here.

1659
01:53:04,778 --> 01:53:08,067
This curse, this fucking thing
that's inside you all.

1660
01:53:08,115 --> 01:53:11,734
It started growing the day that
I made you go down to the Barrens...

1661
01:53:11,785 --> 01:53:16,246
because all I cared about
was finding Georgie.

1662
01:53:17,833 --> 01:53:21,122
Now, I'm gonna go in there
and I don't know what's gonna happen...

1663
01:53:21,169 --> 01:53:23,661
but I can't ask you to do this.

1664
01:53:26,174 --> 01:53:27,174
Well...

1665
01:53:27,551 --> 01:53:28,837
we're not asking you, either.

1666
01:53:29,678 --> 01:53:31,715
- Bev...
- We didn't do it alone then, Bill...

1667
01:53:32,347 --> 01:53:34,009
so we're not gonna do this alone now.

1668
01:53:35,017 --> 01:53:36,633
Losers stick together.

1669
01:53:42,566 --> 01:53:45,149
So, does somebody want to say something?

1670
01:53:47,404 --> 01:53:49,987
Richie said it best
when we were here last.

1671
01:53:50,532 --> 01:53:51,532
I did?

1672
01:53:53,577 --> 01:53:55,239
- "I don't want to die"?
- Not that.

1673
01:53:56,413 --> 01:53:58,013
"You're lucky
we're not measuring dicks"?

1674
01:53:59,499 --> 01:54:00,706
No.

1675
01:54:03,170 --> 01:54:04,456
"Let's kill this fucking clown"?

1676
01:54:08,675 --> 01:54:10,291
Let's kill this fucking clown.

1677
01:54:37,621 --> 01:54:39,101
I love what he's done with the place.

1678
01:54:39,873 --> 01:54:40,954
Beep-beep, Richie.

1679
01:54:40,999 --> 01:54:42,035
All right.

1680
01:55:01,395 --> 01:55:03,115
Hey, hey.
That's the basement, right?

1681
01:55:09,069 --> 01:55:10,069
Ben?

1682
01:55:11,696 --> 01:55:13,403
No! Hey, hey! Ben!

1683
01:55:13,448 --> 01:55:14,448
Ben!

1684
01:55:14,449 --> 01:55:15,656
Ben? What's wrong?

1685
01:55:18,036 --> 01:55:19,036
Ben!

1686
01:55:19,079 --> 01:55:20,079
Okay. All right.

1687
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:21,080
Ben!

1688
01:55:28,338 --> 01:55:29,829
Okay, that can't be good, right?

1689
01:55:31,383 --> 01:55:33,750
Help! Hey!

1690
01:55:47,941 --> 01:55:48,941
It's Stan.

1691
01:55:52,821 --> 01:55:53,901
It can't be real.

1692
01:55:56,658 --> 01:55:57,658
Oh!

1693
01:55:59,661 --> 01:56:01,072
- Oh, God.
- Oh, shit.

1694
01:56:10,172 --> 01:56:12,255
I'd still be alive
if it wasn't for you, Bill.

1695
01:56:13,341 --> 01:56:14,341
No.

1696
01:56:19,097 --> 01:56:20,097
Beverly!

1697
01:56:42,245 --> 01:56:44,077
Richie, what's happening to me?

1698
01:57:04,392 --> 01:57:06,679
You gotta be fucking kidding.

1699
01:57:12,901 --> 01:57:14,267
Fuck!

1700
01:57:15,987 --> 01:57:17,853
Oh, God damn, get it away from me.

1701
01:57:18,031 --> 01:57:19,031
Oh, God!

1702
01:57:34,839 --> 01:57:35,839
Eddie.

1703
01:57:37,133 --> 01:57:38,133
Are you okay?

1704
01:57:38,593 --> 01:57:39,593
I'm...

1705
01:57:44,266 --> 01:57:45,928
Oh, there he is.

1706
01:57:49,938 --> 01:57:50,978
Get it off of me!

1707
01:57:52,649 --> 01:57:53,685
Get it off of me!

1708
01:57:55,610 --> 01:57:56,610
Richie!

1709
01:57:56,611 --> 01:57:58,773
- Richie!
- Richie! Hey!

1710
01:58:01,658 --> 01:58:03,498
- Get it off of me!
- I wanna go home.

1711
01:58:04,828 --> 01:58:06,535
Get the knife!

1712
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:08,242
God damn it, Eddie, get the knife!

1713
01:58:08,290 --> 01:58:10,077
Bill!
Get it off of me, Bill! Quick!

1714
01:58:13,211 --> 01:58:14,292
Eddie, get the knife!

1715
01:58:16,006 --> 01:58:17,087
Fuck!

1716
01:58:37,902 --> 01:58:39,689
What?

1717
01:58:50,790 --> 01:58:52,656
Is everybody okay?

1718
01:58:52,709 --> 01:58:54,496
You all right?

1719
01:58:55,670 --> 01:58:57,753
He could have
fucking died, man.

1720
01:58:57,797 --> 01:58:59,038
You know that, right?

1721
01:58:59,090 --> 01:59:00,422
I can't see.

1722
01:59:00,717 --> 01:59:04,051
Georgie's dead. The kid's dead.
Stanley's dead.

1723
01:59:04,512 --> 01:59:05,878
You want Richie, too?

1724
01:59:05,930 --> 01:59:07,091
You want Richie, too?

1725
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:09,223
I don't want Richie, too.
I don't. I don't.

1726
01:59:14,064 --> 01:59:15,771
Please don't be mad, Bill.

1727
01:59:19,944 --> 01:59:22,231
I was just scared.

1728
01:59:24,616 --> 01:59:26,858
That's what
he wants, right?

1729
01:59:29,746 --> 01:59:31,282
Don't give it to him.

1730
01:59:44,344 --> 01:59:45,676
A lot of memories, huh?

1731
01:59:48,431 --> 01:59:49,431
All bad.

1732
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:03,320
Oh, man.

1733
02:00:05,240 --> 02:00:06,776
Gray water.

1734
02:00:45,113 --> 02:00:46,479
Shit. This is it.

1735
02:00:48,658 --> 02:00:49,739
This is where it happened.

1736
02:01:05,675 --> 02:01:07,086
No, no, no.

1737
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:08,717
No, no. Ugh.

1738
02:01:17,479 --> 02:01:18,595
Bevvie.

1739
02:01:28,323 --> 02:01:29,323
Bev, what is it?

1740
02:01:34,704 --> 02:01:35,824
I thought I heard something.

1741
02:01:38,625 --> 02:01:39,625
Bev!

1742
02:01:40,084 --> 02:01:41,541
Time to sink!

1743
02:01:45,173 --> 02:01:46,380
Bev!

1744
02:01:48,843 --> 02:01:49,843
Guys.

1745
02:01:52,972 --> 02:01:54,429
Okay, guys. Come on.

1746
02:01:59,187 --> 02:02:00,187
Hey, guys.

1747
02:02:01,189 --> 02:02:03,181
Guys, come on. Please, come on.

1748
02:02:03,233 --> 02:02:04,895
I don't want to walk out of here alone.

1749
02:02:08,863 --> 02:02:10,479
You okay?

1750
02:02:10,865 --> 02:02:12,276
I feel like crying.

1751
02:02:12,951 --> 02:02:15,238
Mike. Where do we go from here?

1752
02:02:22,836 --> 02:02:24,498
In the depths is where It crept.

1753
02:02:24,546 --> 02:02:26,253
In the beneath, to find belief.

1754
02:02:26,297 --> 02:02:27,577
In the depths is where It crept.

1755
02:02:28,049 --> 02:02:29,151
In the beneath, to find belief.

1756
02:02:29,175 --> 02:02:30,507
Is he okay?

1757
02:02:30,552 --> 02:02:32,794
I think at this point,
that's a relative question.

1758
02:02:32,846 --> 02:02:34,007
What's on the other side?

1759
02:02:34,597 --> 02:02:36,884
I don't know. No one does.

1760
02:02:39,936 --> 02:02:41,347
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1761
02:02:41,396 --> 02:02:42,432
Mike.

1762
02:02:48,027 --> 02:02:49,734
- Mike, don't.
- All right.

1763
02:02:50,196 --> 02:02:51,549
- See you down there.
- Mike!

1764
02:02:51,573 --> 02:02:52,573
Wait!

1765
02:02:58,913 --> 02:03:00,654
- Stay together.
- Okay.

1766
02:03:04,335 --> 02:03:05,335
You guys, I can't do it.

1767
02:03:07,505 --> 02:03:09,747
I can't. You saw what happened up there.

1768
02:03:09,799 --> 02:03:11,335
I was gonna let you die.

1769
02:03:11,968 --> 02:03:13,300
I just fucking froze up.

1770
02:03:13,887 --> 02:03:15,549
If you let me go down there with you...

1771
02:03:16,055 --> 02:03:17,533
I'm gonna get us all killed.

1772
02:03:17,557 --> 02:03:18,764
Hey, hey, hey. Give me that.

1773
02:03:18,850 --> 02:03:21,092
- Richie.
- Give me that. Let go, you little turd.

1774
02:03:21,436 --> 02:03:23,223
Just let me get...

1775
02:03:24,522 --> 02:03:25,558
- I got it.
- Stop.

1776
02:03:26,566 --> 02:03:28,057
Listen to me.

1777
02:03:28,109 --> 02:03:29,850
You had a moment. Fine.

1778
02:03:29,903 --> 02:03:32,065
But who killed a psychotic clown
before he was 14?

1779
02:03:34,240 --> 02:03:35,198
Me.

1780
02:03:35,199 --> 02:03:37,639
Who stabbed Bowers with a knife
he pulled out of his own face?

1781
02:03:37,827 --> 02:03:38,988
Also me.

1782
02:03:39,037 --> 02:03:40,917
Who married a woman ten times
his own body mass?

1783
02:03:43,374 --> 02:03:44,785
- Me.
- Yeah.

1784
02:03:48,212 --> 02:03:49,578
You're braver than you think.

1785
02:03:50,673 --> 02:03:51,673
All right. Thanks, Rich.

1786
02:03:52,759 --> 02:03:54,421
- Ow.
- Sorry.

1787
02:03:57,055 --> 02:03:58,341
Hey. Here.

1788
02:03:58,389 --> 02:03:59,425
Take it.

1789
02:03:59,474 --> 02:04:00,885
It kills monsters.

1790
02:04:03,436 --> 02:04:04,802
- Does it?
- Yeah.

1791
02:04:05,772 --> 02:04:07,058
If you believe it does.

1792
02:04:08,816 --> 02:04:09,852
Thanks, Bev.

1793
02:04:28,336 --> 02:04:30,123
- You guys good?
- Yeah.

1794
02:04:35,301 --> 02:04:37,696
- Can you get through that?
- It's the only way. This way.

1795
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:38,961
It's in here!

1796
02:04:42,892 --> 02:04:44,099
Through here.

1797
02:04:44,143 --> 02:04:45,975
It's tight, but we can get through.

1798
02:05:01,744 --> 02:05:03,280
This is where It hit.

1799
02:05:24,267 --> 02:05:28,056
So, all this has been
under Derry, like, forever?

1800
02:05:28,563 --> 02:05:29,770
Not forever.

1801
02:05:30,398 --> 02:05:31,559
Just a few million years.

1802
02:06:07,810 --> 02:06:10,427
It can only be attacked
in its true form.

1803
02:06:11,147 --> 02:06:12,307
The ritual will show us that.

1804
02:06:12,523 --> 02:06:13,855
And what is It's true form?

1805
02:06:14,192 --> 02:06:15,192
I hope it's a puppy.

1806
02:06:15,735 --> 02:06:17,351
Like a Pomeranian or...

1807
02:06:18,154 --> 02:06:19,154
I'll shut up.

1808
02:06:20,198 --> 02:06:21,198
It's light.

1809
02:06:25,119 --> 02:06:26,951
A light that must be snuffed out
by darkness.

1810
02:06:40,301 --> 02:06:41,301
Your artifacts.

1811
02:06:42,845 --> 02:06:44,177
Place them in the fire.

1812
02:06:44,972 --> 02:06:46,634
The past must burn with the present.

1813
02:06:55,566 --> 02:06:58,559
Uh, this is the boat that I built...

1814
02:07:01,155 --> 02:07:02,441
with Georgie.

1815
02:07:07,328 --> 02:07:09,445
It's, uh, my inhaler.

1816
02:07:15,086 --> 02:07:16,086
Come on, dude.

1817
02:07:18,714 --> 02:07:20,751
Something that I wish I had held on to.

1818
02:07:26,347 --> 02:07:28,634
Uh, this is a page from my yearbook.

1819
02:07:29,642 --> 02:07:30,974
That only one person signed.

1820
02:07:32,353 --> 02:07:33,969
I probably should have forgotten it...

1821
02:07:35,815 --> 02:07:37,932
but I couldn't,
because I kept it in my wallet...

1822
02:07:39,902 --> 02:07:41,313
for 27 years.

1823
02:07:47,451 --> 02:07:49,443
This is a token
from the Capitol Theater.

1824
02:07:49,495 --> 02:07:50,827
You brought an actual token?

1825
02:07:50,913 --> 02:07:52,432
Yeah, man. That's what
we were supposed to do, asshole.

1826
02:07:52,456 --> 02:07:54,476
Do you have any idea how long
that's gonna take to burn?

1827
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:55,911
Yeah, but so is your inhaler, dude.

1828
02:07:55,960 --> 02:07:56,960
Guys, come on.

1829
02:07:57,003 --> 02:07:59,336
All the toxic fumes and the plastic
and shit, so...

1830
02:08:02,300 --> 02:08:03,300
Look closely, Bev.

1831
02:08:04,802 --> 02:08:05,918
You see it?

1832
02:08:06,804 --> 02:08:08,136
That's where you hit Bowers.

1833
02:08:10,141 --> 02:08:11,141
The rock fight.

1834
02:08:13,686 --> 02:08:15,473
The day these bonds were forged.

1835
02:08:16,606 --> 02:08:17,892
That's not gonna burn, either.

1836
02:08:23,613 --> 02:08:24,649
Oh, wait.

1837
02:08:28,451 --> 02:08:29,611
Couldn't forget about Stan...

1838
02:08:30,369 --> 02:08:31,485
again.

1839
02:08:36,709 --> 02:08:37,709
Okay.

1840
02:08:38,544 --> 02:08:39,544
Grab hands.

1841
02:08:41,172 --> 02:08:42,172
Come on.

1842
02:08:49,805 --> 02:08:51,091
The Ritual of Chüd.

1843
02:08:51,849 --> 02:08:53,215
It's a battle of wills.

1844
02:08:54,769 --> 02:08:56,305
The first step was our reunion.

1845
02:08:57,355 --> 02:09:00,519
The second was the gathering of tokens.

1846
02:09:03,069 --> 02:09:04,435
This is the final step.

1847
02:09:08,115 --> 02:09:09,115
What the...

1848
02:09:17,959 --> 02:09:19,291
Fuck is that?

1849
02:09:20,002 --> 02:09:20,920
Don't look at them!

1850
02:09:20,921 --> 02:09:22,481
- Are those the Deadlights?
- Don't look at it!

1851
02:09:22,505 --> 02:09:23,505
Okay.

1852
02:09:23,547 --> 02:09:26,210
Turn light into dark.
Turn light into dark. Say it!

1853
02:09:26,259 --> 02:09:27,379
- Say what?
- Say it!

1854
02:09:27,677 --> 02:09:29,339
Turn light into dark.

1855
02:09:31,264 --> 02:09:34,291
Turn light into dark.

1856
02:09:34,392 --> 02:09:36,634
Turn light into dark.

1857
02:09:37,645 --> 02:09:39,887
- Turn light into dark.
- Turn light into dark.

1858
02:09:52,660 --> 02:09:55,027
Turn light into dark.
Mike, what's happening, man?

1859
02:09:55,079 --> 02:09:56,570
Keep chanting!

1860
02:09:56,622 --> 02:09:57,703
Turn light into dark.

1861
02:10:01,168 --> 02:10:03,205
Turn light into dark!

1862
02:10:03,671 --> 02:10:05,503
Turn light into dark!

1863
02:10:15,599 --> 02:10:17,591
Turn light into dark!
Turn light into dark!

1864
02:10:17,643 --> 02:10:19,179
Is it working? Did we do it?

1865
02:10:22,565 --> 02:10:23,885
What is this? Is this part of it?

1866
02:10:24,066 --> 02:10:25,168
Mike, is this supposed to be happening?

1867
02:10:25,192 --> 02:10:26,628
- What? No, no, no.
- Keep chanting!

1868
02:10:26,652 --> 02:10:28,393
- What?
- Keep chanting!

1869
02:10:28,446 --> 02:10:29,482
Turn light into dark!

1870
02:10:29,530 --> 02:10:30,896
- Turn light into dark.
- Come on!

1871
02:10:30,948 --> 02:10:32,814
Turn light into dark.
Turn light into dark.

1872
02:10:34,618 --> 02:10:35,618
Whoa!

1873
02:10:38,080 --> 02:10:39,080
Whoa!

1874
02:10:39,790 --> 02:10:40,906
Hey! Hey!

1875
02:10:45,379 --> 02:10:46,415
Shit!

1876
02:10:49,467 --> 02:10:50,583
Move, move!

1877
02:11:00,269 --> 02:11:02,101
Bev. Bev.

1878
02:11:03,814 --> 02:11:04,774
Richie.

1879
02:11:04,775 --> 02:11:05,691
Are you okay?

1880
02:11:05,692 --> 02:11:07,432
- I can't hear shit.
- He's okay.

1881
02:11:07,818 --> 02:11:09,171
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. No, no, no.

1882
02:11:09,195 --> 02:11:10,839
- Wait, where's Mike?
- Mike!

1883
02:11:10,863 --> 02:11:12,229
- Mike!
- Mike!

1884
02:11:12,281 --> 02:11:13,943
- I'm here!
- Hey, guys.

1885
02:11:14,367 --> 02:11:15,858
Did we do it?
Did we do it?

1886
02:11:16,369 --> 02:11:19,157
We put the tokens in the thing.
That's good, right?

1887
02:11:19,205 --> 02:11:20,205
We did it, right?

1888
02:11:20,790 --> 02:11:22,873
Boo!

1889
02:11:22,917 --> 02:11:24,203
Shit! Shit!

1890
02:11:24,251 --> 02:11:27,085
Oh, did it work, Mikey? Did it work?

1891
02:11:29,507 --> 02:11:32,796
Tell them why your silly little ritual
didn't work.

1892
02:11:33,886 --> 02:11:35,502
Tell them it's all just a...

1893
02:11:36,138 --> 02:11:37,595
What's the word, Eds?

1894
02:11:37,973 --> 02:11:39,009
Gazebo?

1895
02:11:40,518 --> 02:11:41,929
Mike, what's he talking about?

1896
02:11:42,353 --> 02:11:43,353
Mikey?

1897
02:11:44,605 --> 02:11:49,066
Oh, Mikey, you never showed them
the fourth side, did you?

1898
02:11:51,153 --> 02:11:52,519
Didn't want them to know

1899
02:11:52,571 --> 02:11:57,032
what actually happened
to the poor Shokopiwah?

1900
02:12:06,627 --> 02:12:08,664
Fuck, Mikey. You lied to us, again?

1901
02:12:09,046 --> 02:12:12,039
No, but they didn't believe!

1902
02:12:12,091 --> 02:12:14,194
They didn't believe they could kill It!
That's why it didn't work back then!

1903
02:12:14,218 --> 02:12:15,675
Are you fucking kidding me, Mike?

1904
02:12:16,053 --> 02:12:17,339
- We hurt him.
- Fuck!

1905
02:12:17,388 --> 02:12:19,199
Fuck you, Mikey.

1906
02:12:19,223 --> 02:12:22,136
I needed something, anything,
for us to remember.

1907
02:12:22,476 --> 02:12:23,762
Anything for us to believe!

1908
02:12:23,811 --> 02:12:25,018
- God damn it!
- Fuck!

1909
02:12:34,029 --> 02:12:35,065
The Deadlights!

1910
02:12:35,114 --> 02:12:36,150
Don't look at them!

1911
02:12:41,495 --> 02:12:42,906
For 27 years...

1912
02:12:44,123 --> 02:12:45,785
I dreamt of you.

1913
02:12:48,210 --> 02:12:50,452
I craved you.

1914
02:12:51,130 --> 02:12:53,622
Oh, I've missed you!

1915
02:12:53,674 --> 02:12:55,757
Mike! Move back!

1916
02:12:55,801 --> 02:12:59,886
Waiting for this very moment.

1917
02:12:59,930 --> 02:13:02,513
Mikey! You gotta move, Mikey!

1918
02:13:02,558 --> 02:13:04,369
- Sorry. I'm sorry, guys.
- Mike, come on, man!

1919
02:13:04,393 --> 02:13:05,600
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1920
02:13:05,644 --> 02:13:08,102
Time to float!

1921
02:13:10,399 --> 02:13:12,231
- Oh, shit!
- Sorry.

1922
02:13:14,403 --> 02:13:16,269
Mike, come on, get up!
Get him up!

1923
02:13:16,322 --> 02:13:18,188
- Go, go!
- Run!

1924
02:13:18,240 --> 02:13:19,157
Oh, shit!

1925
02:13:19,158 --> 02:13:20,444
Run! Go, go, go!

1926
02:13:30,711 --> 02:13:32,043
Go, go, go!

1927
02:13:36,383 --> 02:13:37,383
Go!

1928
02:13:50,648 --> 02:13:51,889
Go, go, go!

1929
02:13:56,820 --> 02:13:58,900
- Where'd he go?
- Don't worry. We'll find a way out.

1930
02:14:20,261 --> 02:14:21,877
- Oh, shit!
- Can he see us?

1931
02:14:23,681 --> 02:14:25,263
- Oh, my God!
- Shit.

1932
02:14:26,141 --> 02:14:27,177
Oh, shit.

1933
02:14:28,060 --> 02:14:30,177
Holy shit! Holy shit! Run!

1934
02:14:30,229 --> 02:14:31,561
Oh, shit!

1935
02:14:33,107 --> 02:14:34,947
Shit.
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1936
02:14:41,282 --> 02:14:42,282
We're trapped.

1937
02:14:42,324 --> 02:14:43,565
Where do we go?

1938
02:14:49,206 --> 02:14:50,206
Ahhh!

1939
02:15:13,314 --> 02:15:14,475
God damn it!

1940
02:15:14,857 --> 02:15:17,395
Um, all right. "Not Scary At All."
All right?

1941
02:15:17,443 --> 02:15:18,650
No, no, no.

1942
02:15:18,694 --> 02:15:20,230
Wait. Why?

1943
02:15:20,279 --> 02:15:21,799
They're flipped. He's fucking with us.

1944
02:15:21,905 --> 02:15:23,133
Are you sure?

1945
02:15:23,157 --> 02:15:24,193
- Trust me.
- Positive?

1946
02:15:24,241 --> 02:15:25,448
- Yes!
- Okay.

1947
02:15:30,289 --> 02:15:31,370
Where's my shoe?

1948
02:15:44,303 --> 02:15:46,590
What the fuck?
You told me to trust you!

1949
02:15:48,599 --> 02:15:50,090
He's not fucking with us.

1950
02:15:50,142 --> 02:15:51,804
- Let's go to "Not Scary At All."
- Okay.

1951
02:15:58,651 --> 02:16:00,108
It's all right. Let's go.

1952
02:16:02,738 --> 02:16:04,320
Oh, shit.

1953
02:16:06,867 --> 02:16:08,529
No way am I falling for this shit again.

1954
02:16:08,577 --> 02:16:10,819
Oh, yeah.
That thing's a fucking monster.

1955
02:16:10,871 --> 02:16:12,032
Richie, make it sit.

1956
02:16:12,081 --> 02:16:14,744
I know your moves, you little bitch.

1957
02:16:17,336 --> 02:16:18,336
Rich?

1958
02:16:19,129 --> 02:16:20,620
It's gone, man.

1959
02:16:20,673 --> 02:16:21,914
- Yeah. Wait.
- Okay.

1960
02:16:21,965 --> 02:16:23,081
Okay.

1961
02:16:24,677 --> 02:16:25,677
Sit.

1962
02:16:26,887 --> 02:16:27,923
He did it.

1963
02:16:28,389 --> 02:16:29,389
Oh, that's cute.

1964
02:16:29,848 --> 02:16:31,493
- That's a good boy.
- That's actually super cute.

1965
02:16:31,517 --> 02:16:32,758
That's a good boy.

1966
02:16:32,810 --> 02:16:34,597
- Are you a good boy?
- Good boy.

1967
02:16:39,066 --> 02:16:40,398
Shit!

1968
02:16:40,442 --> 02:16:42,684
Yo, next time,
we just go with regular "Scary."

1969
02:16:42,736 --> 02:16:43,943
Next time?

1970
02:16:56,792 --> 02:16:59,034
I lost it, Billy.

1971
02:17:01,004 --> 02:17:03,587
It... It just floated off.

1972
02:17:06,385 --> 02:17:09,002
I'm not mad at you.

1973
02:17:10,597 --> 02:17:13,180
It's your fault what happened, isn't it?

1974
02:17:15,644 --> 02:17:19,513
You weren't really that sick
that morning, were you?

1975
02:17:21,275 --> 02:17:22,275
No.

1976
02:17:24,194 --> 02:17:27,153
I just pretended...

1977
02:17:27,197 --> 02:17:29,610
because I didn't want to play with you.

1978
02:17:32,995 --> 02:17:34,827
I just didn't want to.

1979
02:17:36,039 --> 02:17:38,656
You lied and I died.

1980
02:17:39,501 --> 02:17:42,585
You lied and I died.

1981
02:17:43,088 --> 02:17:46,081
You lied and I died!

1982
02:17:46,133 --> 02:17:51,083
You lied and I died!

1983
02:17:51,180 --> 02:17:53,217
It happened because of me, Georgie. Me.

1984
02:17:53,265 --> 02:17:54,472
No, no, no.

1985
02:18:02,983 --> 02:18:04,519
Lied and died!

1986
02:18:04,568 --> 02:18:06,059
Lied and died!

1987
02:18:06,111 --> 02:18:07,852
Lied and died!

1988
02:18:07,905 --> 02:18:10,022
You lied and I died!

1989
02:18:42,564 --> 02:18:44,430
You in there, you little shit?
I can smell you.

1990
02:18:45,818 --> 02:18:47,775
You smell just like Lois Lane.

1991
02:18:48,779 --> 02:18:49,986
Here's Johnny!

1992
02:19:30,237 --> 02:19:31,853
All that success...

1993
02:19:31,905 --> 02:19:33,441
all those sit-ups...

1994
02:19:33,490 --> 02:19:38,360
but deep down, still just
a little fat, fat, fatty loser...

1995
02:19:39,955 --> 02:19:43,244
who always knew he would die alone.

1996
02:19:45,294 --> 02:19:46,830
No!

1997
02:19:50,090 --> 02:19:52,082
- Slut!
- Bev!

1998
02:19:54,928 --> 02:19:56,089
Beverly!

1999
02:19:57,014 --> 02:19:58,014
Bevvie.

2000
02:19:58,432 --> 02:20:00,594
Just open up the door for me, okay?

2001
02:20:01,268 --> 02:20:03,260
Beverly, can you hear me?

2002
02:20:04,605 --> 02:20:06,642
Come to Daddy, now.

2003
02:20:07,316 --> 02:20:08,432
Bev, don't listen!

2004
02:20:10,569 --> 02:20:11,569
Bev!

2005
02:20:12,487 --> 02:20:14,695
Are you still my little girl, Bevvie?

2006
02:20:16,617 --> 02:20:18,324
Beverly, I love you!

2007
02:20:19,620 --> 02:20:20,536
Ben!

2008
02:20:20,537 --> 02:20:22,699
Are you still my little girl, Bevvie?

2009
02:20:23,123 --> 02:20:25,115
Are you still my little girl?

2010
02:20:25,167 --> 02:20:26,167
Not anymore!

2011
02:20:29,296 --> 02:20:30,628
You little...

2012
02:20:31,423 --> 02:20:33,289
"Your hair is winter fire.

2013
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:37,002
January embers.

2014
02:20:37,054 --> 02:20:38,716
My heart...

2015
02:20:41,683 --> 02:20:42,764
My heart..."

2016
02:20:44,978 --> 02:20:45,978
No!

2017
02:20:52,319 --> 02:20:53,526
Ben!

2018
02:20:54,613 --> 02:20:55,774
Ben!

2019
02:21:18,053 --> 02:21:19,339
"January embers."

2020
02:21:21,181 --> 02:21:23,013
"My heart burns there, too."

2021
02:21:24,810 --> 02:21:26,051
It was you.

2022
02:21:41,451 --> 02:21:42,908
We deserve to die.

2023
02:21:42,953 --> 02:21:43,953
No.

2024
02:21:44,538 --> 02:21:48,782
You were
the best big brother there ever was.

2025
02:21:48,834 --> 02:21:51,747
No! We killed our little brother!

2026
02:21:53,046 --> 02:21:54,412
He loved you.

2027
02:21:55,007 --> 02:21:57,966
And just because you didn't want to play
on a rainy day...

2028
02:21:58,927 --> 02:22:00,668
just one time...

2029
02:22:03,223 --> 02:22:05,135
that does not make it our fault.

2030
02:22:16,653 --> 02:22:17,985
And it never...

2031
02:22:20,574 --> 02:22:21,815
ever...

2032
02:22:25,037 --> 02:22:26,037
...did.

2033
02:23:00,530 --> 02:23:01,530
Bill.

2034
02:23:03,116 --> 02:23:04,402
Miss me?

2035
02:23:05,911 --> 02:23:07,948
I know what you are.

2036
02:23:07,996 --> 02:23:09,237
That's why I'm not afraid.

2037
02:23:16,004 --> 02:23:17,961
Well, I know what you are.

2038
02:23:20,050 --> 02:23:21,507
A madman.

2039
02:23:28,058 --> 02:23:29,094
Hey, fuckface!

2040
02:23:36,149 --> 02:23:37,731
You wanna play Truth or Dare?

2041
02:23:37,776 --> 02:23:38,937
Here's a truth.

2042
02:23:38,985 --> 02:23:40,271
You're a sloppy bitch!

2043
02:23:41,029 --> 02:23:42,110
Yeah, that's right!

2044
02:23:42,155 --> 02:23:44,272
Let's dance! Yippee-ki-yay...

2045
02:24:17,732 --> 02:24:19,974
This kills monsters.

2046
02:24:20,902 --> 02:24:24,475
If you believe it does.

2047
02:24:25,490 --> 02:24:27,026
If you believe it does.

2048
02:24:27,993 --> 02:24:29,609
If you believe it does.

2049
02:24:31,830 --> 02:24:34,868
Beep-beep, motherfucker!

2050
02:24:53,727 --> 02:24:54,727
Holy shit!

2051
02:24:59,024 --> 02:25:00,060
Rich!

2052
02:25:00,609 --> 02:25:01,725
Rich!

2053
02:25:01,776 --> 02:25:03,233
Hey, Rich, wake up!

2054
02:25:03,278 --> 02:25:04,485
Hey.

2055
02:25:04,529 --> 02:25:06,191
Yeah, yeah! There he is, buddy!

2056
02:25:06,239 --> 02:25:07,821
Hey, Richie, listen!

2057
02:25:07,866 --> 02:25:09,073
I think I got him, man!

2058
02:25:11,453 --> 02:25:12,614
I think I killed It!

2059
02:25:12,662 --> 02:25:14,494
I did! I think I killed It for real!

2060
02:25:19,336 --> 02:25:20,336
Eddie.

2061
02:25:22,923 --> 02:25:23,959
Richie.

2062
02:25:27,260 --> 02:25:28,260
Richie.

2063
02:25:33,266 --> 02:25:34,266
No!

2064
02:25:35,894 --> 02:25:36,894
Eddie.

2065
02:25:37,479 --> 02:25:40,392
Uh-Oh!

2066
02:25:41,900 --> 02:25:43,357
No!

2067
02:25:56,581 --> 02:25:57,617
Eddie!

2068
02:26:04,172 --> 02:26:05,208
Eds!

2069
02:26:06,341 --> 02:26:08,082
- Eds! Eds!
- Eddie!

2070
02:26:08,635 --> 02:26:10,171
Eds, come on, man.

2071
02:26:11,096 --> 02:26:12,962
Be careful! Be careful!

2072
02:26:23,650 --> 02:26:25,983
Come out and play, Losers!

2073
02:26:27,529 --> 02:26:28,895
He's hurt. He's hurt really bad.

2074
02:26:28,947 --> 02:26:30,258
- We gotta get him out of here.
- Ahhh!

2075
02:26:30,282 --> 02:26:31,944
How are we supposed to do that, Richie?

2076
02:26:35,745 --> 02:26:37,281
I almost killed It.

2077
02:26:38,707 --> 02:26:39,707
The leper.

2078
02:26:40,750 --> 02:26:42,286
My hands around his throat.

2079
02:26:42,919 --> 02:26:45,081
And I could feel him choking.

2080
02:26:46,506 --> 02:26:47,997
I made him small.

2081
02:26:53,471 --> 02:26:54,757
He seemed so weak.

2082
02:26:55,932 --> 02:26:57,013
He seemed...

2083
02:26:57,642 --> 02:26:59,304
He seemed so weak.

2084
02:27:00,312 --> 02:27:01,312
The Shokopiwah.

2085
02:27:01,354 --> 02:27:02,354
Huh?

2086
02:27:02,939 --> 02:27:05,682
All living things must abide by the laws
of the shape they inhabit.

2087
02:27:07,027 --> 02:27:08,027
Guys!

2088
02:27:08,570 --> 02:27:10,527
There's a passageway. Through here.

2089
02:27:11,781 --> 02:27:12,781
The tunnel.

2090
02:27:13,616 --> 02:27:15,949
Pennywise has to make himself small...

2091
02:27:15,994 --> 02:27:18,953
to get through the entrance
of the cavern, right?

2092
02:27:18,997 --> 02:27:22,081
Okay, so, if we can get back there,
we can force him down to size.

2093
02:27:22,125 --> 02:27:23,042
Yeah.

2094
02:27:23,043 --> 02:27:25,831
We make him small.
Small enough so we can kill him.

2095
02:27:27,505 --> 02:27:31,499
I can smell
the stink of your fear!

2096
02:27:33,053 --> 02:27:34,965
- Let's go! Go!
- Come on! Come on!

2097
02:27:35,013 --> 02:27:36,925
It's tight. Be careful!

2098
02:27:51,237 --> 02:27:53,524
I need a little rest. Oh, thanks.

2099
02:27:55,742 --> 02:27:56,742
Hey.

2100
02:27:57,160 --> 02:27:58,492
Hey, Richie?

2101
02:27:58,536 --> 02:27:59,555
I gotta tell you something.

2102
02:27:59,579 --> 02:28:01,241
What? What's up, buddy?

2103
02:28:04,250 --> 02:28:05,457
I fucked your mother.

2104
02:28:10,632 --> 02:28:12,294
Losers out!

2105
02:28:14,594 --> 02:28:15,755
Go. Go!

2106
02:28:27,232 --> 02:28:28,148
Gotcha!

2107
02:28:31,236 --> 02:28:35,981
You filthy little children.

2108
02:28:36,032 --> 02:28:37,551
You got a plan B, man?
What the hell do we do now?

2109
02:28:37,575 --> 02:28:40,283
You die. That's what you do.

2110
02:28:40,328 --> 02:28:41,328
Mike?

2111
02:28:44,249 --> 02:28:46,129
There's more than one way
to make someone small.

2112
02:28:48,086 --> 02:28:49,247
Oh!

2113
02:28:49,379 --> 02:28:50,540
Make him believe that he is.

2114
02:28:50,588 --> 02:28:53,456
- What?
- Make him believe that he is.

2115
02:28:53,508 --> 02:28:56,672
Oh? Me? Small?

2116
02:28:57,971 --> 02:29:01,089
I am the Eater of Worlds.

2117
02:29:01,141 --> 02:29:02,177
Not to us, you're not.

2118
02:29:05,061 --> 02:29:06,347
You're just a clown.

2119
02:29:11,693 --> 02:29:12,934
You're a weak old woman.

2120
02:29:15,947 --> 02:29:18,564
The Eater of Worlds.

2121
02:29:18,616 --> 02:29:19,857
A headless boy!

2122
02:29:21,953 --> 02:29:23,160
Impostor!

2123
02:29:24,539 --> 02:29:26,246
You're a mimic!

2124
02:29:28,460 --> 02:29:29,621
A mimic!

2125
02:29:29,669 --> 02:29:32,537
You're a fucking bully!

2126
02:29:32,589 --> 02:29:34,956
You're just a fucking clown!

2127
02:29:35,008 --> 02:29:36,089
Eater of Worlds!

2128
02:29:36,134 --> 02:29:38,000
A clown! A dumb fucking clown!

2129
02:29:39,304 --> 02:29:40,511
Clown!

2130
02:29:42,640 --> 02:29:44,256
A leper!

2131
02:29:44,767 --> 02:29:45,974
You're a clown!

2132
02:29:46,644 --> 02:29:48,135
You're a clown!

2133
02:29:48,188 --> 02:29:49,349
A painting!

2134
02:29:49,397 --> 02:29:51,584
- You're a clown!
- I'm not afraid of you anymore!

2135
02:29:51,608 --> 02:29:54,772
A motherfucking stupid mummy!

2136
02:29:54,819 --> 02:29:56,902
You're a clown!

2137
02:29:57,489 --> 02:29:59,572
Clown! Clown!

2138
02:30:01,284 --> 02:30:03,492
- Clown!
- Clown!

2139
02:30:03,536 --> 02:30:05,778
You're a fucking clown!

2140
02:30:05,830 --> 02:30:07,287
You're a clown!

2141
02:30:07,332 --> 02:30:09,324
- A stupid mummy!
- Clown!

2142
02:30:10,752 --> 02:30:12,288
Clown, motherfucker!

2143
02:30:12,337 --> 02:30:15,375
I am the Eater of Worlds!

2144
02:30:20,261 --> 02:30:21,261
Clown!

2145
02:30:22,138 --> 02:30:23,879
- Clown!
- You're just a clown!

2146
02:30:23,932 --> 02:30:24,932
Clown!

2147
02:30:24,974 --> 02:30:26,681
I am the Eater of Worlds!

2148
02:30:26,726 --> 02:30:27,726
A clown!

2149
02:30:28,228 --> 02:30:29,228
Whoa.

2150
02:30:33,316 --> 02:30:34,773
No one's afraid of you.

2151
02:30:35,568 --> 02:30:36,568
No one's scared of you.

2152
02:30:38,613 --> 02:30:40,775
- Clown! Clown!
- Clown.

2153
02:30:41,991 --> 02:30:45,359
Clown. Clown. Clown.

2154
02:30:48,164 --> 02:30:49,082
Clown.

2155
02:30:49,086 --> 02:30:50,163
Clown.

2156
02:30:52,377 --> 02:30:53,413
A clown.

2157
02:30:54,629 --> 02:30:56,165
With a scared, beating heart.

2158
02:31:44,095 --> 02:31:45,836
Look at you.

2159
02:31:47,849 --> 02:31:52,560
You're all grown up.

2160
02:32:56,084 --> 02:32:57,084
Eddie. Eddie.

2161
02:33:00,963 --> 02:33:02,955
Eddie. We got Pennywise, man.

2162
02:33:05,426 --> 02:33:06,426
Eddie?

2163
02:33:19,399 --> 02:33:20,399
Richie.

2164
02:33:21,275 --> 02:33:22,275
He's gone.

2165
02:33:22,443 --> 02:33:24,338
He's all right. No, he's just hurt.
We gotta get him outta here.

2166
02:33:24,362 --> 02:33:26,319
He's hurt. Ben.

2167
02:33:26,364 --> 02:33:27,675
Bill, he's okay.
We gotta get him outta here.

2168
02:33:27,699 --> 02:33:28,699
Bev.

2169
02:33:29,742 --> 02:33:30,823
Richie.

2170
02:33:34,205 --> 02:33:35,205
What?

2171
02:33:35,456 --> 02:33:37,163
Honey, he's dead.

2172
02:33:40,837 --> 02:33:42,794
We have to go. Come on, Richie.

2173
02:33:42,839 --> 02:33:44,046
We gotta go.

2174
02:33:44,632 --> 02:33:46,043
Come on, buddy. Come on.

2175
02:33:50,221 --> 02:33:51,532
Let him go, man.
Let him go.

2176
02:33:51,556 --> 02:33:52,556
Got it.

2177
02:33:53,266 --> 02:33:56,054
We can still help him, guys!
We can still help him!

2178
02:33:57,228 --> 02:33:58,389
Go! Go! Get up!

2179
02:33:58,438 --> 02:34:00,600
Guys, we can still help him!

2180
02:34:12,452 --> 02:34:14,318
No! Eddie!

2181
02:34:20,960 --> 02:34:21,960
Come on! Let's go!

2182
02:34:26,841 --> 02:34:27,877
Come on! Let's go!

2183
02:34:30,928 --> 02:34:31,928
Move, move!

2184
02:34:38,227 --> 02:34:39,718
- Move, move!
- Run!

2185
02:34:40,104 --> 02:34:41,140
Run!

2186
02:34:55,328 --> 02:34:56,569
- Eddie!
- No, no, no!

2187
02:34:56,621 --> 02:34:57,657
Eddie!

2188
02:34:59,624 --> 02:35:01,741
We gotta get in there and get him!

2189
02:35:01,793 --> 02:35:03,534
He's still in there!

2190
02:35:14,096 --> 02:35:15,553
Eddie!

2191
02:35:16,307 --> 02:35:17,307
Eddie!

2192
02:36:16,951 --> 02:36:18,032
You know what?

2193
02:36:18,661 --> 02:36:21,028
Eddie would have hated this, guys.

2194
02:36:21,873 --> 02:36:25,116
What? Cleaning ourselves in dirty water?

2195
02:36:25,167 --> 02:36:26,167
Yeah.

2196
02:36:26,252 --> 02:36:29,120
He'd be telling us
we'd get streptococcal something.

2197
02:36:30,214 --> 02:36:31,455
Yeah.

2198
02:36:31,507 --> 02:36:33,026
But he would have made us laugh, though.

2199
02:36:33,050 --> 02:36:34,586
Oh, yeah.

2200
02:36:34,635 --> 02:36:36,547
He'd be looking out for us.

2201
02:36:38,222 --> 02:36:40,134
The way he always was.

2202
02:36:44,186 --> 02:36:45,552
Ain't that right, Richie?

2203
02:36:48,691 --> 02:36:49,691
Hey.

2204
02:37:22,308 --> 02:37:23,640
Thank you.

2205
02:37:23,684 --> 02:37:24,684
I don't have my glasses on...

2206
02:37:24,685 --> 02:37:26,288
so I don't know who you people are,
but thank you.

2207
02:37:27,396 --> 02:37:28,807
You asshole.

2208
02:37:29,398 --> 02:37:30,980
I legit can't find my glasses.

2209
02:37:31,025 --> 02:37:32,232
You're serious?

2210
02:37:32,276 --> 02:37:33,767
- Glasses?
- Go that way.

2211
02:37:33,819 --> 02:37:35,185
Around here somewhere?

2212
02:37:41,410 --> 02:37:42,888
- I can't see them.
- Oh, I see them. Right there.

2213
02:37:42,912 --> 02:37:43,828
Where?

2214
02:37:43,829 --> 02:37:45,161
Look. Right...

2215
02:37:45,206 --> 02:37:46,206
If you just go, like...

2216
02:37:47,083 --> 02:37:48,824
Anybody have any luck?

2217
02:38:50,813 --> 02:38:51,849
Hey, guys.

2218
02:38:53,774 --> 02:38:54,810
Look.

2219
02:39:04,452 --> 02:39:06,068
Nothing lasts forever.

2220
02:39:26,432 --> 02:39:28,048
I can't go home like this, guys.

2221
02:39:29,018 --> 02:39:30,054
My mom will kill me.

2222
02:39:30,352 --> 02:39:32,639
Dude, you've been gone
for 24 straight hours.

2223
02:39:32,688 --> 02:39:34,680
Your face is definitely
on a milk carton by now.

2224
02:39:35,066 --> 02:39:37,683
Also, that puke smells worse
than your mom's slippers.

2225
02:39:37,735 --> 02:39:38,651
Oh, shut up, Richie.

2226
02:39:38,652 --> 02:39:42,271
Okay, first of all, my mom's slippers
smell like potpourri, asshole.

2227
02:39:42,323 --> 02:39:43,564
No, they don't.

2228
02:39:43,616 --> 02:39:44,616
Yes, they do. And, also,

2229
02:39:44,617 --> 02:39:46,428
how would you know
what they smell like in the first place?

2230
02:39:46,452 --> 02:39:49,115
Can we just keep it quiet,
please, until we get home?

2231
02:39:49,163 --> 02:39:52,156
"Potpourri" is literally
a French word meaning "rotten pot."

2232
02:39:52,208 --> 02:39:53,894
I knew there was
something rotten about it.

2233
02:40:15,523 --> 02:40:17,139
- Mike?
<i>- Hey</i>.

2234
02:40:18,025 --> 02:40:19,516
I just thought I'd check up on you.

2235
02:40:20,361 --> 02:40:22,798
You know, just to see if you learned
how to finish a book for once.

2236
02:40:25,157 --> 02:40:26,989
I just finished the first chapter.

2237
02:40:28,911 --> 02:40:32,245
And I think I actually know
where I'm going this time.

2238
02:40:32,998 --> 02:40:33,915
Good.

2239
02:40:33,916 --> 02:40:37,330
- Say, can I ask you a question?
<i>- Sure.</i>

2240
02:40:38,671 --> 02:40:40,503
Why do you think we're not forgetting?

2241
02:40:41,465 --> 02:40:42,751
You know, like last time?

2242
02:40:42,800 --> 02:40:44,917
Maybe 'cause It's dead.

2243
02:40:48,305 --> 02:40:51,969
Or maybe 'cause we have more we want
to remember than we want to forget.

2244
02:40:52,309 --> 02:40:53,720
I like that one.

2245
02:40:57,815 --> 02:40:58,959
You decide what you want to do?

2246
02:40:58,983 --> 02:41:00,315
<i>About leaving Derry?</i>

2247
02:41:00,359 --> 02:41:03,193
Man, I've been in this cell
for 27 years.

2248
02:41:04,113 --> 02:41:05,570
Just seeing what It wanted me to.

2249
02:41:09,577 --> 02:41:12,160
I think it's time
I saw the sky for a change.

2250
02:41:13,289 --> 02:41:14,780
<i>Go get it, Mikey.</i>

2251
02:41:15,583 --> 02:41:16,699
Oh, did you get the letter?

2252
02:41:17,293 --> 02:41:18,293
Uh...

2253
02:41:18,335 --> 02:41:19,371
What letter?

2254
02:41:19,670 --> 02:41:21,286
You'll know when you see it.

2255
02:41:22,381 --> 02:41:24,464
Well, hold on. I just got the mail.

2256
02:41:24,508 --> 02:41:26,170
<i>We all got one.</i>

2257
02:41:28,971 --> 02:41:29,971
Patricia Uris?

2258
02:41:30,890 --> 02:41:31,926
<i>Just...</i>

2259
02:41:32,975 --> 02:41:34,056
Just read it.

2260
02:41:34,476 --> 02:41:35,512
Okay.

2261
02:41:35,561 --> 02:41:37,894
<i>And call me. Anytime.</i>

2262
02:41:38,689 --> 02:41:39,689
I will.

2263
02:41:39,732 --> 02:41:41,143
<i>And, Bill...</i>

2264
02:41:46,780 --> 02:41:48,112
I love you, man.

2265
02:41:48,949 --> 02:41:50,235
I love you, too.

2266
02:41:50,910 --> 02:41:53,323
<i>All right. See you around.</i>

2267
02:42:20,314 --> 02:42:21,771
<i>Dear Losers...</i>

2268
02:42:22,858 --> 02:42:24,770
<i>I know what this must seem like...</i>

2269
02:42:24,818 --> 02:42:26,605
<i>but this isn't a suicide note.</i>

2270
02:42:28,614 --> 02:42:31,106
<i>You're probably wondering
why I did what I did.</i>

2271
02:42:32,326 --> 02:42:35,490
<i>It's because I knew I was too scared
to go back.</i>

2272
02:42:35,537 --> 02:42:37,574
<i>And if we weren't together...</i>

2273
02:42:37,623 --> 02:42:40,787
<i>if all of us alive weren't united...</i>

2274
02:42:40,834 --> 02:42:42,575
<i>I knew we'd all die.</i>

2275
02:42:43,212 --> 02:42:47,456
<i>So, I made the only logical move.</i>

2276
02:42:47,508 --> 02:42:49,340
<i>I took myself off the board.</i>

2277
02:42:51,637 --> 02:42:52,844
<i>Did it work?</i>

2278
02:42:53,639 --> 02:42:56,632
<i>Well, if you're reading this,
you know the answer.</i>

2279
02:42:59,270 --> 02:43:01,136
<i>I lived my whole life afraid.</i>

2280
02:43:03,065 --> 02:43:05,853
<i>Afraid of what would come next.</i>

2281
02:43:07,236 --> 02:43:09,148
<i>Afraid of what I might leave behind.</i>

2282
02:43:12,032 --> 02:43:13,113
<i>Don't.</i>

2283
02:43:15,119 --> 02:43:17,281
<i>Be who you want to be.</i>

2284
02:43:18,580 --> 02:43:19,866
<i>Be proud.</i>

2285
02:43:20,958 --> 02:43:22,449
Sleep okay?

2286
02:43:22,501 --> 02:43:23,501
Yeah.

2287
02:43:24,920 --> 02:43:26,377
I had a beautiful dream.

2288
02:43:27,256 --> 02:43:29,748
<i>And if you find someone worth
holding on to...</i>

2289
02:43:31,093 --> 02:43:33,710
<i>never ever let them go.</i>

2290
02:43:42,646 --> 02:43:44,182
<i>Follow your own path.</i>

2291
02:43:48,861 --> 02:43:50,227
<i>Wherever that takes you.</i>

2292
02:43:56,827 --> 02:43:59,991
<i>Think of this letter as a promise.</i>

2293
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:04,957
<i>A promise
I'm asking you to make.</i>

2294
02:44:06,378 --> 02:44:07,378
<i>To me.</i>

2295
02:44:08,505 --> 02:44:09,871
<i>To each other.</i>

2296
02:44:12,051 --> 02:44:13,167
<i>An oath.</i>

2297
02:44:17,222 --> 02:44:19,062
<i>See, the thing
about being a Loser...</i>

2298
02:44:21,894 --> 02:44:23,760
<i>is you don't have anything to lose.</i>

2299
02:44:26,732 --> 02:44:27,732
<i>So...</i>

2300
02:44:28,734 --> 02:44:29,734
<i>Be true.</i>

2301
02:44:30,652 --> 02:44:31,652
<i>Be brave.</i>

2302
02:44:32,946 --> 02:44:33,946
<i>Stand.</i>

2303
02:44:34,907 --> 02:44:35,907
<i>Believe.</i>

2304
02:44:36,950 --> 02:44:39,033
<i>And don't ever forget...</i>

2305
02:44:40,412 --> 02:44:41,652
<i>We're Losers...</i>

2306
02:44:43,082 --> 02:44:44,823
<i>and we always will be.</i>
