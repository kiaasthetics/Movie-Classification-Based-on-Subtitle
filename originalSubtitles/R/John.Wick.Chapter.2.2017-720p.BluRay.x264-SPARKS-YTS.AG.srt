1
00:03:38,078 --> 00:03:39,637
Almost.

2
00:03:39,718 --> 00:03:41,550
"Almost."

3
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:45,477
Sir, with all due respect,
are you sure this is our best option?

4
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,746
Why can't we just
correct the problem?

5
00:03:47,748 --> 00:03:49,598
Because my fuckin' nephew...

6
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:52,358
killed a dog.

7
00:03:54,078 --> 00:03:55,432
And he stole a car.

8
00:03:56,718 --> 00:03:58,118
A car...

9
00:03:59,278 --> 00:04:02,237
which currently is among our inventory.

10
00:04:06,478 --> 00:04:09,277
So we're giving
everything up for a car?

11
00:04:11,198 --> 00:04:12,632
It's not just a car.

12
00:04:13,638 --> 00:04:15,948
It is John Wick's car.

13
00:04:17,638 --> 00:04:19,038
Oh.

14
00:04:26,158 --> 00:04:28,150
Sir, why don't we just give it back?

15
00:04:29,358 --> 00:04:31,270
He killed my nephew.

16
00:04:33,078 --> 00:04:34,148
My brother.

17
00:04:36,158 --> 00:04:38,036
And a dozen of my men.

18
00:04:40,358 --> 00:04:42,270
Over his car.

19
00:04:43,558 --> 00:04:44,912
And a puppy.

20
00:04:48,078 --> 00:04:51,788
And you...
you think he will stop now?

21
00:04:51,878 --> 00:04:53,153
Hmm?

22
00:04:56,118 --> 00:04:57,950
Sir, he's one man.

23
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,517
Why don't we just eliminate him?

24
00:05:04,998 --> 00:05:06,432
John Wick...

25
00:05:06,518 --> 00:05:08,953
is a man of focus...

26
00:05:13,158 --> 00:05:14,433
commitment...

27
00:05:21,438 --> 00:05:24,272
and sheer fuckin' will.

28
00:05:40,638 --> 00:05:42,357
He once killed three
men in a bar...

29
00:05:42,438 --> 00:05:44,828
With a pencil. I know.
I've heard the story.

30
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:46,477
With a fucking pencil!

31
00:05:47,718 --> 00:05:49,391
Who the fuck can do that?

32
00:05:51,878 --> 00:05:53,392
Well, I can assure you

33
00:05:55,198 --> 00:05:58,236
that the stories you
hear about this man,

34
00:05:59,238 --> 00:06:05,314
if nothing else,
has been watered down.

35
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,027
...Mr. Wick.

36
00:15:48,398 --> 00:15:49,593
Hey, buddy.

37
00:15:56,838 --> 00:15:57,838
Hey.

38
00:16:05,918 --> 00:16:07,147
Good dog.

39
00:16:22,718 --> 00:16:25,074
- What are you doing, John?
- Looking at you.

40
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:27,307
What are you doing?

41
00:16:27,398 --> 00:16:28,798
I'm waiting for you.

42
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:30,988
Come here.

43
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:47,788
Hey, boy.

44
00:17:13,278 --> 00:17:14,951
Nice peaceful place you got here.

45
00:17:16,358 --> 00:17:18,077
- Hey, Aurelio.
- Hey.

46
00:17:22,598 --> 00:17:25,909
John, what the hell?
I thought you loved this car.

47
00:17:26,918 --> 00:17:28,193
What do you think?

48
00:17:28,278 --> 00:17:30,747
Well, your motor's
about to fall out and...

49
00:17:31,758 --> 00:17:32,874
the chassis' all bent up,

50
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,950
the... the driveshaft is all destroyed.

51
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:38,878
And I don't know if you noticed,
but you got a crack in your windshield.

52
00:17:39,838 --> 00:17:42,194
I mean...
what do I think?

53
00:17:43,718 --> 00:17:45,118
I could fix this.

54
00:17:46,718 --> 00:17:48,072
Thanks for finding her.

55
00:17:48,158 --> 00:17:51,276
Not a problem, man.
I just made a few calls. No big deal.

56
00:17:54,158 --> 00:17:55,592
Let me know when it's fixed.

57
00:17:56,758 --> 00:18:00,229
All right.
It'll be ready Christmas...

58
00:18:00,318 --> 00:18:01,672
2030.

59
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:41,798
Ciao, John.

60
00:19:43,518 --> 00:19:44,518
Santino.

61
00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:04,634
Café?

62
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:06,867
Grazie.

63
00:20:11,198 --> 00:20:12,234
Good to see you.

64
00:20:13,238 --> 00:20:14,558
Good to see you.

65
00:20:34,638 --> 00:20:36,948
I was sorry to hear
about your wife, John.

66
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,558
Thank you.

67
00:20:42,518 --> 00:20:43,518
Hi.

68
00:20:46,638 --> 00:20:49,198
And the dog, does he have a name?

69
00:20:50,398 --> 00:20:51,468
No.

70
00:21:00,678 --> 00:21:04,388
Listen, John... with all sincerity...

71
00:21:06,478 --> 00:21:07,798
I don't want to be here.

72
00:21:07,878 --> 00:21:09,551
Please, don't.

73
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:12,470
I'm asking you not to do this.

74
00:21:13,478 --> 00:21:14,628
I'm sorry.

75
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:25,309
No one gets out and comes back
without repercussions.

76
00:21:27,358 --> 00:21:29,998
I do this with a heavy heart, John.

77
00:21:33,478 --> 00:21:37,074
But remember, if not for what I did

78
00:21:37,158 --> 00:21:40,230
on the night of your impossible task,

79
00:21:40,358 --> 00:21:44,318
you wouldn't be here
right now, like this.

80
00:21:44,398 --> 00:21:47,311
This is because of me.

81
00:21:47,398 --> 00:21:48,912
This, in part, is mine.

82
00:21:49,918 --> 00:21:52,069
Take it back.

83
00:21:52,158 --> 00:21:53,438
- "Take it back"?
- Take it back.

84
00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:57,112
A marker is no small thing, John.

85
00:21:58,198 --> 00:22:00,508
For a man to grant a marker to another,

86
00:22:01,598 --> 00:22:04,113
is to bind a soul to a blood oath.

87
00:22:08,238 --> 00:22:10,116
Find someone else.

88
00:22:13,878 --> 00:22:15,312
Listen to me.

89
00:22:15,398 --> 00:22:16,798
What is this? Hmm?

90
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:20,267
Do you remember? This is your blood.

91
00:22:21,478 --> 00:22:24,312
You came to me.
I helped you.

92
00:22:25,518 --> 00:22:28,158
If you don't do this,

93
00:22:28,238 --> 00:22:30,514
you know the consequences.

94
00:22:32,638 --> 00:22:34,595
I'm not that guy anymore.

95
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:41,075
You are always that guy, John.

96
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:47,232
I can't help you.

97
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:00,878
I'm sorry.

98
00:23:14,078 --> 00:23:16,547
Yes. You're right.

99
00:23:17,638 --> 00:23:18,708
You can't.

100
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:24,156
But he can.

101
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:25,877
I'll see you soon, John.

102
00:23:37,998 --> 00:23:40,513
You have a beautiful home, John.

103
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:44,073
Buenasera.

104
00:25:57,518 --> 00:25:59,475
Well, good evenin', John.

105
00:26:00,478 --> 00:26:01,753
Hey, Jimmy.

106
00:26:04,118 --> 00:26:05,438
Gas leak?

107
00:26:07,478 --> 00:26:09,037
Yeah, gas leak.

108
00:26:10,718 --> 00:26:12,277
You workin' again?

109
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:16,592
I'll see you, Jimmy.

110
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:18,798
Come on, boy.

111
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:24,472
'Night, John.

112
00:26:26,758 --> 00:26:28,192
Oh, shit.

113
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,750
I'd like to see the manager.

114
00:27:13,838 --> 00:27:16,558
How good to see you
again so soon, Mr. Wick.

115
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:18,833
Shall I announce you?

116
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,192
Yes, please.

117
00:27:22,318 --> 00:27:23,672
Stay.

118
00:27:31,518 --> 00:27:34,033
Mr. Wick is on his
way to see you, sir.

119
00:27:47,358 --> 00:27:48,587
Impeccable.

120
00:27:51,118 --> 00:27:53,758
Put these into circulation.

121
00:28:07,598 --> 00:28:08,793
Where is he?

122
00:28:10,678 --> 00:28:12,556
Thank you, my friend.

123
00:28:12,638 --> 00:28:14,709
Beautiful work. Beautiful.

124
00:28:21,998 --> 00:28:23,637
What are you doing, Jonathan?

125
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:27,234
He burned my house down.

126
00:28:27,318 --> 00:28:30,516
You rejected his marker.
You're lucky he stopped there.

127
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:34,086
What the hell were you
thinking,

128
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:36,151
giving a marker to a man
like Santino D'Antonio?

129
00:28:36,238 --> 00:28:38,798
It was the only way I could get out.

130
00:28:38,878 --> 00:28:41,791
Oh. You call this "out"?

131
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,914
What did you think was
gonna happen? Huh?

132
00:28:45,998 --> 00:28:47,796
What did you expect? Huh?

133
00:28:47,878 --> 00:28:51,508
Did you really think this day
was never going to come? Hmm?

134
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:55,637
What does he want you to do?

135
00:28:57,798 --> 00:28:59,118
I didn't ask.

136
00:29:00,118 --> 00:29:01,313
I just said no.

137
00:29:04,438 --> 00:29:07,033
Two rules that cannot
be broken, Jonathan.

138
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:12,032
No blood on Continental grounds,
and every marker must be honored.

139
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:16,794
Now while my judgment comes
in the form of excommunicado,

140
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:19,676
the High Table

141
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,910
demand a more severe outcome
if their traditions are refused.

142
00:29:24,478 --> 00:29:26,151
I have no choice?

143
00:29:27,478 --> 00:29:29,390
You dishonor the marker, you die.

144
00:29:29,478 --> 00:29:31,595
You kill the holder of the marker,
you die.

145
00:29:31,678 --> 00:29:33,829
You run, you die.

146
00:29:35,358 --> 00:29:37,475
This is what you agreed to, Jonathan.

147
00:29:38,478 --> 00:29:40,151
Do what the man asks.

148
00:29:41,478 --> 00:29:42,753
Be free.

149
00:29:42,838 --> 00:29:47,993
Then, if you want to go after him,
burn his house down, be my guest.

150
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,398
But until then...

151
00:29:52,158 --> 00:29:53,308
Rules.

152
00:29:54,318 --> 00:29:57,311
Exactly. Rules.

153
00:29:57,438 --> 00:29:59,669
Without them, we'd
live with the animals.

154
00:30:08,198 --> 00:30:09,552
Do you board?

155
00:30:10,838 --> 00:30:13,876
I'm sorry to say, sir,
but this facility does not.

156
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:21,316
I, however, would be willing to accept
the responsibility, should you wish.

157
00:30:22,958 --> 00:30:24,358
Appreciate that.

158
00:30:24,438 --> 00:30:26,157
Does he have a name, sir?

159
00:30:26,238 --> 00:30:27,238
No.

160
00:30:27,318 --> 00:30:29,469
Good dog.

161
00:30:29,598 --> 00:30:30,598
Stay.

162
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:37,352
This was my father's collection.

163
00:31:38,638 --> 00:31:42,154
I see little more
than just paint on canvas, of course.

164
00:31:44,478 --> 00:31:46,435
But I do find myself here.

165
00:31:48,318 --> 00:31:49,672
Please.

166
00:32:02,678 --> 00:32:03,998
I didn't want to do this, John.

167
00:32:04,998 --> 00:32:08,514
Had you stayed retired,
I would have respected it.

168
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:11,708
Look at you.

169
00:32:12,878 --> 00:32:15,074
You're thinkin' about it, aren't you?

170
00:32:16,358 --> 00:32:19,829
You're counting exits... guards...

171
00:32:21,678 --> 00:32:23,510
Could you get to me in time?

172
00:32:25,838 --> 00:32:27,636
How would you do it, I wonder?

173
00:32:29,878 --> 00:32:30,878
That woman's pen?

174
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:34,398
His cane?

175
00:32:36,678 --> 00:32:37,873
Maybe his glasses?

176
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,557
My hands.

177
00:32:41,678 --> 00:32:44,955
Ah. How exciting.

178
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:47,677
Yet you know you cannot, can you?

179
00:32:48,998 --> 00:32:52,753
I told you I needed that guy,

180
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:55,148
the way you are looking
at me right now.

181
00:32:56,278 --> 00:32:58,747
I needed the Boogeyman.

182
00:32:58,838 --> 00:33:00,318
I needed John Wick.

183
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:03,311
Just... tell me what you want.

184
00:33:08,678 --> 00:33:11,193
I want you to kill my sister.

185
00:33:13,198 --> 00:33:14,552
Why?

186
00:33:14,678 --> 00:33:17,955
There are 12 seats at the High Table.

187
00:33:19,558 --> 00:33:22,198
Camorra, Mafia, and 'Ndrangheta.

188
00:33:24,118 --> 00:33:26,110
The Chinese, the Russian.

189
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:29,475
When my father died...

190
00:33:31,078 --> 00:33:33,195
he willed his seat to her.

191
00:33:34,878 --> 00:33:37,791
She represents Camorra now.

192
00:33:37,878 --> 00:33:40,234
And I can't help but wonder...

193
00:33:41,638 --> 00:33:44,153
what I might accomplish in her stead.

194
00:33:45,998 --> 00:33:51,471
You want me to kill...
Gianna D'Antonio?

195
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,393
I could never do it.

196
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:58,071
She is my blood.

197
00:33:58,158 --> 00:33:59,228
I still love her.

198
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:01,797
It can't be done.

199
00:34:01,878 --> 00:34:05,428
She's in Rome for her coronation.

200
00:34:06,438 --> 00:34:10,955
- You will take the catacombs in...
- It doesn't matter where she is.

201
00:34:11,038 --> 00:34:16,193
That's why I need the ghost,
lo spettro, John Wick.

202
00:34:17,198 --> 00:34:18,996
That's why I need you.

203
00:34:20,118 --> 00:34:21,347
Do this for me,

204
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:24,270
and your marker is honored.

205
00:34:25,638 --> 00:34:27,277
What say you?

206
00:34:35,078 --> 00:34:36,910
Never one to waste words.

207
00:34:53,478 --> 00:34:55,947
Fifty-nine, zero, 3.5.

208
00:36:59,118 --> 00:37:00,518
Jonathan!

209
00:37:01,918 --> 00:37:03,272
Julius.

210
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:07,236
- Ciao.
- Nice to see you.

211
00:37:13,038 --> 00:37:16,236
I fail to recall the last time
you were in Rome.

212
00:37:17,558 --> 00:37:18,787
And here I'd heard

213
00:37:19,798 --> 00:37:21,027
you had retired.

214
00:37:22,598 --> 00:37:23,793
I had.

215
00:37:25,038 --> 00:37:28,554
Then humor me with, uh...
but one question.

216
00:37:38,638 --> 00:37:39,788
No.

217
00:37:42,238 --> 00:37:43,433
All right, then.

218
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:51,996
One of our finest rooms.

219
00:37:56,638 --> 00:37:57,754
Grazie.

220
00:37:59,038 --> 00:38:00,518
Enjoy your stay.

221
00:38:08,038 --> 00:38:09,038
Mr. Wick.

222
00:38:28,518 --> 00:38:30,077
Is the sommelier in?

223
00:38:30,158 --> 00:38:32,036
I have never known him not to be.

224
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:49,757
Good afternoon, Mr. Wick.

225
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:52,633
It's been a long time.

226
00:38:52,718 --> 00:38:54,277
I'd like a tasting.

227
00:38:54,358 --> 00:38:57,351
I am quite excited to
show you something.

228
00:38:58,798 --> 00:38:59,798
First...

229
00:39:05,918 --> 00:39:08,194
Buongiorno, Signor Wick.

230
00:39:08,278 --> 00:39:09,278
Ciao, Angelo.

231
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:10,792
Welcome back to Rome.

232
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:14,718
I am.

233
00:39:14,798 --> 00:39:17,870
I know of your past fondness
for the German varietals,

234
00:39:17,998 --> 00:39:22,151
but I can wholeheartedly endorse
the new breed of Austrians.

235
00:39:23,158 --> 00:39:25,878
Glock.34 and.26.

236
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:29,678
This is the original map
of the D'Antonio estate.

237
00:39:29,758 --> 00:39:32,227
Here, you have all the ancient ruins.

238
00:39:34,878 --> 00:39:38,758
Tell me, Mr. Wick, is this a
formal event or a social affair?

239
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:42,718
- Social.
- And is this for day or evening?

240
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:45,029
I need one for day and one for night.

241
00:39:45,118 --> 00:39:46,347
Recontoured grips.

242
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:50,430
Flared magwell for easier reloads.

243
00:39:50,518 --> 00:39:52,908
And I know you'll appreciate
the custom porting.

244
00:39:55,878 --> 00:39:57,392
What's next?

245
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:01,108
I need something robust. Precise.

246
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:04,032
"Robust. Precise."

247
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:10,712
This is the map of the temple
and catacombs underneath.

248
00:40:10,798 --> 00:40:12,517
- In what style?
- Italian.

249
00:40:12,638 --> 00:40:14,197
- How many buttons?
- Two.

250
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:15,951
- Trousers?
- Tapered.

251
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,233
How about the lining?

252
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:18,911
Tactical.

253
00:40:20,238 --> 00:40:24,073
AR-15, 11.5-inch.

254
00:40:24,158 --> 00:40:27,071
Compensated
with an ion-bonded bolt carrier.

255
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:30,117
Trijicon accupoint
with one-six magnification.

256
00:40:30,238 --> 00:40:34,312
And this is the modern blueprint.

257
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:37,709
There are one, two, three gates.

258
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:43,277
Silicon carbide discs.
Ceramic matrices.

259
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:44,997
Accompanying laminates.

260
00:40:45,078 --> 00:40:46,831
Cutting-edge body armor.

261
00:40:46,918 --> 00:40:50,594
We just sew it between the fabric
and the lining.

262
00:40:50,718 --> 00:40:53,358
Zero penetration.
However...

263
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,152
quite painful, I'm afraid.

264
00:40:56,238 --> 00:40:59,595
Could you recommend anything
for the end of the night?

265
00:40:59,678 --> 00:41:01,795
Something big, bold.

266
00:41:01,878 --> 00:41:05,269
May I suggest the Benelli M4?

267
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:11,875
Custom bolt carrier release
and charging handle.

268
00:41:12,878 --> 00:41:16,155
Textured grips, should
your hands get... wet.

269
00:41:19,198 --> 00:41:21,110
An Italian classic.

270
00:41:21,198 --> 00:41:22,234
Dessert?

271
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:24,435
Dessert.

272
00:41:25,438 --> 00:41:29,227
The finest cutlery.
All freshly stoned.

273
00:41:38,838 --> 00:41:40,238
Well done.

274
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:42,310
- Could you do a rush order?
- I sure can.

275
00:41:42,398 --> 00:41:44,196
Where would you like to have it sent?

276
00:41:44,278 --> 00:41:45,314
The hotel.

277
00:41:45,438 --> 00:41:47,118
Shall I have everything
sent to your room?

278
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,314
- Yes. Thank you.
- Excellent.

279
00:41:51,918 --> 00:41:53,113
Mr. Wick?

280
00:41:56,758 --> 00:41:58,636
Do enjoy your party.

281
00:45:53,238 --> 00:45:54,238
Good evening.

282
00:45:55,358 --> 00:45:57,111
Are you enjoying the party?

283
00:46:45,478 --> 00:46:46,958
Mr. Akoni.

284
00:46:52,358 --> 00:46:54,350
Are you enjoying the festivities?

285
00:46:58,558 --> 00:47:00,390
Please. Sit.

286
00:47:04,798 --> 00:47:06,517
Ms. D'Antonio,

287
00:47:06,598 --> 00:47:08,794
you can't just take
what is rightfully mine...

288
00:47:08,878 --> 00:47:10,073
Nothing was taken.

289
00:47:11,238 --> 00:47:14,675
Those among your own
came to us with these territories.

290
00:47:14,758 --> 00:47:16,317
A knife was pressed to their throats.

291
00:47:17,318 --> 00:47:18,318
Semantics.

292
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:20,388
Besides...

293
00:47:21,398 --> 00:47:24,709
That blade you speak of was meant
for their children.

294
00:47:26,038 --> 00:47:28,394
They were only meant to watch.

295
00:47:29,518 --> 00:47:33,194
What is yours is now ours,
Mr. Akoni.

296
00:47:35,278 --> 00:47:36,428
Now go.

297
00:47:39,558 --> 00:47:40,958
Enjoy the party.

298
00:47:42,478 --> 00:47:43,992
Have some fun.

299
00:47:55,238 --> 00:47:56,752
Sì, signora.

300
00:48:42,718 --> 00:48:43,947
John.

301
00:48:45,878 --> 00:48:47,028
Gianna.

302
00:48:53,318 --> 00:48:58,632
There was a time not so long ago
in which I considered us as friends.

303
00:49:02,358 --> 00:49:03,678
I still do.

304
00:49:07,438 --> 00:49:08,633
Yet here you are.

305
00:49:15,878 --> 00:49:17,949
What brought you back, John?

306
00:49:19,398 --> 00:49:20,798
A marker.

307
00:49:22,878 --> 00:49:23,948
Held by?

308
00:49:26,398 --> 00:49:27,832
Your brother.

309
00:49:35,758 --> 00:49:36,987
Tell me, John.

310
00:49:37,998 --> 00:49:39,512
This marker...

311
00:49:41,038 --> 00:49:42,552
Is it how you got out?

312
00:49:45,398 --> 00:49:46,468
And what was her name,

313
00:49:47,478 --> 00:49:50,118
this woman whose life has ended my own?

314
00:49:52,718 --> 00:49:53,993
Helen.

315
00:49:55,038 --> 00:49:56,188
"Helen."

316
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:00,872
This Helen...

317
00:50:02,798 --> 00:50:05,870
was she worth the price
that you now seek to pay?

318
00:50:12,838 --> 00:50:14,238
Now...

319
00:50:16,798 --> 00:50:19,233
let me tell you what
happens when I die.

320
00:50:20,238 --> 00:50:23,390
Santino will lay claim
to my seat at the Table.

321
00:50:24,758 --> 00:50:26,511
He will take New York.

322
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:32,916
And you... will have been
the one who gifted it to him.

323
00:51:23,478 --> 00:51:25,788
What would your Helen
think about that, John?

324
00:51:45,118 --> 00:51:47,508
What would your Helen think about you?

325
00:51:48,518 --> 00:51:49,634
Hmm?

326
00:52:04,838 --> 00:52:06,113
Why?

327
00:52:11,518 --> 00:52:13,077
Because...

328
00:52:13,158 --> 00:52:16,390
I lived my life my way.

329
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:20,109
And I'll die my way.

330
00:52:35,158 --> 00:52:37,912
Do you fear damnation, John?

331
00:52:39,958 --> 00:52:41,108
Yes.

332
00:52:47,918 --> 00:52:49,147
You know,

333
00:52:50,158 --> 00:52:53,674
I always thought I could escape it.

334
00:52:55,638 --> 00:52:57,675
That I'd see it coming.

335
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,235
That I'd see you.

336
00:54:15,958 --> 00:54:17,108
John?

337
00:54:22,838 --> 00:54:24,158
Cassian.

338
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:27,708
You working?

339
00:54:30,238 --> 00:54:32,036
Yeah.

340
00:54:32,118 --> 00:54:33,118
You?

341
00:54:34,558 --> 00:54:35,708
Yeah.

342
00:54:39,158 --> 00:54:40,308
Good night?

343
00:54:43,078 --> 00:54:44,398
Afraid so.

344
00:54:46,598 --> 00:54:48,157
I'm sorry to hear that.

345
00:57:50,158 --> 00:57:51,558
Loose ends?

346
00:57:59,118 --> 00:58:00,438
Yeah...

347
01:02:22,758 --> 01:02:24,558
You're not havin' a good night,
are you, John?

348
01:04:50,358 --> 01:04:51,358
Gentlemen!

349
01:04:53,878 --> 01:04:54,994
Gentlemen!

350
01:05:07,238 --> 01:05:08,991
Do I need to remind you

351
01:05:09,078 --> 01:05:10,717
that there will be no business

352
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:13,358
conducted on the Continental grounds?

353
01:05:14,838 --> 01:05:15,874
No, signore.

354
01:05:17,118 --> 01:05:18,313
No, sir.

355
01:05:20,118 --> 01:05:21,118
Bene.

356
01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:27,557
Now, may I suggest a visit to the bar,

357
01:05:27,638 --> 01:05:29,118
so you can calm yourselves.

358
01:05:33,558 --> 01:05:35,117
Gin, wasn't it?

359
01:05:36,158 --> 01:05:37,308
Yes.

360
01:05:38,838 --> 01:05:41,672
Bourbon, right?

361
01:05:43,118 --> 01:05:44,188
Yeah.

362
01:06:10,838 --> 01:06:12,352
I had a marker.

363
01:06:14,398 --> 01:06:15,548
Whose?

364
01:06:16,678 --> 01:06:18,158
Her brother.

365
01:06:23,318 --> 01:06:24,468
I see.

366
01:06:26,198 --> 01:06:27,871
You had no choice.

367
01:06:32,598 --> 01:06:34,954
He wants her seat at the Table.

368
01:06:36,718 --> 01:06:38,357
He will get it now.

369
01:06:41,358 --> 01:06:42,553
Yeah.

370
01:06:44,198 --> 01:06:45,348
Yeah.

371
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:49,107
So you're free.

372
01:06:56,238 --> 01:06:57,388
Am I?

373
01:06:59,918 --> 01:07:00,954
No.

374
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:04,318
Not at all.

375
01:07:06,718 --> 01:07:11,076
You killed my ward.
Someone I was close to.

376
01:07:13,398 --> 01:07:14,912
An eye for an eye, John.

377
01:07:16,478 --> 01:07:17,992
You know how it goes.

378
01:07:20,398 --> 01:07:21,434
Yeah.

379
01:07:27,798 --> 01:07:29,517
I'll make it quick.

380
01:07:30,678 --> 01:07:32,158
I promise.

381
01:07:34,118 --> 01:07:35,791
I appreciate that.

382
01:07:36,958 --> 01:07:39,029
I'll try and do the same.

383
01:07:48,678 --> 01:07:49,998
This round's on me.

384
01:07:53,118 --> 01:07:55,428
Consider it a professional courtesy.

385
01:08:29,478 --> 01:08:31,709
No. Thanks.

386
01:09:34,518 --> 01:09:36,510
Hello, John.

387
01:09:36,598 --> 01:09:38,874
I understand if you're upset.

388
01:09:38,958 --> 01:09:41,678
And I know it might feel personal.

389
01:09:41,758 --> 01:09:44,034
But what kind of man would I be

390
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:45,877
if I didn't avenge my sister's murder?

391
01:09:47,798 --> 01:09:48,948
John?

392
01:10:05,718 --> 01:10:09,234
Could you let management know
I'll be checking out in the morning.

393
01:10:47,638 --> 01:10:50,278
Operator.
How may I direct your call?

394
01:10:50,358 --> 01:10:52,634
- Accounts payable.
- One moment, please.

395
01:11:05,438 --> 01:11:06,438
Accounts payable.

396
01:11:06,518 --> 01:11:07,668
How may I help you?

397
01:11:07,758 --> 01:11:09,033
I'd like to open an account.

398
01:11:09,158 --> 01:11:11,548
- Name on the account?
- John Wick.

399
01:11:11,638 --> 01:11:13,277
Verification?

400
01:11:13,358 --> 01:11:15,190
9305-05.

401
01:11:16,998 --> 01:11:18,318
State of contract?

402
01:11:18,398 --> 01:11:21,197
- Open.
- Denomination?

403
01:11:22,958 --> 01:11:23,958
Seven million.

404
01:11:24,038 --> 01:11:26,155
Processing. Please hold.

405
01:11:29,238 --> 01:11:32,197
- I appreciate the service.
- My pleasure.

406
01:11:32,278 --> 01:11:34,509
You will find safe passage below.

407
01:11:38,518 --> 01:11:40,316
Transportation is waiting for you.

408
01:11:41,878 --> 01:11:46,555
May you have a safe journey,
Mr. Wick.

409
01:13:17,838 --> 01:13:18,988
Order confirmed.

410
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:25,113
- What is this?
- He completed the task.

411
01:13:26,118 --> 01:13:28,189
The marker is over.

412
01:13:29,198 --> 01:13:30,198
Mark it.

413
01:13:30,278 --> 01:13:34,033
If Mr. Wick isn't
dead already,

414
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:35,438
he soon will be.

415
01:13:37,958 --> 01:13:40,678
Will you mark it, sir?

416
01:13:54,158 --> 01:13:57,754
You have no idea what's coming, do you?

417
01:13:59,878 --> 01:14:03,110
I have everyone in New York
looking for him.

418
01:14:03,198 --> 01:14:05,508
I doubt we will see him again.

419
01:14:08,358 --> 01:14:09,712
Do you now?

420
01:14:11,638 --> 01:14:14,358
You stabbed the devil in the back

421
01:14:14,438 --> 01:14:17,670
and forced him back
into the life that he had just left.

422
01:14:19,678 --> 01:14:22,398
You incinerated the priest's temple.

423
01:14:22,518 --> 01:14:23,668
Burned it to the ground.

424
01:14:25,358 --> 01:14:28,715
Now he's free of the marker,
what do you think he'll do?

425
01:14:31,438 --> 01:14:33,998
He had a glimpse of the other side

426
01:14:34,078 --> 01:14:35,637
and he embraced it.

427
01:14:35,718 --> 01:14:37,596
But you, Signor D'Antonio...

428
01:14:38,878 --> 01:14:39,994
took it away from him.

429
01:14:41,038 --> 01:14:42,472
He was already back.

430
01:14:42,558 --> 01:14:45,153
Oh, he came back for love, not for you.

431
01:14:45,238 --> 01:14:47,707
He owed me.
I had every right.

432
01:14:48,718 --> 01:14:51,711
And now he's coming again.

433
01:14:53,958 --> 01:14:55,358
He did tell you not to do this.

434
01:14:58,838 --> 01:15:00,033
He did warn you.

435
01:15:01,598 --> 01:15:03,078
Addio, Santino.

436
01:19:07,758 --> 01:19:11,798
Please notify MTA personnel of
any suspicious activity.

437
01:19:19,798 --> 01:19:21,676
Your attention, please.

438
01:19:21,758 --> 01:19:25,229
The Broad Street bound C train
is now arriving.

439
01:19:26,718 --> 01:19:28,152
Your attention, please.

440
01:19:28,238 --> 01:19:31,595
The Broad Street bound C train
is now arriving.

441
01:19:45,118 --> 01:19:47,314
Next stop, Canal Street.

442
01:20:07,838 --> 01:20:09,477
This is Canal Street.

443
01:20:11,798 --> 01:20:15,348
This is the Broad Street bound C train.

444
01:20:15,438 --> 01:20:17,748
Next stop is Rector Street.

445
01:20:42,918 --> 01:20:44,910
This is Rector Street.

446
01:20:49,918 --> 01:20:52,797
This is the Broad Street bound C train.

447
01:20:53,878 --> 01:20:56,154
The next stop is Broad Street.

448
01:22:19,318 --> 01:22:21,674
This is Broad Street.

449
01:22:21,758 --> 01:22:24,432
This is the last stop
on the southbound C train.

450
01:22:24,518 --> 01:22:26,714
The blade is in your aorta.

451
01:22:26,798 --> 01:22:28,994
You pull it out, you will bleed,
and you will die.

452
01:22:29,998 --> 01:22:31,478
This is the end of the line.

453
01:22:34,918 --> 01:22:37,274
Consider this a professional courtesy.

454
01:22:38,438 --> 01:22:40,270
This is Broad Street.

455
01:22:40,358 --> 01:22:43,476
This is the last stop
on the southbound C train.

456
01:22:45,478 --> 01:22:47,276
This is the end of the line.

457
01:23:22,798 --> 01:23:26,428
We see things, we see things.

458
01:23:26,518 --> 01:23:29,795
The things you see are nightmares, man.

459
01:23:29,878 --> 01:23:31,949
Like this one time...

460
01:23:35,438 --> 01:23:36,792
Take me to him.

461
01:23:39,958 --> 01:23:41,950
Tell him it's John Wick.

462
01:23:58,038 --> 01:24:00,997
You know, they just...
they put it in everything!

463
01:24:01,078 --> 01:24:02,273
Hey, man. You got a quarter?

464
01:25:53,998 --> 01:25:55,955
As I live and breathe!

465
01:25:57,118 --> 01:25:58,598
John Wick.

466
01:25:59,598 --> 01:26:00,598
The man.

467
01:26:01,598 --> 01:26:03,112
The myth.

468
01:26:03,198 --> 01:26:04,427
The legend.

469
01:26:05,718 --> 01:26:08,995
You're not very good at retiring.

470
01:26:09,078 --> 01:26:10,751
I'm workin' on it.

471
01:26:11,918 --> 01:26:15,389
Mr. Wick doesn't remember,
but we met many years ago,

472
01:26:15,478 --> 01:26:17,276
before my ascension...

473
01:26:18,638 --> 01:26:21,198
When I was just a pawn in the game.

474
01:26:23,038 --> 01:26:25,758
We met and you gave me a gift,

475
01:26:25,838 --> 01:26:27,591
the gift that would make me a king.

476
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:33,390
You don't remember, but there I was,
standing in an alleyway.

477
01:26:34,998 --> 01:26:36,637
I didn't even hear you comin'.

478
01:26:40,118 --> 01:26:42,474
You gave me this.

479
01:26:46,718 --> 01:26:48,357
Gift from the Boogeyman.

480
01:26:49,358 --> 01:26:51,873
Perfect for every occasion.

481
01:26:54,558 --> 01:26:56,754
But you also gave me a choice.

482
01:26:57,878 --> 01:27:01,713
Pull my gun,
shoot you in the back, and die,

483
01:27:01,798 --> 01:27:03,994
or keep the pressure on my neck...

484
01:27:05,638 --> 01:27:06,674
and live.

485
01:27:08,918 --> 01:27:10,511
And so you see, I survived.

486
01:27:11,958 --> 01:27:15,793
No one sneaks up on me anymore,
thanks to you.

487
01:27:16,998 --> 01:27:20,469
I am all-seeing and all-knowing.

488
01:27:22,438 --> 01:27:24,589
Then you know why I'm here.

489
01:27:26,798 --> 01:27:29,677
Santino D'Antonio, yes.

490
01:27:29,758 --> 01:27:32,353
Your contract went wide, John.

491
01:27:33,438 --> 01:27:35,316
That's bad for your health.

492
01:27:36,318 --> 01:27:38,150
What's the number up to now, Earl?

493
01:27:39,478 --> 01:27:41,674
Seven million dollars!

494
01:27:41,758 --> 01:27:42,758
Damn!

495
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:46,951
It's Christmas.
We're going to Applebee's after this.

496
01:27:50,678 --> 01:27:52,874
I need your help.

497
01:27:52,958 --> 01:27:56,713
You have eyes begging for change
on every corner in the city.

498
01:27:56,798 --> 01:27:58,994
I'm thinkin' you can find Santino.

499
01:28:00,198 --> 01:28:03,077
I need you to move me.
Underground.

500
01:28:03,158 --> 01:28:04,433
Get me to him.

501
01:28:05,438 --> 01:28:07,953
How sweet it is!

502
01:28:08,958 --> 01:28:11,518
The Boogeyman begging me for help.

503
01:28:11,638 --> 01:28:13,436
Well, of course, John.

504
01:28:13,558 --> 01:28:16,118
Yes, John.
Whatever you'd like, John.

505
01:28:16,198 --> 01:28:18,952
Would you like a back
rub with that, John?

506
01:28:20,118 --> 01:28:21,677
You're going to help me.

507
01:28:22,958 --> 01:28:25,154
Why the fuck would I do that?

508
01:28:26,878 --> 01:28:29,347
Because I'm the only one
that can help you.

509
01:28:47,958 --> 01:28:49,358
You're gonna help me out?

510
01:28:50,478 --> 01:28:53,312
That's downright upright of you, Mr.
Wick.

511
01:28:54,358 --> 01:28:57,112
You sound positively magnanimous.

512
01:28:58,798 --> 01:29:00,471
But look around you.

513
01:29:00,558 --> 01:29:04,029
How much help does it look like I need?

514
01:29:12,918 --> 01:29:15,990
It seems to me that the
real question, Mr. Wick,

515
01:29:17,238 --> 01:29:21,278
is who in this cruel world of ours...
is going to help you?

516
01:29:36,158 --> 01:29:37,308
There's a storm coming.

517
01:29:37,398 --> 01:29:41,028
Not just for me.
For all of us.

518
01:29:41,118 --> 01:29:43,678
For everyone under the Table.

519
01:29:43,758 --> 01:29:47,468
Yes, killing someone who has a seat at
the High Table does create a problem.

520
01:29:47,558 --> 01:29:49,390
But it's your problem, baby.

521
01:29:49,478 --> 01:29:54,997
After all, none of my people
sent Gianna D'Antonio...

522
01:29:55,118 --> 01:29:56,711
to the hereafter.

523
01:29:58,238 --> 01:30:02,118
That being said, Santino
has her seat now.

524
01:30:03,118 --> 01:30:04,393
And he wants the city.

525
01:30:05,398 --> 01:30:08,470
When he's done uptown, you think
he's gonna stop at 14th Street?

526
01:30:09,478 --> 01:30:12,471
We'll just have to take
care of ourselves.

527
01:30:12,558 --> 01:30:13,753
Oh, yeah?

528
01:30:13,838 --> 01:30:16,228
For how long?

529
01:30:16,318 --> 01:30:17,638
And how much blood?

530
01:30:18,638 --> 01:30:20,357
You kill Santino,

531
01:30:20,438 --> 01:30:22,953
the Camorra,
and the High Table come for you.

532
01:30:24,278 --> 01:30:27,555
I kill Santino, they come for me.

533
01:30:28,918 --> 01:30:31,592
He's offered $7 million for your life.

534
01:30:32,598 --> 01:30:36,911
Seven million dollars
is a lot of money, Mr. Wick.

535
01:30:43,118 --> 01:30:45,075
So I guess you have a choice.

536
01:30:46,078 --> 01:30:47,876
You want a war?

537
01:30:47,958 --> 01:30:50,268
Or do you wanna just give me a gun?

538
01:30:59,798 --> 01:31:05,829
Somebody, please! Get this man a gun!

539
01:31:12,478 --> 01:31:15,391
Kimber 1911,.45 ACP.

540
01:31:17,798 --> 01:31:20,472
Seven-round capacity.

541
01:31:28,878 --> 01:31:30,073
Seven rounds?

542
01:31:31,078 --> 01:31:34,754
Seven million dollars
gets you seven rounds.

543
01:31:36,198 --> 01:31:38,315
That's a million dollars a round, baby.

544
01:31:50,038 --> 01:31:51,038
Let's go.

545
01:31:52,718 --> 01:31:55,358
Your descent into Hell
begins here, Mr. Wick.

546
01:31:55,438 --> 01:31:56,667
He's at the museum.

547
01:31:56,758 --> 01:31:58,397
Earl will guide you.

548
01:31:58,478 --> 01:32:00,709
Do be careful on your way down.

549
01:32:02,118 --> 01:32:05,748
Oh, and remember...
you owe me.

550
01:32:07,438 --> 01:32:09,236
You don't want me owing you.

551
01:32:39,318 --> 01:32:40,593
Welcome, everyone.

552
01:32:40,678 --> 01:32:43,830
Let us toast to the future
of the High Table

553
01:32:43,918 --> 01:32:47,070
and of course,
to the memory of my dear sister.

554
01:33:04,318 --> 01:33:06,037
Nice to see you.

555
01:33:15,958 --> 01:33:17,597
Mr. Akoni, how are you?

556
01:34:14,318 --> 01:34:16,037
Wick is here.

557
01:34:16,118 --> 01:34:17,118
Yeah.

558
01:35:08,798 --> 01:35:11,188
You and you, with me. You, go.

559
01:36:26,638 --> 01:36:29,312
Welcome to "Reflections of the Soul"

560
01:36:29,398 --> 01:36:31,674
at the New Modern NYC.

561
01:36:33,158 --> 01:36:34,831
Within this exhibition,

562
01:36:34,918 --> 01:36:38,150
the interplay of light
and the nature of self-images

563
01:36:38,238 --> 01:36:40,195
coalesce to provide an experience

564
01:36:40,278 --> 01:36:42,429
which will highlight the fragility

565
01:36:42,518 --> 01:36:46,478
of our perception of space
and our place within it.

566
01:36:46,558 --> 01:36:49,790
We hope through this exhibit
we can provide new insights

567
01:36:49,878 --> 01:36:51,915
into your understanding of the world,

568
01:36:51,998 --> 01:36:55,514
and just possibly lead you
to deeper reflection

569
01:36:55,598 --> 01:36:57,191
into the nature of self.

570
01:37:12,158 --> 01:37:15,117
The marker is complete, John.

571
01:37:15,198 --> 01:37:16,791
You should have just run away.

572
01:37:27,398 --> 01:37:29,594
You know what the
Camorra will do to you.

573
01:37:31,318 --> 01:37:33,150
You think you're Old Testament?

574
01:37:34,158 --> 01:37:35,558
No, John.

575
01:37:37,918 --> 01:37:38,918
No.

576
01:37:41,478 --> 01:37:43,356
Killing me won't stop the contract.

577
01:37:45,078 --> 01:37:48,913
Killing me will make it so much worse.

578
01:37:51,918 --> 01:37:53,068
John...

579
01:37:54,478 --> 01:37:55,673
you know what I think?

580
01:37:58,318 --> 01:38:00,674
I think you are addicted to it.

581
01:38:00,758 --> 01:38:01,758
To the vengeance.

582
01:38:19,838 --> 01:38:22,478
Welcome to "Reflections of the Soul"

583
01:38:22,558 --> 01:38:25,437
at the New Modern NYC.

584
01:38:28,198 --> 01:38:29,427
No wife.

585
01:38:31,118 --> 01:38:32,438
No life.

586
01:38:34,718 --> 01:38:35,718
No home.

587
01:38:37,078 --> 01:38:40,628
Vengeance... it's all you have.

588
01:38:42,158 --> 01:38:44,468
You wanted me back.

589
01:38:45,518 --> 01:38:46,554
I'm back.

590
01:41:42,758 --> 01:41:46,115
You are now exiting
"Reflections of the Soul"

591
01:41:46,198 --> 01:41:47,678
at the New Modern NYC.

592
01:41:48,678 --> 01:41:50,874
We hope that your journey
through the exhibit

593
01:41:50,998 --> 01:41:53,718
has been one of
reflective contemplation

594
01:41:53,798 --> 01:41:56,313
allowing for a new perspective
and insight.

595
01:42:01,238 --> 01:42:04,390
You are now exiting
"Reflections of the Soul..."

596
01:43:23,998 --> 01:43:27,355
You are now exiting
"Reflections of the Soul..."

597
01:43:40,398 --> 01:43:41,878
Good evening.

598
01:43:43,678 --> 01:43:45,351
Is the manager in?

599
01:43:45,438 --> 01:43:48,795
The manager is always in.

600
01:43:53,918 --> 01:43:54,918
Winston.

601
01:43:56,598 --> 01:43:57,748
Mr. D'Antonio.

602
01:43:58,958 --> 01:44:00,756
Your evening has been colorful, I see.

603
01:44:01,758 --> 01:44:03,909
Seeking safe harbor, I presume?

604
01:44:05,158 --> 01:44:07,514
I want his membership revoked.
Now.

605
01:44:07,598 --> 01:44:11,956
In the eyes of this institution,
Mr. Wick has breached no legalities.

606
01:44:12,038 --> 01:44:14,155
Then you know that I have the right
to demand...

607
01:44:14,238 --> 01:44:18,471
Nothing.
You demand nothing of me, Mr. D'Antonio.

608
01:44:18,558 --> 01:44:21,278
This kingdom is mine and mine alone.

609
01:44:24,318 --> 01:44:25,991
All right.

610
01:44:26,078 --> 01:44:28,912
Then enjoy your kingdom, Winston,
while you still can.

611
01:44:28,998 --> 01:44:32,674
And you, its privileges, sir.

612
01:44:45,598 --> 01:44:48,158
I'm here to see Santino D'Antonio.

613
01:44:52,118 --> 01:44:54,474
He's waiting for you
in the lounge, sir.

614
01:45:45,998 --> 01:45:47,068
Duck fat.

615
01:45:47,158 --> 01:45:48,717
Makes all the difference.

616
01:45:49,718 --> 01:45:51,198
Jonathan...

617
01:45:51,278 --> 01:45:52,398
Have you seen the menu here?

618
01:45:53,998 --> 01:45:56,354
- Lot of options.
- Jonathan, listen to me...

619
01:45:56,438 --> 01:45:59,875
A man can stay here a long time

620
01:45:59,998 --> 01:46:01,637
and never eat the same meal twice.

621
01:46:02,638 --> 01:46:05,995
Jonathan, just walk away.

622
01:46:08,198 --> 01:46:09,268
Yeah, Jonathan.

623
01:46:09,358 --> 01:46:10,872
Walk a...

624
01:46:18,918 --> 01:46:20,796
What have you done?

625
01:46:24,838 --> 01:46:25,838
Finished it.

626
01:46:44,318 --> 01:46:46,116
How was he?

627
01:46:46,198 --> 01:46:49,077
He was a good dog.
I have enjoyed his company.

628
01:46:54,318 --> 01:46:55,354
Let's go home.

629
01:48:32,518 --> 01:48:33,838
Mr. Wick?

630
01:48:40,318 --> 01:48:42,469
If you would be so inclined.

631
01:49:16,798 --> 01:49:17,798
Come on, boy.

632
01:49:26,598 --> 01:49:28,988
It has been a pleasure, Mr. Wick.

633
01:49:35,998 --> 01:49:37,318
Goodbye.

634
01:50:14,398 --> 01:50:15,912
Jonathan.

635
01:50:15,998 --> 01:50:17,148
Winston.

636
01:50:18,838 --> 01:50:20,113
What am I lookin' at?

637
01:50:22,398 --> 01:50:24,913
The Camorra's doubled
Santino's open contract.

638
01:50:24,998 --> 01:50:26,193
It's gone international.

639
01:50:27,438 --> 01:50:28,713
High Table?

640
01:50:28,798 --> 01:50:29,798
Mmm-hmm.

641
01:50:31,398 --> 01:50:32,468
And the Continental?

642
01:50:34,438 --> 01:50:36,475
You killed a man on company grounds,
Jonathan.

643
01:50:36,558 --> 01:50:40,347
You leave me no choice
but to declare you excommunicado.

644
01:50:42,358 --> 01:50:46,238
The doors to any service or provider
in connection with the Continental

645
01:50:46,318 --> 01:50:48,753
are now closed to you.

646
01:50:52,158 --> 01:50:54,150
I am so sorry.

647
01:50:56,198 --> 01:50:58,190
Your life is now forfeit.

648
01:51:00,798 --> 01:51:02,755
Then why am I not dead?

649
01:51:04,078 --> 01:51:06,434
Because I deemed it not to be.

650
01:51:09,438 --> 01:51:10,438
Now.

651
01:51:38,238 --> 01:51:41,436
You have one hour.
I can't delay it any longer.

652
01:51:43,278 --> 01:51:44,712
You might need this...

653
01:51:46,718 --> 01:51:47,718
down the road.

654
01:51:52,358 --> 01:51:53,358
Winston...

655
01:51:54,958 --> 01:51:56,278
tell them.

656
01:51:57,438 --> 01:51:59,430
Tell them all.

657
01:51:59,518 --> 01:52:01,510
Whoever comes,

658
01:52:01,598 --> 01:52:02,918
whoever it is...

659
01:52:04,038 --> 01:52:05,438
I'll kill them.

660
01:52:06,438 --> 01:52:08,077
I'll kill them all.

661
01:52:11,918 --> 01:52:13,318
'Course you will.

662
01:52:17,798 --> 01:52:19,118
Jonathan.

663
01:52:21,118 --> 01:52:22,438
Winston.

664
01:52:45,318 --> 01:52:46,638
Accounts payable.

665
01:52:49,318 --> 01:52:53,312
One-one-one-one-one.

666
01:52:55,318 --> 01:52:57,150
In one hour.

667
01:52:58,158 --> 01:52:59,308
John Wick.

668
01:53:00,998 --> 01:53:02,876
Excommunicado.

669
01:53:26,598 --> 01:53:29,909
Order 11111 confirmed.

670
01:53:31,939 --> 01:53:43,939
