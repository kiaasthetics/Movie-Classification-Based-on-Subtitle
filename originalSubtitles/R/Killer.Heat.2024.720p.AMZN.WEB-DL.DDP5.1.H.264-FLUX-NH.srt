about the guy who flew too high.</i>

2
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:08,416
<i>Icarus was his name,
and he had a pair of homemade wings.</i>

3
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:14,291
<i>And he thought he could
just keep going up forever,</i>

4

<i>higher than anyone, higher than the gods.</i>

5
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:27,125
<i>And he knew what would happen
if he got too close to the sun.</i>

6
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,166
<i>But he did it anyway.</i>

7
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:29,333
<i>The Icarus myth was set
on the island of Crete.</i>

8
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:36,333
<i>And apparently, nobody there
had learned much from his story.</i>

9
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,125

13

<i>The family of the fallen guy were rich--
really rich.</i>

14
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,500
<i>They were in shipping.</i>

15
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,125
<i>They ran the island
through violence and extortion.</i>

16
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,833

18

Thanks so much.

Sorry, could I ask you a favor?
You mind taking off your sunglasses?

34
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,750
- Excuse me?
- I don't mean to be rude.

35
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,666
I just like to look people in the eye
when I talk to them.

36
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,583
I have a problem of my own,
and I can't trust the local police.

37
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,958
- Why is that?
- My husband's family owns them.

38
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,125
Vardakises are like gods here.

39
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,125
And in Crete,
no one goes against the gods.

40

Murder.

46
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,166
No one will investigate.

47
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,958
It's not a narrative that works
for my husband's family.

48
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,708
They run Eurytus, the shipping company.

49
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:39,958
Right, I know it.

50
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:43,416
Yeah. Anything other than an accident
could cause turbulence to the stock,

51
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,958

52
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,416

My question to you is: why?

55
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,375
Your husband's a powerful man.

56
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:57,125

00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,458
♪ ♪

176
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,666
Shit.

177
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,791
<i>Elias Vardakis.</i>

178
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:47,083
<i>His brother had just died
climbing free solo,</i>

179
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:50,166
<i>but there he was without a rope.</i>

180
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,583
<i>You might call that confidence.</i>

181
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,541
<i>I'd say he had something to prove.</i>

182
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,000
<i>Just like Icarus.</i>

183
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,916
<i>Some guys need to feel like
they're above everyone.</i>

184
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,291
Lot of climbers out today.

185
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:14,041
- There's usually more. It's too hot.
- Hmm.

186
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,416
- You climb?
- Nah, it's not my thing.

187
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,916
Uh, my name's Nick Bali.
I'm here to talk to you about Leo.

188
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,583
I'm with
the National Intelligence Service.

189
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,583
An American in the Greek NIS?

190
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,708
I know.
I'm actually a Greek-American expat.

191
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:28,416
My accent's not the best, but I get by.

192
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,416
There's a couple of us
in the organization.

193
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,166
They bring us into situations like this

194
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:35,500
where your company's taken heavy
investment from my side of the pond.

195
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,458
Well, of course.

196
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,875
Can I see some I.D.?

197
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,666
Absolutely.

198
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,750
And you know, it's good you ask.

199
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,708
Not everybody does.

200
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:49,541
I'm trying to be discreet,
out of respect, but, uh, if you want,

201
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:53,208
I could go now and then bring back
a couple more agents.

202
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,958
We could, uh, search your house,
your car--

203
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,458
My mother's not to be disturbed.

204
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,916
All right, so let me buy you a coffee.

205
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,583
<i>Are you sure you, uh...
you don't want anything? Coffee?</i>

206
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,958
<i>What can you tell me about
what happened to your brother?</i>

207
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:17,333
I was told the police had closed
their investigation.

208
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah, they have. It's just,
your family's profile being what it is,

209
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,833
it's important that we come in
and dot the I's, cross the T's.

210
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:28,166
Remove any suspicion
there's been criminal activity.

211
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,291
Is that what you think happened?

212
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:35,500
If you don't mind, could we start with,
uh, the morning of your brother's death?

213
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,833
Where were you?

214
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,000
At home in bed.

215
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,500
My wife come in, woke me,
told me Leo's body had been found.

216
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,458
Mm-hmm. And, uh, what time was that?

217
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:46,458
8:30-ish. She's usually up for a swim
by 7:00, has her breakfast by the pool.

218
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,291
When's the last time
you saw your brother alive?

219
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,958
It was three weeks before he died.

220
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:59,208
Three weeks?
Since you'd seen your brother?

221
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,291
Is that so strange?

222
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,291
When'd you last see your brother?

223
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,416
I don't have one.

224
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,125
Well, your family then,
your mother, father, wife.

225
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:13,750
It's an island.

226
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,000
I just figured you'd run into each other.

227
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,708
You'll hear this anyway,
so I'll tell you myself.

228
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,958
The last time Leo and I were together,
we had a fight.

229
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,916
Okay. Uh, what was it about?

230
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,541
Don't remember.

231
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,541
We were drunk.

232
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,833
My father pit us against each other
from an early age,

233
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,958
gave us boxing gloves when we were four.

234
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,916
It stuck as a habit.

235
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:42,041
So you two, uh, you didn't get along?

236
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:47,166
We were monozygotic twins, Mr. Bali.

237
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,708
You don't get closer than that.

238
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,583
I loved my brother.

239
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,041
I just wish I'd been there for him.

240
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:04,208
Well, this must be a very hard time
for you, your family, your wife.

241
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:07,083
Uh, was she very close with your brother?

242
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,208
Not really.

243
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,000
My apologies.

244
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,500
I have a business matter
I need to attend to.

245
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,166
The life of a CEO
of a multinational like Eurytus.

246
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,916
Listen, I'll get the coffee.

247
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,916
You've been very generous with your time.

248
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,458
If you think of anything else

249
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,791
or if, um, perhaps your mother
would be willing to speak--

250
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,375
Look, I am happy to help you.

251
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,875
Leave my mother out of this.

252
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,250
She's lost her husband and a son
in the space of 18 months.

253
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,083
I don't want anything else upsetting her.

254
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,625
You get all that?

255
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,708
Why don't we listen back to it together?

256
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,916
We can compare notes.

257
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,750
Yeah, well, first you're gonna
have to let me know who you really are,

258
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:14,083
because one minute you're from
an insurance company and now you're NIS.

259
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:17,250
I was a detective for the NYPD.

260
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,916
Now I'm doing P.I. work out of Athens.

261
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,083
Why Athens?

262
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,333
Because my uncle owns an apartment here.

263
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:26,000
It's a piece-of-shit place,
but rent's cheap.

264
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,166
It's somewhere to escape to.

265
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,666
What are you escaping from?

266
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:33,750
Family things.

267
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,500
Look.

268
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:40,000
I can imagine how the Vardakis family
treats people on this island,

269
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,125
so I can also imagine
why a good cop like you

270
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:45,375
would want to knock them down a peg
if you saw a way.

271
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,500
So why don't you and me...

272
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,583
...help each other out a little bit?

273
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,583
Come on.

274
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,916
<i>When's the last time
that you saw your brother alive?</i>

275
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,125
- <i>Three weeks before he died.
- Oh.</i>

276
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,708
<i>It'd been three weeks
since you'd seen your brother?</i>

277
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,833
<i>Is that strange?</i>

278
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:16,375
<i>When was the last time
you saw your brother?</i>

279
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,625
<i>I don't have one.</i>

280
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,708
<i>Well, your family then,
your mother, father,</i>

281
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,250
<i>wife.</i>

282
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,333
Smart. Turning it around on me.
He's good under pressure.

283
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,041
- You think he's hiding something?
- Yeah.

284
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,125
<i>He was fussing with
his wedding ring right there,</i>

285
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,000
<i>and he scratched his chin.</i>

286
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,375
If scratching was a sign of guilt,
my dog would be doing 20 years to life.

287
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,750
<i>...your family,
your wife.</i>

288
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,625
<i>Was she very close with your brother?</i>

289
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,291
<i>Not really.</i>

290
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,625
He hesitated there.

291
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,083
And he's too emphatic,
the way he shuts it down.

292
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:48,208
He's jealous of something, of someone.
I can feel it.

293
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:51,000
But he's got everything
a man could possibly want.

294
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,625
Money, power, a beautiful wife.

295
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,625
If anyone would've been jealous,
it was Leo.

296
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:58,333
Yeah, that's the part I'm stuck on.
Something doesn't fit.

297
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:01,583
- Could you send me a copy
of that audio file?
- Yeah, all right.

298
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,625
Who's this?

299
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,625
That's Yannis Dimitriou.

300
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,500
Local fixer.

301
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,708
When high rollers come into town,
he hooks them up with whatever they need.

302
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,125
Drugs, parties, women.

303
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,875
Him and Elias are good friends.

304
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,333
Sorry, uh... I got to go.

305
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:23,833
So you still think he's just some rich guy
who slipped off a rock?

306
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,250
- You still think the case is closed?
- Officially, sure.

307
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,625
Unofficially, I never did.

308
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:31,708
But, you know,
let's keep all this between us.

309
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:34,333
These walls have big ears.

310
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,541
Thank you.

311
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,291
I loved it.

312
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,916
You're welcome, my child.

313
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:07,875
Did you speak with Elias?

314
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:09,458
Yeah.

315
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,583
You have to ask me before you talk
to anyone in this family.

316
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:17,875
Was Elias jealous of his brother?

317
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,250
Why would he be jealous?

318
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,708
I don't know.
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

319
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:23,875
But you knew Leo
before you knew him, right?

320
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,083
Sure.

321
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,083
You want to tell me about that?

322
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:28,916
What do you want to know?

323
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:30,666
Tell me the whole story.

324
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,541
Um, all right, I met Leo Freshers' week

325
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:36,125
<i>at Oxford.</i>

326
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:41,916
<i>I didn't come from money, so I had to
work my ass off to get a scholarship.</i>

327
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:44,416
Anything else?

328
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:46,291
Not unless you want to help me
write a paper--

329
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:49,000
<i>But even with a scholarship,
I still had to get another job</i>

330
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,416
<i>just to offset bills.</i>

331
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:51,750
Can I buy you a drink later?

332
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,583
<i>I didn't have any free time
for friends or social life.</i>

333
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:55,750
I like a little pressure--

334
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,708
<i>But that didn't stop Leo
from hanging around.</i>

335
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:00,083
<i>It was strange.</i>

336
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:01,458
<i>Yeah, I didn't really know
what to make of it at first.</i>

337
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:04,125
<i>You know, this rich kid
who went to the best boarding schools</i>

338
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:06,125
<i>his entire life, and...</i>

339
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:09,125
<i>and him showing attention to me.</i>

340
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:11,500
It was flattering, don't get me wrong,

341
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,708
but, um, there was just always
something that was very...

342
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:20,208
He was trying really hard, and
it came across as desperate and needy--

343
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,375
Uh, when we first spoke,
you said he was sweet and kind.

00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:17,500
<i>She was so protective of him.</i>

520
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:24,500
<i>I just had no idea how much
Leo was excluded from the family.</i>

521
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:29,500
<i>Or how deep the rivalry was
with his brother.</i>

522
00:37:34,166 --> 00:37:37,250
That must have been, uh,
very painful for Leo.

523
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,541
Being in love with you.

524
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:43,166
Watching you fall for him.

525
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:47,250
Yeah.

526
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:58,375
Elias and Leo got in a fight the last time
they saw each other before Leo died.

527
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:02,875
Did Leo know something
about your husband that got him killed?

528
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:04,833
Killed by who?

529
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:08,250
By someone with a vested interest
in keeping Elias in power.

530
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:11,583
I want to talk to Audrey.

531
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:13,625
That's not gonna happen.

532
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:18,000
If Leo was threatening Elias, threatening
the company, threatening the family,

533
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,500
Audrey would know.

534
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,750
Yeah, but even if she did,
she wouldn't say anything to you.

535
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:25,666
That's why I want to see her face
when I bring it up.

536
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:27,666
Well, you're not gonna get
anywhere near her.

537
00:38:27,666 --> 00:38:29,958
She has security,
and ever since Elias's dad died,

538
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:31,833
he's been very protective of her.

539
00:38:31,833 --> 00:38:33,791
Yeah.

540
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:37,458
Okay, what about, uh...
the... thing tonight?

541
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:40,166
- The benefit?
- It's an exclusive event,
and it's on the yacht.

542
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:42,000
It's an exclusive--
What are you, uh, protecting her?

543
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,791
- No. God, no.
- Then get me on the list.

544
00:38:43,791 --> 00:38:45,583
I can't. You don't understand.

545
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:47,916
I am trying to help you.
Do you want answers or not?

546
00:38:47,916 --> 00:38:50,458
I know, but if Elias ever found out
that I was the one who arranged this--

547
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:53,375
He's not gonna know that.
No one'll know that.

548
00:38:57,625 --> 00:38:59,750
Fine. Uh, okay. Uh, all right.

549
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:02,666
- Okay.
- Okay.

550
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,625
You can't go looking like that, though.

551
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:07,458
I'll have something sent over.

552
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:10,041
Wait, wait. Looking like what?

553
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:15,625
<i>The suit she had sent over
cost more than a decent car.</i>

554
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:19,666
<i>- And guess what color the pants were.</i>
- Welcome, sir. Enjoy the party.

555
00:39:41,666 --> 00:39:42,833
I'll keep this brief.

556
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:45,416
I just want to thank you all
for joining us this evening

557
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:48,791
to support the reelection
of our governor, Kostas Gerontas.

558
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:50,000
Kostas...

559
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:57,833
This island has always been
a haven for our family,

560
00:39:57,833 --> 00:40:00,125
and never more so than this past week,

561
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:03,083
which has been
the hardest that we've known.

562
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:05,416
Governor Gerontas
and the entire police department

563
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:08,833
have made my family feel
protected and safe,

564
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:12,291
which, when you lose someone,
is what matters most.

565
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:14,625
Thank you, my friend.

566
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:18,500
With your help, we can give this good man
another term in office to protect us all.

567
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,916
Thank you all very much
for being here.

568
00:40:22,916 --> 00:40:26,333
Thank you for all of your support.

569
00:40:33,416 --> 00:40:35,250
- Well done.
- Thank you, Mother.

570
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:38,166
Nice to see you.

571
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:40,250
- Nicki, you're looking lovely.
- Oh, thank you.

572
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:55,750
Whiskey.

573
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,083
Elias's words were perfect.

574
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:04,875
I'm sorry. I should introduce myself.

575
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:06,583
I'm Nick. I'm a friend of Leo's.

576
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:09,666
My family always used to vacation here.
They still do, actually.

577
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:12,291
So there were a whole bunch of us
that used to hang out.

578
00:41:12,291 --> 00:41:15,333
- Victoria, you know.
- Yes, of course.

579
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:19,000
- I'm so sorry for your loss,
Mrs. Vardakis.
- Mm.

580
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,291
Thank you.

581
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:25,958
Leo was a kind soul.

582
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:27,125
So creative.

583
00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:30,291
- He was a dreamer.
- Yeah.

584
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:32,166
Yeah, he was.

585
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:35,583
And Elias is holding up okay
considering what happened.

586
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:37,250
The strange way that Leo died.

587
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,833
I can't believe this thing they're saying
about it being an accident, do you?

588
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:45,125
I mean, Leo was a good climber.
He wouldn't just fall.

589
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,625
I'm used to people
coming after me and my family.

590
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:53,166
So let's cut the shit, Nick.

591
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:55,250
Why did you buy a new suit
and come here tonight?

592
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,750
What do you want?

593
00:41:57,833 --> 00:41:59,791
Trying to understand
what really happened to my friend.

594
00:41:59,791 --> 00:42:00,875
Get away from her!

595
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:03,083
- I told you to leave her alone.
- You know this man?

596
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:04,791
He said he was NIS
looking into Leo's death.

597
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:07,166
He's a fucking liar. He's a P.I.

598
00:42:07,166 --> 00:42:10,000
Who hired you? Victoria?

599
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,416
I'm afraid that's between me
and my client.

600
00:42:11,416 --> 00:42:13,750
My brother's death
was an accident.

601
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,750
- I don't think so.
- Is that what you're trying to prove

602
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,583
bribing your way into the morgue?

603
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:20,083
Hanging around the police station?
It's pathetic.

604
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:22,583
This man gets no more cooperation
from now on. Do you understand?

605
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:24,916
Now get the fuck off my boat
before I throw you off.

606
00:42:24,916 --> 00:42:27,500
Oh. Was that a confession?

607
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,166
Now go back to Athens.

608
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:32,041
Better yet, go back to New York.

609
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:34,291
To the wife and kids you walked out on.

610
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:48,875
Governor, my apologies.

611
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:50,625
Some people have too much to drink.

612
00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:52,833
Get a bit silly on boats, don't they?

613
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,500
I got a call from my boss.

614
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,458
If I'm seen within three feet of you,
then I'm suspended.

615
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:31,041
I can't risk it.

616
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:34,583
You should just go.

617
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:42,500
Yeah.

618
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,958
Maybe you should call this...
all this a day.

619
00:43:50,416 --> 00:43:54,250
Whatever's going on here,
it is not worth it.

620
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:57,250
The police aren't gonna reopen the case.

621
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,916
Just go.

622
00:43:58,916 --> 00:44:01,583
Live your life.

623
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:05,916
What life? I don't have a fucking life.

624
00:44:05,916 --> 00:44:08,958
Guys like that, they get the life.

625
00:44:08,958 --> 00:44:10,083
They get everything.

626
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:11,916
They want something,
they just fucking take it.

627
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:14,041
They got money.

628
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:17,166
Dressed like a male fucking model.

629
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:19,000
Whole world wants to suck his dick.

630
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,875
You know what? That guy is scared.

631
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:25,083
He's fucking scared,
and he fucking should be.

632
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,416
Be careful, my friend.

633
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:35,083
A man like that, he doesn't ask twice.

634
00:44:35,083 --> 00:44:36,583
You should go.

635
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,208
<i>He was right.</i>

636
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:46,791
<i>Of course he was.</i>

637
00:44:46,791 --> 00:44:48,000
<i>But...</i>

638
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,708
<i>...I've never been great
at letting things go.</i>

639
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:12,541
<i>When I caught her,
she didn't hold back on her reasons.</i>

640
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:17,125
<i>She told me that I worked too much,
that I drank too much,</i>

641
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:19,833
<i>that she wasn't happy.</i>

642
00:45:19,833 --> 00:45:23,000
<i>But... did I let it go?</i>

643
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:28,500
We're gonna be okay.

644
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:35,666
We're gonna be okay.

645
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,375
<i>Any reasonable person would've been
off that island before breakfast.</i>

646
00:46:08,708 --> 00:46:12,583
<i>But the monks made really good coffee.</i>

647
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:17,541
<i>And I am not a reasonable person.</i>

648
00:46:36,583 --> 00:46:37,583
<i>I-I don't know.</i>

649
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:41,291
I mean, Elias runs the company,
but Audrey runs the family.

The American, Yannis is looking for him.

He likes it.

663
00:50:55,666 --> 00:50:57,500
I told you to leave the island.

664
00:50:59,625 --> 00:51:01,166
I won't tell you again.

00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:50,458
Thank you for not blowing my cover
on the yacht.

674
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:52,958
- What happened?
- Ah.

675
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:58,833
I like to look people in the eye
when I speak to them.

676
00:53:04,375 --> 00:53:06,125
Who did this?

677
00:53:08,375 --> 00:53:12,708
I followed Elias into Kíthira last night
and saw him give Yannis some cash.

678
00:53:12,708 --> 00:53:14,000
They spotted me.
I should've been more careful.

679
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,666
Elias did this?

680
00:53:15,666 --> 00:53:17,208
Yannis, technically.

681
00:53:17,208 --> 00:53:19,708
Nick, they could've killed you.

682
00:53:19,708 --> 00:53:21,958
Yeah, and if he finds out
that you hired me,

683
00:53:21,958 --> 00:53:23,875
what do you think he's gonna do to you?

684
00:53:23,875 --> 00:53:26,166
- I'm not afraid.
- Maybe you should be.

685
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:29,083
Come on.

686
00:53:34,541 --> 00:53:38,333
These ruins date back
to the seventh century B.C.

687
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:40,916
This city was named after
this goddess Leto.

688
00:53:40,916 --> 00:53:43,958
Story goes that
Zeus fell in love with her.

689
00:53:43,958 --> 00:53:45,666

behind these ruins.</i>

691
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:52,416
<i>About the gods of this island
and their jealousies.</i>

692
00:53:52,416 --> 00:53:54,666
The lesson is
do not betray the gods.

693
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:56,708

694
00:53:56,708 --> 00:53:58,625

695
00:53:59,791 --> 00:54:02,625
People like Yannis,
they do anything he tells them to.

696
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:05,708
He's the first person Elias calls
when we land here.

697
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:07,875
- Gets him anything he wants.
- I heard about that.

698
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:10,500
Drugs, parties.

699
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,916

700

701

702

It's been going on for years.

703
00:54:21,041 --> 00:54:23,125
Started right after we got married.

704
00:54:23,125 --> 00:54:26,833
I called him out about it early on,
but somehow it was always my fault.

705
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:29,791

706
00:54:29,791 --> 00:54:32,125
Why didn't you just walk away?

707
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:33,291
People do.

708
00:54:33,291 --> 00:54:35,666
If it was that easy,
don't you think I would?

709
00:54:35,666 --> 00:54:37,666
I've tried.

710
00:54:37,666 --> 00:54:39,250
He doesn't listen to me.

711
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:42,000
I tell him I need to leave.
He tells me I can't.

712
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:47,125
He goes on and on
about being in love with me.

713
00:54:47,125 --> 00:54:51,583
How if I ever did leave,
he'd kill himself or kill me.

714
00:54:51,583 --> 00:54:53,333
And he promises he'll change.

715
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:54,666
You know, that he'll do anything.

716
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:57,833
The fucked-up thing is that
he actually does change.

717
00:54:57,833 --> 00:55:00,000
Just long enough to make me believe.

718
00:55:03,541 --> 00:55:06,125
I know that that sounds weak.

719
00:55:06,125 --> 00:55:08,083
It is weak.

720
00:55:08,083 --> 00:55:10,250
I've just never been strong enough.

721
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:12,375
That why you had an affair with Leo?

722
00:55:14,541 --> 00:55:17,666
You left a hair tie in his apartment.

723
00:55:17,666 --> 00:55:20,750
It was the same one you were using
when you were swimming at the villa.

724
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:23,666
You lied to me.

725
00:55:23,666 --> 00:55:25,583
I went to that party
thinking it was blackmail,

726
00:55:25,583 --> 00:55:28,708
thinking the whole gigantic
family business was at stake

727
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:29,916
and that Audrey was involved.

728
00:55:29,916 --> 00:55:33,791
I asked you, "Is there any reason
Elias would be jealous of Leo?"

729
00:55:33,791 --> 00:55:34,958
- You said no.
- I never said no.

730
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:36,500
Fine, but the whole time,
you were covering up an affair.

731
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,000
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I couldn't risk that.

732
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:42,041
I didn't trust you yet.

733
00:55:43,041 --> 00:55:45,166
You saying you trust me now?

734
00:55:45,166 --> 00:55:46,416
Maybe.

735
00:55:46,416 --> 00:55:48,125
Can you trust me?

736
00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:50,041
I don't know. You cheated on your husband.

737
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:57,208
Elias doesn't know about Leo.

738
00:55:57,208 --> 00:55:59,416
I think he does.

739
00:55:59,416 --> 00:56:01,291
I could tell that guy
was jealous of something.

740
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:03,791
Now I know what.
The guy's brother slept with his wife.

741
00:56:03,791 --> 00:56:06,625
He killed him for it.
Talk about an old story.

742
00:56:06,625 --> 00:56:08,125
Now I just need to prove it.

743
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:13,666
Beach where Leo died,
could a person swim those waters?

744
00:56:13,666 --> 00:56:17,333
Uh, it's about two miles
of rocky coast in either direction

745
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:19,166
and the currents are very strong.

746
00:56:19,166 --> 00:56:21,500
So maybe a boat?

747
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,666
'Cause you said
the cliff's inaccessible by land,

748
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:25,583
so whoever killed Leo
had to get to the beach

749
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:27,291
and then leave the beach again by sea.

750
00:56:27,291 --> 00:56:30,750
And if they can't swim it,
maybe there's a boat waiting.

751
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:34,250
The first time we were there,
I noticed some fishermen offshore.

752
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:35,750
Maybe someone saw something.

753
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:38,083
And if they did, you really
think they're gonna say anything to you?

754
00:56:39,416 --> 00:56:41,000
Don't betray the gods, right?

755

756
00:56:42,541 --> 00:56:45,125

757
00:56:45,125 --> 00:56:47,708
