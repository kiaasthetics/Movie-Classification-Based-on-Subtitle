1
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,612
I'm sorry.

2
00:04:08,614 --> 00:04:10,694
- Oh, it's okay.
- I'm sorry, baby.

3
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:14,316
- I'm sorry.
- Fucking shoulder.

4
00:04:15,418 --> 00:04:16,951
Keep going.

5
00:04:17,953 --> 00:04:19,420
That's helping.

6
00:04:25,393 --> 00:04:26,659
Never.

7
00:04:26,661 --> 00:04:28,594
Just a little bit.
Just to clean it up.

8
00:04:28,596 --> 00:04:29,795
I'm not cutting it.

9
00:04:29,797 --> 00:04:31,897
But you'd look so hot
with short hair.

10
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:34,032
- Oh, would I?
- Yeah.

11
00:04:34,034 --> 00:04:35,466
- Thank you.
- No, no, no...

12
00:04:35,468 --> 00:04:37,601
Sorry, I didn't mean it
like that.

13
00:04:37,603 --> 00:04:39,536
You are hot.

14
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:42,605
You are the hottest.

15
00:04:42,607 --> 00:04:45,507
- Keep going.
- You and your gorgeous,

16
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:47,942
thick, long hair.

17
00:04:47,944 --> 00:04:50,311
- Continue...
- I just fucking love the way it's long.

18
00:04:50,313 --> 00:04:51,412
Yeah?

19
00:04:51,414 --> 00:04:54,715
Happy Father's Day, Daddy!

20
00:04:54,717 --> 00:04:56,883
Kids, we said after breakfast.

21
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:58,818
I want cake for breakfast.

22
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,621
Wow! Chocolate with sprinkles!

23
00:05:02,623 --> 00:05:03,722
My favorite.

24
00:05:03,724 --> 00:05:05,657
Happy Father's Day!

25
00:05:05,659 --> 00:05:07,325
- Open it! Open it! Open it!
- Open it! Open it! Open it!

26
00:05:07,327 --> 00:05:09,460
I am, I am.

27
00:05:09,462 --> 00:05:11,662
I like building up
the anticipation.

28
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:16,765
Oh, you guys...

29
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:18,700
- You like it?
- I love it.

30
00:05:18,702 --> 00:05:20,868
Muah! I love it.

31
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,803
- Thank you.
- Mom helped us.

32
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:25,906
No, I didn't.
It was all their idea.

33
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,775
- Right, kids?
- Right.

34
00:05:28,777 --> 00:05:30,810
- Cake! Cake! Cake!
- Cake! Cake! Cake!

35
00:05:30,812 --> 00:05:32,812
- Okay, okay.
- Cake! Cake! Cake!

36
00:05:32,814 --> 00:05:34,880
Cake! Cake! Cake! Cake!

37
00:05:34,882 --> 00:05:37,983
Oh, look at that
beautiful looking cake!

38
00:05:37,985 --> 00:05:40,385
Ah...

39
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:44,021
Who did this to monster!

40
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:50,760
Oh, you can't hide from monster!

41
00:05:50,762 --> 00:05:53,028
Monster can smell you!

42
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,662
Run! Run!
Monster's coming!

43
00:06:01,102 --> 00:06:02,935
Argh!

44
00:06:06,005 --> 00:06:08,873
Monster made kids disappear.

45
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,474
And...

46
00:06:10,476 --> 00:06:13,810
Monster wanna finish
what we started.

47
00:06:13,812 --> 00:06:16,479
Too late, the kids are awake.

48
00:06:16,481 --> 00:06:18,080
Monster sad.

49
00:06:18,082 --> 00:06:20,782
I'm sure monster can
wait till Monday.

50
00:06:20,784 --> 00:06:23,084
Monster been waiting
three weeks.

51
00:06:23,086 --> 00:06:25,086
Yeah, but with the kids
and my exhibition

52
00:06:25,088 --> 00:06:27,455
I cannot keep everybody
happy all the time.

53
00:06:27,457 --> 00:06:29,490
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

54
00:06:29,492 --> 00:06:31,859
Monster doesn't want
to start a fight.

55
00:06:31,861 --> 00:06:33,827
Okay. Sorry, me neither.

56
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:38,831
I promise we'll finish this
as soon as I get back.

57
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:45,537
Oh, monster happy.

58
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,705
Monster happy.

59
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,573
Monster very happy.

60
00:06:54,446 --> 00:06:56,879
Yeah, Mommy.

61
00:06:56,881 --> 00:06:58,580
<i>- Gracias.
- De nada.</i>

62
00:06:58,582 --> 00:07:00,815
- Everybody packed?
- Yeah.

63
00:07:00,817 --> 00:07:02,883
Monkey, good boy.

64
00:07:02,885 --> 00:07:05,685
Dad, why can't we take
Monkey to the beach with us?

65
00:07:05,687 --> 00:07:07,486
Yeah, you know
he loves the beach.

66
00:07:07,488 --> 00:07:09,588
Monkey needs to stay here
and keep your dad company

67
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,390
so he doesn't stay
all alone during the weekend.

68
00:07:12,392 --> 00:07:14,592
- That's unfair.
- Knock-knock.

69
00:07:14,594 --> 00:07:15,793
Hey, Louis!

70
00:07:15,795 --> 00:07:17,635
Hey, guys,
hot off the presses.

71
00:07:19,097 --> 00:07:20,663
- What's going on, Louis?
- What's shakin'?

72
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:22,164
What's going on, little guys?

73
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,598
Mr. Webber, how are you, sir?

74
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,566
Morning, Louis.

75
00:07:25,568 --> 00:07:28,135
I'd offer you a hand, but all
I can lift is this coffee.

76
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:32,539
Oh, that's what happens when
you try to impress girls in the bat cage.

77
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,141
I wasn't flirting,
I was being a gentleman.

78
00:07:35,143 --> 00:07:38,410
Yeah, I'm sure she was
a poor helpless 25-year-old.

79
00:07:38,412 --> 00:07:39,577
Yeah, helpless.

80
00:07:41,047 --> 00:07:42,613
Do you know what this is?

81
00:07:42,615 --> 00:07:45,148
Is it a Father's Day
present for Daddy?

82
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,150
No. No, this is
Mommy's catalog.

83
00:07:47,152 --> 00:07:49,552
Assuming they got the color
right this time.

84
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:50,886
Oh, let's hope.

85
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:53,922
I think they did.

86
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:59,159
It's a little bit magenta,
but it's almost perfect.

87
00:07:59,161 --> 00:08:00,593
- What's magenta?
- This color.

88
00:08:00,595 --> 00:08:02,828
Honey, it's perfect.

89
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,930
Mom, can Louis come
to the beach with us?

90
00:08:04,932 --> 00:08:06,932
Yeah.

91
00:08:06,934 --> 00:08:09,768
No, Louis needs to stay here
and do some work.

92
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,769
Just like your daddy.

93
00:08:10,771 --> 00:08:12,971
That's correct.

94
00:08:12,973 --> 00:08:16,774
Father's Day party that me and
your dad are gonna have tonight.

95
00:08:16,776 --> 00:08:18,642
Louis! Shh!

96
00:08:18,644 --> 00:08:21,211
- Oh, come on.
- You're not having a party.

97
00:08:21,213 --> 00:08:22,712
I'm not having a party,

98
00:08:22,714 --> 00:08:24,113
I'm working very hard.

99
00:08:24,115 --> 00:08:25,981
Did you pack your gun?

100
00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:28,049
- Yes.
- Did you pack the bomb?

101
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:29,650
- Yes.
- Have you packed the cannon?

102
00:08:29,652 --> 00:08:31,818
- Yes.
- Have you packed the chainsaw?

103
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,487
You didn't pack the chainsaw?

104
00:08:34,489 --> 00:08:36,989
Go get the chainsaw, man!

105
00:08:39,726 --> 00:08:42,594
The cement still hasn't dried,
but it should be fine by tomorrow night.

106
00:08:42,596 --> 00:08:46,764
Still, it's extremely fragile
and I don't trust those movers

107
00:08:46,766 --> 00:08:47,965
after the mess
they made at the gallery.

108
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:49,900
Mmm-mmm. No, I'll take
care of it. Don't worry.

109
00:08:49,902 --> 00:08:52,502
Okay, <i>gracias,</i> I'll have it
all packed up for you.

110
00:08:52,504 --> 00:08:53,870
Okay.

111
00:08:53,872 --> 00:08:57,073
It's almost dry though.

112
00:08:57,075 --> 00:08:59,041
Yeah, so I'll just text you
when it's at the gallery.

113
00:08:59,043 --> 00:09:01,143
Don't worry about anything,

114
00:09:01,145 --> 00:09:03,778
I got it all under control.
You have a good weekend at the beach.

115
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,746
Enjoy yourself. I'm out.

116
00:09:05,748 --> 00:09:07,814
<i>Gracias,</i> Louis.

117
00:09:07,816 --> 00:09:09,949
- Mr. Webber, I'll see you tomorrow.
- Thank you.

118
00:09:09,951 --> 00:09:12,051
I mean, "tonight"
for the super-secret party.

119
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:13,986
- Louis...
- See you, kids.

120
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:16,154
- Bye, Louis.
- Super-secret party?

121
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,523
- Super-secret party.
- Okay.

122
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:19,957
Is this the last one?

123
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,525
- You like it?
- I love it.

124
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:22,592
Good.

125
00:09:22,594 --> 00:09:24,760
I think it should be bigger.

126
00:09:24,762 --> 00:09:27,696
- You think so?
- Yeah, then we can get the pool.

127
00:09:27,698 --> 00:09:29,964
Okay, I'll do it
bigger next time.

128
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:34,268
I told Vivian tomorrow
at 2:00.

129
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,837
I don't need her therapy
anymore, it's healing.

130
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:38,772
Tell that to your shoulder.

131
00:09:38,774 --> 00:09:41,207
Dad, are you sure
you can't come to the beach with us?

132
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:43,742
I would love
nothing more, sport.

133
00:09:43,744 --> 00:09:46,144
But if Daddy doesn't work
this weekend, we'll have to live in a box.

134
00:09:46,146 --> 00:09:47,845
Do you guys
want to live in a box?

135
00:09:47,847 --> 00:09:49,112
- No.
- No. Not really.

136
00:09:49,114 --> 00:09:51,180
Me neither.
Unless I designed it.

137
00:09:51,182 --> 00:09:52,814
Okay, say goodbye to Daddy.

138
00:09:52,816 --> 00:09:53,981
Bye, Daddy.

139
00:09:53,983 --> 00:09:55,983
Say goodbye to Monkey.

140
00:09:55,985 --> 00:09:57,985
Bye, Monkey.

141
00:09:57,987 --> 00:10:00,721
Daddy, don't forget to send
all your party pix on Instagram.

142
00:10:00,723 --> 00:10:02,089
Okay.

143
00:10:02,091 --> 00:10:03,657
Call me when you get there.

144
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:05,258
I will. I love you.

145
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,180
- I love you.
- I love you.

146
00:10:07,827 --> 00:10:08,960
Bye, guys.

147
00:10:08,962 --> 00:10:10,061
- Bye.
- Bye, Daddy.

148
00:10:10,063 --> 00:10:11,529
Get a haircut, Dad!

149
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,573
Well, Monkey...

150
00:10:24,575 --> 00:10:26,335
Looks like it's just me
and you, kid.

151
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:50,253
Hey, baby.

152
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:52,287
How's the house?

153
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:54,355
<i>Hi! It's perfect.</i>

154
00:11:54,357 --> 00:11:57,257
<i>Look. Kids, say hello
to your dad.</i>

155
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,025
<i>- Hi!</i>
- Hello.

156
00:11:59,027 --> 00:12:00,860
<i>All it needs is you.</i>

157
00:12:09,902 --> 00:12:12,103
<i>- I love you.</i>
- I love you, too.

158
00:12:12,105 --> 00:12:13,170
Miss you.

159
00:12:14,138 --> 00:12:15,338
Good night.

160
00:13:48,358 --> 00:13:49,825
Who's there?

161
00:13:53,162 --> 00:13:56,397
Just one second, sir, please.

162
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,119
- Hello?
- Could I use your phone, please?

163
00:14:01,234 --> 00:14:02,601
Yes?

164
00:14:02,603 --> 00:14:04,202
We're so sorry
to bother you, sir,

165
00:14:04,204 --> 00:14:07,205
but could you please tell us
where the Gregorys live?

166
00:14:07,207 --> 00:14:08,940
This is the third house
we've tried.

167
00:14:08,942 --> 00:14:11,302
Looks like everyone's gone
for the long weekend.

168
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,277
The Gregorys?

169
00:14:16,246 --> 00:14:18,347
No, I don't know anyone
around here

170
00:14:18,349 --> 00:14:19,414
by that name.

171
00:14:20,482 --> 00:14:22,850
What's the address?

172
00:14:22,852 --> 00:14:24,284
Um,

173
00:14:24,286 --> 00:14:26,352
I honestly don't know.

174
00:14:26,354 --> 00:14:28,587
My phone got wet
and she left hers at her house.

175
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:30,322
The taxi just dropped us here.

176
00:14:30,324 --> 00:14:32,357
We've been walking around
for, like, 20 minutes.

177
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:34,525
Yeah, my feet are, like, dying.

178
00:14:37,595 --> 00:14:40,396
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm afraid I can't help you.

179
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,201
Bless you.

180
00:14:52,406 --> 00:14:53,406
Here.

181
00:14:54,507 --> 00:14:55,874
Thank you.

182
00:15:01,013 --> 00:15:03,381
Well, if you guys want
you can come in and use my phone.

183
00:15:03,383 --> 00:15:06,350
Oh, thanks, but...

184
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:08,618
All our contacts are on
our phones.

185
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,553
I... I don't even know my own number,
can you believe it?

186
00:15:13,923 --> 00:15:15,490
Maybe Ashley's on Facebook chat?

187
00:15:15,492 --> 00:15:18,125
Ah, genius.

188
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:21,128
Actually, would you mind
if we just used your computer for a sec?

189
00:15:22,363 --> 00:15:24,330
We don't want to impose.

190
00:15:24,332 --> 00:15:26,898
We'll just get the address
and be out of your hair.

191
00:15:29,334 --> 00:15:31,535
Yeah. Sure.

192
00:15:31,537 --> 00:15:32,537
Come in.

193
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,670
Thank you.

194
00:15:45,147 --> 00:15:47,380
No, it's fine. Don't worry.

195
00:15:47,382 --> 00:15:48,547
Oh, I don't mind.

196
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:50,282
We don't want to mess up
your house.

197
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:52,450
Yeah. Excuse me.

198
00:15:58,356 --> 00:16:00,523
Um, thank you so, so much.

199
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:03,659
- I know this is so random.
- It's fine.

200
00:16:03,661 --> 00:16:07,129
Hang on, I'll get you
an iPad and some towels.

201
00:16:07,131 --> 00:16:08,363
Thanks.

202
00:16:10,966 --> 00:16:12,166
Nice house.

203
00:16:13,701 --> 00:16:15,168
Thanks.

204
00:16:35,656 --> 00:16:37,189
Girls?

205
00:16:37,191 --> 00:16:38,390
We're in here.

206
00:16:42,328 --> 00:16:44,262
I'm so sorry,
it was warmer here.

207
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:45,963
Hope you don't mind.

208
00:16:45,965 --> 00:16:47,431
We were freezing.

209
00:16:48,065 --> 00:16:49,131
Here.

210
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,233
Oh, my God. Thank you.

211
00:16:51,235 --> 00:16:54,135
This is beyond embarrassing.

212
00:16:54,137 --> 00:16:55,269
Don't worry about it.

213
00:16:55,271 --> 00:16:57,304
Make yourselves at home.

214
00:17:07,414 --> 00:17:09,214
I'm Bel, by the way.

215
00:17:10,316 --> 00:17:12,050
Evan.

216
00:17:12,052 --> 00:17:14,292
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

217
00:17:14,686 --> 00:17:16,219
Ashley's online.

218
00:17:16,687 --> 00:17:17,687
Cool.

219
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:23,525
You're a life saver, Evan.

220
00:17:23,527 --> 00:17:28,096
Not everyone would just let two total
strangers into their house these days.

221
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:30,465
Well, you don't look
that dangerous.

222
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:33,700
Worst case scenario,

223
00:17:33,702 --> 00:17:35,502
I know I can
take the both of you.

224
00:17:36,202 --> 00:17:37,735
I'm not so sure.

225
00:17:37,737 --> 00:17:39,336
I do air boxing.

226
00:17:39,338 --> 00:17:41,771
- Air boxing?
- Yeah, like, you know?

227
00:17:41,773 --> 00:17:44,540
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

228
00:17:45,508 --> 00:17:47,242
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes.

229
00:17:47,244 --> 00:17:49,364
- What's the address?
- His name's Evan.

230
00:17:49,645 --> 00:17:50,645
Evan?

231
00:17:51,412 --> 00:17:52,645
458 Canter.

232
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:58,383
Wow. We're like, far.

233
00:17:58,385 --> 00:18:00,752
It was Kantner, not Canter.

234
00:18:00,754 --> 00:18:04,021
The cab must've
misunderstood us.

235
00:18:04,023 --> 00:18:07,057
I told you that he was
going the wrong way.

236
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:10,026
That guy barely spoke English.

237
00:18:10,028 --> 00:18:12,495
I mean, his English
was worse than mine.

238
00:18:13,597 --> 00:18:15,297
This is so retarded.

239
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,799
Don't worry about it.
I'll call an Uber.

240
00:18:17,801 --> 00:18:20,034
No. No, no, no.

241
00:18:20,036 --> 00:18:22,436
We can find a cab outside.
It's no problem.

242
00:18:22,438 --> 00:18:25,572
Not around here, you won't.

243
00:18:25,574 --> 00:18:28,241
Trust me,
it's the only reliable way.

244
00:18:28,243 --> 00:18:30,743
You sure?
I feel like such an idiot.

245
00:18:30,745 --> 00:18:32,411
We don't want to ruin
your night.

246
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:33,612
No really. It's fine.

247
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,415
It's looking for a driver.

248
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,118
And it'll be here in...

249
00:18:43,454 --> 00:18:45,221
45 minutes.

250
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:47,756
That long?

251
00:18:48,557 --> 00:18:49,823
The rain.

252
00:18:49,825 --> 00:18:51,290
We're lucky we even got one.

253
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,300
What?

254
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:07,270
Um, I know this is gonna
sound weird,

255
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:11,474
but could we maybe throw our clothes in
your dryer just for, like, 10 minutes?

256
00:19:11,476 --> 00:19:13,275
We really don't want to go
to a party soaking wet.

257
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,342
No.

258
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,675
Please?

259
00:19:20,346 --> 00:19:23,548
Sure, sure. Um...

260
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,284
We have some extra robes.
I'll, uh, go get them.

261
00:19:26,286 --> 00:19:28,219
- Thank you.
- Yay.

262
00:19:28,221 --> 00:19:30,454
This is literally
saving our lives.

263
00:19:30,456 --> 00:19:32,422
Yeah, we could get sick and die.

264
00:19:36,493 --> 00:19:37,613
You have your phone?

265
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:39,593
Uh yeah, why?

266
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:42,509
I can try and fix it.

267
00:19:43,296 --> 00:19:44,596
Really? Oh.

268
00:19:45,598 --> 00:19:48,299
My kid dropped mine in the tub,

269
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:50,334
and you won't believe this,
but if you put it in rice

270
00:19:50,336 --> 00:19:51,568
it kinda dries it out.

271
00:19:52,603 --> 00:19:55,304
- That would be awesome.
- Rice?

272
00:19:55,306 --> 00:19:58,407
Oh, my God,
you're like a MythBuster.

273
00:19:58,409 --> 00:20:00,608
Thank you so much, Evan.

274
00:20:03,545 --> 00:20:05,646
You're welcome...

275
00:20:05,648 --> 00:20:07,581
- Genesis.
- Genesis.

276
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,849
Yeah, like
the beginning of time.

277
00:20:11,518 --> 00:20:12,598
In the beginning.

278
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:15,586
Sorry.

279
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:18,689
Yup, that was...
You're sick of that.

280
00:20:19,223 --> 00:20:20,289
Thanks.

281
00:20:21,224 --> 00:20:22,457
I'll, uh...

282
00:20:23,392 --> 00:20:24,625
I'll go get you some.

283
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,460
Hey, Evan?

284
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,229
Where should we put these?

285
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:06,496
Oh, I'll take them.

286
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:08,538
No, we can do it.
We don't mind.

287
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,433
I got it.

288
00:21:14,504 --> 00:21:15,670
I made you some tea.

289
00:21:15,672 --> 00:21:17,371
- Thank you.
- Thank you, that's nice.

290
00:21:17,373 --> 00:21:18,505
- So sweet.
- I'll trade you.

291
00:21:18,507 --> 00:21:19,572
Uh, okay.

292
00:21:21,274 --> 00:21:22,540
<i>Gracias.</i>

293
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:23,741
Excuse me.

294
00:21:48,732 --> 00:21:49,832
Oh, my God.

295
00:22:00,474 --> 00:22:01,841
Oh, sorry.

296
00:22:01,843 --> 00:22:04,743
We were trying to warm up.

297
00:22:04,745 --> 00:22:07,045
Yeah, I mean, we've
never seen one of these before.

298
00:22:07,047 --> 00:22:09,414
- A real one.
- It's okay.

299
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,682
Just be careful. It's old.

300
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:15,952
I see you've met Monkey.

301
00:22:15,954 --> 00:22:18,788
Yeah, this is Monkey.

302
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,824
It's time for Monkey
to go to bed.

303
00:22:21,826 --> 00:22:23,826
- Bye, Monkey.
- Night-night, Monkey.

304
00:22:23,828 --> 00:22:25,627
- Night-night.
- Sweet dreams.

305
00:22:25,629 --> 00:22:26,629
Bye, Monkey.

306
00:22:30,632 --> 00:22:31,752
All right, Monkey.

307
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:36,036
Go home, Monkey.

308
00:22:40,007 --> 00:22:42,541
You have so many records.

309
00:22:42,543 --> 00:22:44,342
Sorry. We had to try one.

310
00:22:44,344 --> 00:22:45,943
Stop apologizing, it's okay.

311
00:22:47,745 --> 00:22:50,613
I love this album.
You have good taste.

312
00:22:50,615 --> 00:22:52,748
This is like...

313
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,117
An insane collection.

314
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:57,652
- Yeah.
- It must be worth a fortune.

315
00:22:57,654 --> 00:23:00,087
Well, everything's
online now, so...

316
00:23:02,056 --> 00:23:05,691
But, uh, I love
the sound of vinyl.

317
00:23:05,693 --> 00:23:07,959
You're really into music.

318
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:10,494
Well, it used to be my job.

319
00:23:10,496 --> 00:23:12,863
What? Like a record salesman?

320
00:23:12,865 --> 00:23:15,832
I was a DJ.

321
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:17,133
Oh, my God. That's so cool!

322
00:23:17,135 --> 00:23:18,767
You're like Major Lazer!

323
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:23,604
It's really a hobby now,
I haven't had a real gig in years.

324
00:23:26,007 --> 00:23:27,807
Wait, how old are you?

325
00:23:28,642 --> 00:23:30,442
I'm 43.

326
00:23:30,444 --> 00:23:33,745
- No fucking way.
- I can't believe you're 43.

327
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:36,814
I thought you were, like,
28 or 30 at the most.

328
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:38,949
Well, I got married
when I was 30.

329
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,650
Where's your wife?

330
00:23:41,652 --> 00:23:43,718
She's at the beach with my kids.

331
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,089
We were gonna spend
Father's Day there, but, uh, work happened.

332
00:23:48,091 --> 00:23:50,558
Oh, my God, you are all
alone on Father's Day.

333
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,927
Poor Evan, we'll keep
you company!

334
00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:55,029
Hugs!

335
00:23:55,031 --> 00:23:57,431
No, it's fine.
We celebrated this morning.

336
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:01,501
Whoa, you're not 43.

337
00:24:01,503 --> 00:24:03,035
You must work out,
like, every day.

338
00:24:03,037 --> 00:24:05,437
Yeah, I keep in shape.

339
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:08,039
Not like when I was
in my 20s, but, uh...

340
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:13,177
Come on, any guy that ripped

341
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:15,045
is more into his own ass
than yours.

342
00:24:17,114 --> 00:24:19,982
Yeah, I mean, like, seriously,

343
00:24:19,984 --> 00:24:22,050
is that all you do?

344
00:24:22,052 --> 00:24:23,584
Oh, my God,

345
00:24:23,586 --> 00:24:25,018
I remember
I fucked this model once,

346
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,153
and while we were having sex

347
00:24:27,155 --> 00:24:29,088
I caught him doing
crunches in the mirror.

348
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:33,659
It was the gayest thing ever.

349
00:24:33,661 --> 00:24:38,429
I'd take somebody that's older and more
experienced over an Abercrombie model any day.

350
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,830
Yeah.

351
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:47,434
Well, hopefully one day
you'll find both.

352
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:51,103
I don't know.

353
00:24:51,105 --> 00:24:53,071
Underwear models are the kind of guys
you fuck when you're 14.

354
00:24:53,073 --> 00:24:55,039
That's a statement.

355
00:24:57,075 --> 00:24:59,042
- This is your wife?
- Yup.

356
00:24:59,044 --> 00:25:00,476
I want to see it.

357
00:25:02,612 --> 00:25:05,213
Wow! She's so pretty.

358
00:25:05,215 --> 00:25:07,615
She's beautiful.
You're a lucky guy.

359
00:25:07,617 --> 00:25:09,950
Yeah, I certainly am.

360
00:25:09,952 --> 00:25:12,752
I'm just an architect, but, uh,

361
00:25:12,754 --> 00:25:14,553
she's the real deal.

362
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:17,455
Most of what you see is hers.

363
00:25:18,723 --> 00:25:20,023
- She made all these?
- Yeah.

364
00:25:20,025 --> 00:25:21,025
Wow.

365
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:26,762
They're so pretty.

366
00:25:26,764 --> 00:25:28,730
I love these colors.

367
00:25:28,732 --> 00:25:30,231
Red's my favorite.

368
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:31,832
This is amazing.

369
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:34,034
I actually studied art history.

370
00:25:34,036 --> 00:25:36,556
I'm no expert, I was only
there for a semester, but,

371
00:25:37,705 --> 00:25:38,971
this...

372
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:43,941
This is like a Gaudi building,
but small.

373
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:48,511
Yeah, my wife loves Gaudi.

374
00:25:50,247 --> 00:25:52,648
She was, uh,
she was born in Barcelona.

375
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:53,949
Like me?

376
00:26:03,924 --> 00:26:06,659
English, English.
You guys sound too sexy.

377
00:26:08,194 --> 00:26:10,895
That's about the extent
of my Spanish anyway.

378
00:26:10,897 --> 00:26:13,063
My kids speak it perfectly.

379
00:26:14,965 --> 00:26:17,099
Your wife's an amazing artist.

380
00:26:17,101 --> 00:26:20,102
Why are these sculptures here?

381
00:26:20,104 --> 00:26:22,037
They should be in like, MOMA.

382
00:26:23,572 --> 00:26:25,606
Actually, um...

383
00:26:28,142 --> 00:26:29,976
It's not exactly MOMA...

384
00:26:32,245 --> 00:26:34,912
But she's having a big
gallery show in LA.

385
00:26:37,982 --> 00:26:40,750
Karen Alvarado.
That's such a pretty name.

386
00:26:40,752 --> 00:26:42,585
An architect and an artist.

387
00:26:42,587 --> 00:26:44,620
You guys
are like the perfect couple.

388
00:26:44,622 --> 00:26:47,556
And she's so hot.

389
00:26:47,558 --> 00:26:49,624
You must have sex,
like, all day.

390
00:26:49,626 --> 00:26:50,791
- Bel!
- What?

391
00:26:50,793 --> 00:26:52,659
I would.

392
00:26:52,661 --> 00:26:56,129
She sees a hot girl
and chases after her.

393
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:58,831
Well, it's okay.
I have no complaints.

394
00:26:59,933 --> 00:27:01,533
Sorry, I was just being honest.

395
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:05,603
No, no. It's fine.

396
00:27:05,605 --> 00:27:08,072
Um, but, uh...

397
00:27:08,873 --> 00:27:11,107
I must say

398
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:14,676
I'm not used to girls just
being so open about that.

399
00:27:15,811 --> 00:27:17,077
About what?

400
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:18,678
Sex?

401
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,047
No, I mean... Yes.

402
00:27:21,049 --> 00:27:22,615
- Yeah.
- Yes.

403
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:25,250
It's just sex.

404
00:27:27,786 --> 00:27:29,019
Right.

405
00:27:30,855 --> 00:27:32,889
Now you seem old.

406
00:27:37,293 --> 00:27:38,993
Sorry. So sorry.

407
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:57,810
Twenty minutes away.

408
00:27:57,812 --> 00:28:00,045
How long have you
and your wife been together?

409
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:05,149
I was 29 and she was 20.

410
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:07,317
It's been awhile.

411
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:10,154
So you haven't been
with anyone else in all those years?

412
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:11,955
Fourteen years, nope.

413
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:13,089
Wow.

414
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:16,058
How is that even possible?

415
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,760
Well, when you love someone...

416
00:28:18,762 --> 00:28:20,228
Come on, Evan.

417
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,930
Humans are the only species
that practice monogamy.

418
00:28:22,932 --> 00:28:25,766
I mean, we're animals.
We're more animals than animals.

419
00:28:25,768 --> 00:28:27,901
It's in our DNA.

420
00:28:27,903 --> 00:28:30,703
Like, being with one person
your whole life,

421
00:28:30,705 --> 00:28:32,905
is going against
your own nature.

422
00:28:36,743 --> 00:28:37,809
Look.

423
00:28:39,111 --> 00:28:40,845
It's like this.

424
00:28:40,847 --> 00:28:42,780
I understand men.

425
00:28:42,782 --> 00:28:44,815
I know whenever I get married,

426
00:28:44,817 --> 00:28:47,417
my husband is gonna want to be
with other girls.

427
00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:50,987
So, I want to get comfortable
with having threesomes now,

428
00:28:50,989 --> 00:28:54,290
because I know that's the only way
he'll never cheat on me.

429
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,000
Wow.

430
00:29:09,036 --> 00:29:11,437
So, are you guys...
What do you guys do?

431
00:29:11,439 --> 00:29:14,940
I mean, are you...
Are you in school or something?

432
00:29:14,942 --> 00:29:16,808
I mean...

433
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:19,177
Actually,
we're flight attendants.

434
00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:20,745
Really?

435
00:29:20,747 --> 00:29:22,446
What would you like
for your entree, sir?

436
00:29:22,448 --> 00:29:23,747
We have chicken...

437
00:29:24,482 --> 00:29:25,815
And pasta.

438
00:29:29,786 --> 00:29:31,419
Please buckle
your seatbelt, sir.

439
00:29:31,421 --> 00:29:34,121
We may be encountering
some turbulence.

440
00:29:38,992 --> 00:29:40,225
So...

441
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,260
Where you guys based out of?

442
00:29:43,262 --> 00:29:45,228
Everywhere.

443
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:47,263
Last weekend we were in
New Zealand for 24 hours.

444
00:29:47,265 --> 00:29:48,831
It was awesome.

445
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:51,466
Wow, how was that jet lag?

446
00:29:51,468 --> 00:29:53,901
We don't sleep.

447
00:29:53,903 --> 00:29:55,936
It's like being
a fake rock star.

448
00:29:55,938 --> 00:29:58,071
You know, you fly
around the world first class,

449
00:29:58,073 --> 00:30:00,406
drinks are on the house
and they pay you for it.

450
00:30:01,274 --> 00:30:03,908
I'm jealous.

451
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:06,043
I once got offered a tour
when I was a DJ.

452
00:30:06,045 --> 00:30:08,845
Not like you guys, but, uh,
Tri-State area.

453
00:30:10,981 --> 00:30:15,918
Yeah, well, I think traveling
is the best way to get life experience.

454
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,220
Especially when you're
only there for 24 hours.

455
00:30:18,222 --> 00:30:20,288
You really make the most of it.

456
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,390
Yeah, we make the most of it.

457
00:30:22,392 --> 00:30:25,493
Unlike that fucking
starfish we work with. Ugh.

458
00:30:25,495 --> 00:30:27,027
Ugh, starfish.

459
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:29,429
- Starfish?
- This girl we work with...

460
00:30:29,431 --> 00:30:31,230
She doesn't have to do
anything in bed,

461
00:30:31,232 --> 00:30:34,032
she just lies there
like a fucking starfish.

462
00:30:34,034 --> 00:30:36,234
Hence, starfish.

463
00:30:36,236 --> 00:30:37,935
I mean,
who'd want to fuck that?

464
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:41,171
I don't understand
girls like that.

465
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:45,008
When I'm with a guy,
I want him to have the time of his life.

466
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,209
- No rules.
- None.

467
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:48,844
Nothing's off limit, sexually.

468
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:51,346
Sex with boundaries
isn't really sex.

469
00:30:51,348 --> 00:30:53,848
If our bodies are capable
of doing it,

470
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,849
then we were meant to. Right?

471
00:31:11,598 --> 00:31:15,133
Oh, Evan?
Can I use your bathroom?

472
00:31:15,135 --> 00:31:18,603
Of course. It's, uh, down
the hall on the right.

473
00:31:19,137 --> 00:31:20,403
Thanks.

474
00:31:42,425 --> 00:31:45,059
I don't know any of these.

475
00:31:45,061 --> 00:31:47,428
Well, I have pretty
eclectic taste.

476
00:31:48,163 --> 00:31:50,964
You have Spanish music.

477
00:31:50,966 --> 00:31:53,066
Chilean, actually.

478
00:31:53,068 --> 00:31:55,228
My wife loves her,
Fran Valenzuela.

479
00:31:57,237 --> 00:31:58,604
Can you put it on?

480
00:31:59,505 --> 00:32:00,505
Sure.

481
00:32:07,645 --> 00:32:09,646
She's really talented.

482
00:32:09,648 --> 00:32:11,648
She started composing
when she was 13.

483
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:14,917
This is her third album.

484
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:37,396
Wow!

485
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:39,278
How did you know
that would mix?

486
00:33:40,365 --> 00:33:43,166
DJ'ing is like mixing a drink.

487
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:45,434
First you find
the right ingredients,

488
00:33:45,436 --> 00:33:47,468
then you find the blend.

489
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:53,473
Evan, I have something
to confess.

490
00:33:54,975 --> 00:33:56,375
Yes?

491
00:33:56,377 --> 00:33:58,577
I'm glad we knocked
on your door.

492
00:33:59,478 --> 00:34:01,645
I'm having a way better
time here

493
00:34:01,647 --> 00:34:04,607
then at that stupid party we were
supposed to go to.

494
00:34:06,417 --> 00:34:09,252
Well, I have to confess,
it's not usually this exciting around here

495
00:34:09,254 --> 00:34:10,653
at 1:30 in the morning.

496
00:34:15,091 --> 00:34:17,692
It's like destiny
that we were meant to meet.

497
00:34:19,695 --> 00:34:21,735
Do you believe in destiny, Evan?

498
00:34:27,468 --> 00:34:29,435
I'm an architect.

499
00:34:29,437 --> 00:34:33,004
So obviously I believe
that things happen by your own design.

500
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:36,273
Well, I do.

501
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:39,643
I don't think
people just meet randomly.

502
00:34:39,645 --> 00:34:43,213
I think that
if we are here, together,

503
00:34:44,181 --> 00:34:46,215
it's because

504
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:49,350
there's something we have to
learn from each other.

505
00:34:50,452 --> 00:34:51,618
Discover.

506
00:35:06,332 --> 00:35:07,565
It's here.

507
00:35:10,635 --> 00:35:12,502
I'll go get Genesis.

508
00:35:12,504 --> 00:35:14,437
I'll get your clothes.

509
00:35:22,779 --> 00:35:24,346
What the fuck!

510
00:35:37,727 --> 00:35:39,160
Guys!

511
00:35:41,229 --> 00:35:42,629
Guys, the car's outside.

512
00:35:46,233 --> 00:35:48,713
Guys, I have your clothes,
they're pretty much dry.

513
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,736
Guys!

514
00:35:53,638 --> 00:35:55,572
All right, I'm coming in,

515
00:35:55,574 --> 00:35:57,640
I'm not looking, so excuse me.

516
00:36:04,747 --> 00:36:06,667
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

517
00:36:07,382 --> 00:36:08,782
What the fuck are you doing?

518
00:36:08,784 --> 00:36:11,751
- Come on, Evan. Join us.
- Yeah, join the party.

519
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:14,553
- Come here.
- The car's outside.

520
00:36:14,555 --> 00:36:16,388
The car can wait. Come on.

521
00:36:18,424 --> 00:36:20,824
I'm gonna tell the driver
that you're coming out.

522
00:36:21,326 --> 00:36:22,626
Get dressed. Now.

523
00:36:22,628 --> 00:36:25,128
Please. Here's your clothes.

524
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,529
Evan. Look at us.

525
00:36:27,397 --> 00:36:28,730
Come on...

526
00:36:28,732 --> 00:36:30,631
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop. Stop. Stop.

527
00:36:30,633 --> 00:36:32,499
I can't do this.
I'm married.

528
00:36:32,501 --> 00:36:34,501
Happily. Okay?

529
00:36:34,503 --> 00:36:36,102
Yes. You can.

530
00:36:36,104 --> 00:36:37,870
Hey, it's our little secret.

531
00:36:37,872 --> 00:36:39,471
Whoa, stop. Stop.

532
00:36:39,473 --> 00:36:40,705
It's just sex.
We're all adults here.

533
00:36:40,707 --> 00:36:42,573
I'm flattered.

534
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:46,176
But really, I can't.
Please, get dressed.

535
00:36:46,178 --> 00:36:47,610
Yeah, you can.

536
00:36:47,612 --> 00:36:50,245
Come on, just one day.

537
00:36:50,247 --> 00:36:51,813
Just relax and enjoy it.

538
00:36:53,649 --> 00:36:55,316
You like this?

539
00:36:55,318 --> 00:36:57,599
Have you ever had two girls
do this to you before?

540
00:37:02,122 --> 00:37:04,362
- Happy Father's Day!
- Happy Father's Day!

541
00:40:21,883 --> 00:40:24,450
<i>It's time for the</i> Family Feud!

542
00:40:24,452 --> 00:40:26,919
<i>Introducing the Levy family!</i>

543
00:40:26,921 --> 00:40:28,954
- Morning, Daddy.
- Evan! Evan!

544
00:40:28,956 --> 00:40:29,956
Watch this!

545
00:40:33,826 --> 00:40:35,159
Belly! Belly! Catch! Catch!

546
00:40:38,764 --> 00:40:40,597
Sorry, Belly.

547
00:40:41,899 --> 00:40:43,532
I thought you guys left.

548
00:40:45,468 --> 00:40:47,735
- We made you breakky.
- I'm not hungry.

549
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:49,570
Monkey, that's mine.

550
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:53,040
<i>And the star of</i> Family Feud,
<i>Richard Dawson!</i>

551
00:41:02,849 --> 00:41:04,082
You two live together?

552
00:41:05,484 --> 00:41:06,484
Yeah.

553
00:41:07,051 --> 00:41:08,051
Where?

554
00:41:09,452 --> 00:41:10,452
Why, Evan?

555
00:41:12,154 --> 00:41:13,394
So I can drive you there.

556
00:41:15,524 --> 00:41:17,684
I haven't been home
in like four years.

557
00:41:19,094 --> 00:41:21,128
This could be our home.

558
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:23,210
I'll drive you
wherever you want.

559
00:41:25,899 --> 00:41:27,199
Did I say something funny?

560
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,866
Mmm-hmm.

561
00:41:30,034 --> 00:41:31,801
I want to go to Paris, Evan.

562
00:41:31,803 --> 00:41:34,069
No, let's go to Tokyo.

563
00:41:34,071 --> 00:41:36,171
London.

564
00:41:36,173 --> 00:41:37,972
Rome.

565
00:41:43,911 --> 00:41:45,951
Don't let your breakky get cold.

566
00:41:55,219 --> 00:41:56,919
Hey, baby.

567
00:41:56,921 --> 00:41:58,587
<i>Hey, you're alive.</i>

568
00:41:58,589 --> 00:42:01,756
Yeah, ah, barely.

569
00:42:01,758 --> 00:42:03,918
I forgot how strong
Vanessa's weed was.

570
00:42:04,626 --> 00:42:05,892
I just woke up.

571
00:42:05,894 --> 00:42:08,094
<i>You are such a lightweight.</i>

572
00:42:08,096 --> 00:42:10,229
- How are the kids?
<i>- Not so good.</i>

573
00:42:10,231 --> 00:42:11,964
- What happened?
- Evan!

574
00:42:11,966 --> 00:42:14,032
<i>Jake got stung by a jellyfish.
He was crying.</i>

575
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:16,633
- Oh, no!
<i>- Yeah.</i>

576
00:42:16,635 --> 00:42:17,934
Poor little guy.

577
00:42:17,936 --> 00:42:19,835
<i>- He's okay now.</i>
- Where is he?

578
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:21,670
<i>He's back at the beach.</i>

579
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:22,937
<i>It was a little bit hairy
for a while,</i>

580
00:42:22,939 --> 00:42:24,505
<i>but now he's okay.</i>

581
00:42:24,507 --> 00:42:26,139
<i>What about you?
How's your project?</i>

582
00:42:26,141 --> 00:42:29,142
Great. Great. Great.

583
00:42:29,144 --> 00:42:31,677
Uh, I'm in a really good
groove now,

584
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:33,145
so, home stretch.

585
00:42:34,514 --> 00:42:36,848
<i>Okay, then don't let me
interrupt you.</i>

586
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,950
<i>Let's talk later.
You seem a little distracted.</i>

587
00:42:38,952 --> 00:42:40,751
No. That's not what I meant.

588
00:42:40,753 --> 00:42:41,753
It's just...

589
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,555
so I don't have to think
about it, you know?

590
00:42:46,557 --> 00:42:48,256
Maybe if I get done early,
I can,

591
00:42:48,258 --> 00:42:49,957
I can drive out there.

592
00:42:49,959 --> 00:42:51,959
<i>Baby, I get it. Don't stress.</i>

593
00:42:51,961 --> 00:42:53,593
<i>Do what you have to do.</i>

594
00:42:53,595 --> 00:42:55,595
<i>- I love you.</i>
- Love you, too.

595
00:42:55,597 --> 00:42:58,064
<i>Don't smoke all our weed.</i>

596
00:42:58,066 --> 00:42:59,765
I won't. I promise.

597
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:02,473
- Bye.
<i>- Ciao.</i>

598
00:43:04,302 --> 00:43:07,637
Shit! Shit! Shit!

599
00:43:11,842 --> 00:43:13,209
Are you hungry now?

600
00:43:13,211 --> 00:43:15,611
Get up! And get dressed!

601
00:43:15,613 --> 00:43:17,045
Right now!

602
00:43:17,047 --> 00:43:19,180
Excuse me, sir.
Can you tell me where Evan is?

603
00:43:19,182 --> 00:43:21,682
You know, that sweet guy that
saved two girls from the rain?

604
00:43:21,684 --> 00:43:23,050
He's gone. Get the fuck up.

605
00:43:25,086 --> 00:43:26,719
Let's go.

606
00:43:26,721 --> 00:43:28,687
I don't appreciate
your tone of voice.

607
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,288
Go!

608
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:32,556
Come on, Belly. Looks like
Evan lost his sense of humor.

609
00:43:32,558 --> 00:43:34,891
Go!

610
00:43:44,101 --> 00:43:45,668
Hello!

611
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:46,670
Let's go!

612
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:53,807
Where's Bel?

613
00:43:53,809 --> 00:43:55,769
I don't know,
she's not my friend.

614
00:43:57,611 --> 00:43:58,611
Bel!

615
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:01,580
Bel!

616
00:44:06,618 --> 00:44:07,618
Bel?

617
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:14,290
What the fuck are you doing?

618
00:44:15,724 --> 00:44:17,925
You tell us to get dressed.

619
00:44:17,927 --> 00:44:20,060
Come on. Playtime's over.

620
00:44:20,062 --> 00:44:22,095
Evan, can you hold me?

621
00:44:22,097 --> 00:44:23,996
Please, just once more.

622
00:44:23,998 --> 00:44:25,864
- Please, I miss your hugs.
- Bel. Listen to me.

623
00:44:25,866 --> 00:44:27,832
You're leaving. Now.

624
00:44:27,834 --> 00:44:28,966
Get dressed.

625
00:44:28,968 --> 00:44:30,300
- I love you.
- Bel...

626
00:44:30,302 --> 00:44:31,902
- I love you.
- No!

627
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:36,071
I love you so much.

628
00:44:37,673 --> 00:44:39,340
God damn it! Fuck!

629
00:44:40,909 --> 00:44:43,944
I love you. I can't help it.

630
00:44:45,747 --> 00:44:46,912
I'm crazy about you.

631
00:44:53,986 --> 00:44:55,285
You have three minutes!

632
00:44:56,086 --> 00:44:57,219
I'll be outside!

633
00:44:58,854 --> 00:45:00,221
Get dressed!

634
00:45:08,763 --> 00:45:09,763
Let's go!

635
00:45:19,005 --> 00:45:23,174
What in the fuck
are you doing!

636
00:45:23,176 --> 00:45:26,677
You have any idea
what you've done?

637
00:45:26,679 --> 00:45:28,979
Yeah. It's called art.

638
00:45:28,981 --> 00:45:32,015
We were inspired
from last night. Remember?

639
00:45:32,017 --> 00:45:33,416
I'm calling the fucking police.

640
00:45:33,418 --> 00:45:34,884
Go ahead.

641
00:45:36,653 --> 00:45:38,186
What the fuck is so funny!

642
00:45:38,188 --> 00:45:40,421
I just have
a funny story for them.

643
00:45:40,423 --> 00:45:42,223
It's called
"To Catch a Predator."

644
00:45:47,428 --> 00:45:48,961
What the fuck are you
talking about?

645
00:45:48,963 --> 00:45:51,830
Fifteen to 20 years?

646
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,164
I think it is 20.

647
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:54,764
Fifteen gets you 20, right?

648
00:45:58,268 --> 00:46:00,269
- I don't believe it.
- You don't have to.

649
00:46:00,271 --> 00:46:01,937
The jury will.

650
00:46:01,939 --> 00:46:04,105
Statutory rape, Evan.

651
00:46:04,107 --> 00:46:05,873
Twenty years behind bars.

652
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:07,341
And that's just for one of us.

653
00:46:07,343 --> 00:46:09,543
And I'm not planning
on taking a shower.

654
00:46:11,779 --> 00:46:13,246
I have evidence.

655
00:46:15,082 --> 00:46:17,016
Really?

656
00:46:17,018 --> 00:46:19,578
So how could you be a flight
attendant if you're only 15?

657
00:46:22,888 --> 00:46:24,154
What the fuck! What?

658
00:46:25,189 --> 00:46:27,390
We saw that in a movie, Evan.

659
00:46:27,392 --> 00:46:29,291
I told you he'd believe it.

660
00:46:29,293 --> 00:46:31,793
Do you want to check my ID?

661
00:46:31,795 --> 00:46:33,755
She doesn't have one,
she's too young.

662
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,797
Okay.

663
00:46:37,799 --> 00:46:39,098
What do you want?

664
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,220
We want to make breakky
for you every morning.

665
00:46:41,267 --> 00:46:42,400
Come on.

666
00:46:42,402 --> 00:46:44,368
Just tell me.
How much do you want?

667
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:45,936
Don't be mad, Evan.

668
00:46:45,938 --> 00:46:47,804
That's not you.

669
00:46:47,806 --> 00:46:50,646
- You're different from the others.
- Yeah.

670
00:46:50,907 --> 00:46:51,941
How much!

671
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:56,912
What do you think we are,
hookers?

672
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:58,394
Jesus, Evan,
we're not fucking whores!

673
00:46:58,881 --> 00:47:00,014
Yeah.

674
00:47:00,016 --> 00:47:01,815
You're the fucking whore!

675
00:47:01,817 --> 00:47:03,583
Whore!

676
00:47:03,585 --> 00:47:05,952
Evan?

677
00:47:05,954 --> 00:47:07,019
It's Vivian!

678
00:47:08,121 --> 00:47:09,554
Do not move!

679
00:47:11,089 --> 00:47:12,155
Evan!

680
00:47:14,224 --> 00:47:15,991
Evan, I'm so sorry I'm late,

681
00:47:15,993 --> 00:47:18,426
but that storm blew
branches out all over town.

682
00:47:18,428 --> 00:47:20,961
It even knocked
two traffic lights out.

683
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,363
I swear, I swear I was sitting
there for 15 minutes

684
00:47:23,365 --> 00:47:25,565
and I was trying to navigate,
but there was repair trucks.

685
00:47:25,567 --> 00:47:27,266
It's fine. It's fine.

686
00:47:27,268 --> 00:47:29,334
Actually, I'm feeling
much better.

687
00:47:29,336 --> 00:47:30,601
Oh, then that's really good

688
00:47:30,603 --> 00:47:32,135
because then this'll help.

689
00:47:32,137 --> 00:47:33,169
I'll give you
a relaxation massage,

690
00:47:33,171 --> 00:47:34,503
it'll help circulate.

691
00:47:34,505 --> 00:47:36,438
Actually... Karen should have
told you,

692
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,506
I have a lot of work to do
this weekend.

693
00:47:38,508 --> 00:47:41,008
I love Karen. I love her
so much, how is she?

694
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:43,410
She is so talented.

695
00:47:43,412 --> 00:47:45,145
I cannot wait
to see her exhibition.

696
00:47:45,147 --> 00:47:46,546
In fact, you know what?

697
00:47:46,548 --> 00:47:47,947
Jim and I are going
to drive up for the opening

698
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:50,249
if I can get out
of that conference

699
00:47:50,251 --> 00:47:53,018
I have in Sonoma
with those massage therapists.

700
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:54,260
You know how that can be.

701
00:47:56,322 --> 00:47:57,588
He doesn't want your massage.

702
00:47:59,324 --> 00:48:00,390
Do you, baby?

703
00:48:02,993 --> 00:48:04,460
Get back inside.

704
00:48:05,361 --> 00:48:06,594
Don't let me get cold.

705
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:11,164
This is really upsetting, okay?

706
00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:12,431
I'm here to heal,

707
00:48:12,433 --> 00:48:15,066
but this is really...
This is upsetting!

708
00:48:15,068 --> 00:48:17,134
- It's upsetting!
- It's not what you think.

709
00:48:17,136 --> 00:48:19,002
No, no.
It's exactly what I think!

710
00:48:19,004 --> 00:48:20,203
But you know what?
It's your life.

711
00:48:20,205 --> 00:48:21,304
- Vivian, please.
- I... Don't.

712
00:48:21,306 --> 00:48:22,872
It's your relationship, Evan.

713
00:48:30,279 --> 00:48:32,580
Look, I'm a DJ like Evan!

714
00:48:32,582 --> 00:48:34,081
Why didn't you let
your girlfriend in?

715
00:48:34,083 --> 00:48:35,949
Are you ashamed of us?
Or are you fucking her, too?

716
00:48:35,951 --> 00:48:37,417
- Get out of my house!
- Be careful,

717
00:48:37,419 --> 00:48:39,485
these two cute little girls
can put you behind bars

718
00:48:39,487 --> 00:48:41,019
- for the rest of your life!
- Get out of my house!

719
00:48:41,021 --> 00:48:43,521
What would your client say?
Your neighbors?

720
00:48:43,523 --> 00:48:45,456
What would your wife say if we told
her everything we did last night?

721
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:46,557
Get out!

722
00:48:49,028 --> 00:48:51,228
It's gonna be such a shame
to see your wife divorce you!

723
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:52,596
And your business ruined

724
00:48:52,598 --> 00:48:54,631
over a single night
of perversion!

725
00:48:54,633 --> 00:48:56,165
You wanna go door-to-door
telling your neighbors

726
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:57,533
you're a child molester?

727
00:48:57,535 --> 00:48:59,201
What would the other parents do?

728
00:48:59,203 --> 00:49:01,603
Let their kids play here if
you're a convicted pedophile?

729
00:49:02,904 --> 00:49:04,337
There's Evan!

730
00:49:04,339 --> 00:49:05,471
There's Evan!

731
00:49:08,608 --> 00:49:10,688
I didn't think
you had it in you.

732
00:49:33,528 --> 00:49:35,362
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

733
00:49:35,364 --> 00:49:37,430
I'd like to report a break-in.

734
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:39,031
<i>You're calling from 458...</i>

735
00:49:42,301 --> 00:49:43,501
Can you give us a ride?

736
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:54,110
Let's go.

737
00:50:24,138 --> 00:50:26,105
Well, this isn't awkward at all.

738
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:27,272
Cool car, Evan.

739
00:50:38,381 --> 00:50:39,547
This one on the right.

740
00:50:40,982 --> 00:50:42,248
Out.

741
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:43,415
You're not gonna get out
and say bye?

742
00:50:43,417 --> 00:50:44,482
Go.

743
00:50:48,186 --> 00:50:50,306
Don't you want to come in
and meet my mom?

744
00:50:54,157 --> 00:50:56,291
- Oh!
- Bye!

745
00:50:56,293 --> 00:50:58,173
Send our love
to Karen and the kids!

746
00:50:58,660 --> 00:50:59,660
Bye!

747
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:20,196
Hello?

748
00:53:58,334 --> 00:53:59,534
Oh, my God!

749
00:54:43,609 --> 00:54:45,676
Oh!

750
00:54:49,614 --> 00:54:50,894
What the hell are you doing?

751
00:54:55,585 --> 00:54:57,785
Genesis, please,
this is crazy, untie me!

752
00:55:04,894 --> 00:55:06,727
What's the point of this?

753
00:55:08,563 --> 00:55:10,330
I'm a good person.

754
00:55:10,332 --> 00:55:11,431
I made a mistake.

755
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,220
We can forget
this ever happened.

756
00:55:16,235 --> 00:55:17,768
Please! Please!

757
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:21,090
Haven't you ever made a mistake?

758
00:55:43,355 --> 00:55:44,888
Daddy!

759
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:48,724
Oh, Daddy!

760
00:55:50,593 --> 00:55:52,794
Look what I found.

761
00:55:54,563 --> 00:55:55,629
Oh, my God!

762
00:55:56,530 --> 00:55:58,397
You take that off.

763
00:55:58,399 --> 00:56:00,439
That's my daughter's.
You take that off!

764
00:56:01,734 --> 00:56:03,601
You like how it fits me, Daddy?

765
00:56:04,603 --> 00:56:05,836
- Look.
- Take those off,

766
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:07,737
you fucking crazy bitch!

767
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:11,340
Okay.

768
00:56:15,911 --> 00:56:18,512
You know,
every girl's first love

769
00:56:19,647 --> 00:56:20,913
is their daddy, huh?

770
00:56:25,651 --> 00:56:26,917
You're sick.

771
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:29,885
You like what you see?

772
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:33,355
Huh?
You like what you see?

773
00:56:33,357 --> 00:56:34,422
Daddy?

774
00:56:43,565 --> 00:56:44,998
- Huh?
- No.

775
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Bel.

776
00:56:46,967 --> 00:56:48,033
Untie me.

777
00:56:48,801 --> 00:56:50,635
Untie me, please.

778
00:56:50,637 --> 00:56:52,803
If you really love me,

779
00:56:53,704 --> 00:56:54,770
untie me.

780
00:56:56,606 --> 00:56:57,726
Ignore that asshole.

781
00:56:58,607 --> 00:56:59,727
He's not an asshole.

782
00:57:00,508 --> 00:57:01,741
He's my Daddy.

783
00:57:05,779 --> 00:57:08,180
You don't listen to her, Daddy.

784
00:57:08,182 --> 00:57:10,142
She doesn't love you
the way I do.

785
00:57:10,516 --> 00:57:12,583
I love you, Daddy.

786
00:57:12,585 --> 00:57:15,852
I've loved you ever since
Mommy brought you home.

787
00:57:15,854 --> 00:57:18,087
Remember that night
when we were all alone

788
00:57:18,089 --> 00:57:19,455
and you snuck into my room?

789
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:23,057
And I pretended to be asleep.

790
00:57:23,059 --> 00:57:24,858
But when you took off
my clothes,

791
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:27,093
I couldn't pretend any longer.

792
00:57:27,095 --> 00:57:29,862
We did things
you and Mommy never did.

793
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,999
I hope you're not angry
at me anymore, Daddy.

794
00:57:35,468 --> 00:57:37,035
I only did that to Mommy

795
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:39,037
because I wanted you
all to myself.

796
00:57:40,639 --> 00:57:43,674
Bel, Bel, untie me, please?

797
00:57:44,542 --> 00:57:46,743
Please.

798
00:57:46,745 --> 00:57:48,905
You can tuck me in
like you always did.

799
00:57:54,851 --> 00:57:55,971
What's wrong, Daddy?

800
00:57:56,685 --> 00:57:57,751
Huh?

801
00:57:59,019 --> 00:58:01,620
Don't you want to fuck
your little girl again?

802
00:58:01,622 --> 00:58:03,903
Did you forget what you did
to me all those years?

803
00:58:05,157 --> 00:58:06,624
Why did you do that to me?

804
00:58:07,959 --> 00:58:09,659
Why did you do that to me!

805
00:58:09,661 --> 00:58:11,101
- Bel...
- Why?

806
00:58:13,597 --> 00:58:15,030
Stop! Bel!

807
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,966
Stop! Bel!

808
00:58:18,968 --> 00:58:20,033
Bel, stop!

809
00:58:20,035 --> 00:58:22,502
Why did you do that to me!

810
00:58:22,504 --> 00:58:24,670
Why!
Why did you do that to me!

811
00:58:24,672 --> 00:58:26,071
Stop! Stop!

812
00:58:26,073 --> 00:58:28,106
Bel! Stop, please!

813
00:58:28,108 --> 00:58:29,974
Stop it! Stop it!

814
00:58:42,486 --> 00:58:43,486
Shh.

815
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:46,522
Untie me.

816
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:52,127
What the fuck is that?

817
00:58:55,065 --> 00:58:57,065
You're not hiding something,
are you, Evan?

818
00:58:59,568 --> 00:59:01,035
What are you hiding here, huh?

819
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,669
Come on, where is it, Daddy?

820
00:59:05,673 --> 00:59:07,940
It's Karen on FaceTime!

821
00:59:07,942 --> 00:59:09,708
- I've been dying to meet her.
- Answer it.

822
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:11,543
- Let's get to know her.
- No! No!

823
00:59:11,545 --> 00:59:13,305
You're right,
this could get awkward.

824
00:59:14,179 --> 00:59:15,779
- What are you doing?
- Much better.

825
00:59:15,781 --> 00:59:17,514
Don't!

826
00:59:17,516 --> 00:59:19,148
Can a cock answer an iPhone?

827
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:20,682
Yes, Belly,
but it's gotta be hard.

828
00:59:20,684 --> 00:59:21,949
Okay.

829
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:24,884
No! Please!

830
00:59:24,886 --> 00:59:27,586
- It could be my kids!
- Hi Evan, welcome back.

831
00:59:27,588 --> 00:59:29,621
So? Have they ever seen
a cheating dick before?

832
00:59:29,623 --> 00:59:31,756
How about covered
in her lipstick?

833
00:59:31,758 --> 00:59:34,724
Okay! Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay. Please.

834
00:59:36,593 --> 00:59:38,994
Bel, I'll do whatever you want.

835
00:59:38,996 --> 00:59:40,261
Yes! Yes!

836
00:59:42,731 --> 00:59:44,264
Okay. Okay.

837
00:59:44,266 --> 00:59:46,733
Now, fuck me, Daddy!

838
00:59:46,735 --> 00:59:49,068
- Fuck me!
- Attaboy, Evan.

839
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:50,202
Fuck her.

840
00:59:50,204 --> 00:59:52,671
Fuck her
like it was last night.

841
00:59:52,673 --> 00:59:53,838
Yeah, fuck her good!

842
00:59:54,941 --> 00:59:56,573
Fuck me, Daddy!

843
00:59:56,575 --> 00:59:58,942
Fuck me like you fuck
your little daughter!

844
01:00:02,245 --> 01:00:03,878
Doggy style, Belly!

845
01:00:09,583 --> 01:00:11,583
You want something to eat, Bel?

846
01:00:11,785 --> 01:00:12,785
No, I'm okay.

847
01:00:13,219 --> 01:00:15,019
Okay.

848
01:00:19,722 --> 01:00:21,322
Fuck me, Daddy!

849
01:00:21,324 --> 01:00:22,890
Fuck me like you fuck Mommy!

850
01:00:37,169 --> 01:00:39,770
Yeah, Daddy's little girl!

851
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,007
You're a good little girl!

852
01:00:46,277 --> 01:00:48,577
- Fuck me, Daddy!
- Yeah!

853
01:00:48,579 --> 01:00:50,312
Fuck me like you fuck Mommy!

854
01:00:54,783 --> 01:00:55,849
Ow!

855
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:33,216
Arghh!

856
01:01:34,718 --> 01:01:36,685
My scar! My scar! My scar!

857
01:01:36,687 --> 01:01:38,920
My surgery!

858
01:01:38,922 --> 01:01:41,155
You've been
a very bad boy, Evan!

859
01:01:41,157 --> 01:01:43,517
Please, please, please
take it out! Take it out!

860
01:01:44,859 --> 01:01:47,760
Oh, my God!

861
01:01:47,762 --> 01:01:48,927
Oh, my...

862
01:01:49,862 --> 01:01:50,928
...God!

863
01:01:55,933 --> 01:01:58,067
Why did you hit me, Daddy?

864
01:01:58,069 --> 01:01:59,349
Now we have to punish you.

865
01:02:21,789 --> 01:02:25,724
Welcome to America's
favorite game show,

866
01:02:25,726 --> 01:02:28,760
<i>Who Wants to be a Pedophile!</i>

867
01:02:28,762 --> 01:02:31,763
Where we give the audience
what they want!

868
01:02:31,765 --> 01:02:33,865
The chance to punish
a pedophile.

869
01:02:33,867 --> 01:02:35,833
But first,

870
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:38,936
let's welcome our lovely,
beautiful and charming,

871
01:02:38,938 --> 01:02:41,171
Ms. Bel!

872
01:02:43,841 --> 01:02:45,040
Hello, Ms. Bel.

873
01:02:47,743 --> 01:02:49,210
For tonight's contestant,

874
01:02:49,212 --> 01:02:50,811
we have a very special one,

875
01:02:50,813 --> 01:02:53,146
he's not only an architect
but also a DJ,

876
01:02:53,148 --> 01:02:55,815
a husband, a father of two,

877
01:02:55,817 --> 01:02:56,882
possibly three.

878
01:02:56,884 --> 01:02:59,284
Four.

879
01:02:59,286 --> 01:03:02,353
All the way from

880
01:03:02,355 --> 01:03:05,255
Mr. Evan Webber!

881
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:11,160
Ms. Bel, would you please
get our contestant ready?

882
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,261
Sure.

883
01:03:24,373 --> 01:03:26,493
You're both crazy
fucking bitches!

884
01:03:28,243 --> 01:03:29,943
You look 21, you lied to me!

885
01:03:29,945 --> 01:03:31,945
Oh, like you lied to your wife?

886
01:03:32,379 --> 01:03:34,499
What I tell my wife is
none of your goddamn...

887
01:03:35,749 --> 01:03:38,216
God! God!

888
01:03:38,218 --> 01:03:41,285
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
My ears! My ears!

889
01:03:41,287 --> 01:03:43,120
I'll go deaf! I'll go deaf!

890
01:03:45,356 --> 01:03:46,823
This is fucking serious!

891
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:49,424
I could go deaf!

892
01:03:49,426 --> 01:03:51,025
The game hasn't started yet.

893
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:56,530
Our first category...

01:03:59,534 --> 01:04:00,934
Schoolyards.

895
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:04,937
How far away from school

896
01:04:04,939 --> 01:04:07,039
will Evan have
to pick up his kids?

897
01:04:07,041 --> 01:04:08,106
100 yards?

898
01:04:09,108 --> 01:04:10,208
500 yards?

899
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:12,376
Or two miles?

900
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:18,114
This is fucking sick!

901
01:04:21,918 --> 01:04:22,918
Arghh!

902
01:04:26,355 --> 01:04:28,555
Wrong answer.
Correct answer is

903
01:04:28,557 --> 01:04:30,857
you can't pick up
your kids from prison.

904
01:04:30,859 --> 01:04:32,959
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

905
01:04:32,961 --> 01:04:34,260
Please!

906
01:04:34,262 --> 01:04:35,995
What's our next category,
Ms. Bel?

907
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:37,429
I love this one.

908
01:04:43,102 --> 01:04:44,469
Daddies.

909
01:04:46,939 --> 01:04:49,140
Evan, this should be
easy for you.

910
01:04:50,575 --> 01:04:53,376
How many family men
have survived this game?

911
01:04:58,915 --> 01:04:59,915
None.

912
01:05:02,518 --> 01:05:03,518
What was that?

913
01:05:04,619 --> 01:05:05,885
None.

914
01:05:05,887 --> 01:05:07,386
Correct!

915
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:13,057
- Next question.
- Genesis.

916
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:16,059
You've proved your point.

917
01:05:19,664 --> 01:05:22,131
God! I can't hear!
I can't hear!

918
01:05:23,032 --> 01:05:25,566
Please stop!

919
01:05:25,568 --> 01:05:27,928
All you have to do is
answer the question, Evan.

920
01:05:28,669 --> 01:05:29,669
Okay.

921
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:31,436
Okay.

922
01:05:35,174 --> 01:05:38,109
Well, ask it, for fuck's sake!

923
01:05:38,111 --> 01:05:40,644
What's the proper punishment
for a pedophile?

924
01:05:40,646 --> 01:05:43,680
Is it prison where
you get raped every day

925
01:05:43,682 --> 01:05:45,648
and you never get to see
your family again?

926
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:46,915
Castration?

927
01:05:47,683 --> 01:05:48,683
Or death?

928
01:05:57,491 --> 01:06:01,360
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
Tick-tick-tock.

929
01:06:01,362 --> 01:06:03,562
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

930
01:06:04,363 --> 01:06:05,496
Ten seconds.

931
01:06:07,065 --> 01:06:14,003
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

932
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:18,607
Well, looks like it's time for
our first commercial break.

933
01:06:18,609 --> 01:06:21,209
We'll be back after a message
from our sponsors.

934
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:23,244
Hello. It's me, Louis!

935
01:06:23,246 --> 01:06:24,545
Mr. Webber?

936
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:31,550
Who's Louis?

937
01:06:35,553 --> 01:06:37,086
Fucking douche bag.

938
01:06:38,388 --> 01:06:40,389
Get that sheet, cover him up.

939
01:06:48,297 --> 01:06:49,362
Shh!

940
01:07:00,373 --> 01:07:01,506
- You must be Louis.
- Yes.

941
01:07:01,508 --> 01:07:03,107
I'm Bernadette.
I'm Uncle Evan's niece.

942
01:07:03,109 --> 01:07:04,441
Oh, hi, nice to meet you.

943
01:07:04,443 --> 01:07:06,743
Obviously, you're with
Uncle Evan.

944
01:07:06,745 --> 01:07:09,112
Sorry, we're shooting
a music video.

945
01:07:09,114 --> 01:07:11,234
Well, you guys picked
an awesome location.

946
01:07:11,715 --> 01:07:12,715
Come on in.

947
01:07:16,485 --> 01:07:18,586
So where'd you come in from?

948
01:07:18,588 --> 01:07:21,288
- Dallas.
- Oh? I used to live in Austin.

949
01:07:21,290 --> 01:07:22,522
Oh, I've never been.

950
01:07:22,524 --> 01:07:24,223
Well, it's fun when
you're in college.

951
01:07:24,225 --> 01:07:26,158
Yeah, I went to Parsons.

952
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,359
Oh, great school.

953
01:07:27,361 --> 01:07:28,693
I went to SVA.

954
01:07:28,695 --> 01:07:30,094
- Hi.
- Hi.

955
01:07:30,096 --> 01:07:32,429
- I'm Louis.
- Hi.

956
01:07:32,431 --> 01:07:34,397
- Hi. I'm...
- She's Macarena.

957
01:07:34,399 --> 01:07:36,999
- She's my friend from Spain.
- -Oh.

958
01:07:38,602 --> 01:07:40,702
- He's here to pick up...
- The art work outside.

959
01:07:40,704 --> 01:07:42,304
- Yes.
- Excuse me.

960
01:07:51,645 --> 01:07:53,345
- Somebody touch this?
- We didn't touch it.

961
01:07:53,347 --> 01:07:55,146
It's Aunt Karen's stuff,
we wouldn't go near it.

962
01:07:55,148 --> 01:07:57,047
I did see Evan in here earlier,

963
01:07:57,049 --> 01:07:58,148
maybe he did.

964
01:08:00,151 --> 01:08:01,584
Okay,

965
01:08:01,586 --> 01:08:03,652
'cause it's not supposed
to be like this.

966
01:08:03,654 --> 01:08:06,254
It's supposed to be bubble-wrapped
and packed up and ready to go.

967
01:08:06,256 --> 01:08:08,456
- Why would Evan do this?
- She said it wasn't us.

968
01:08:10,158 --> 01:08:11,158
Okay.

969
01:08:18,765 --> 01:08:20,398
Oh, fuck.

970
01:08:21,466 --> 01:08:22,532
Oh, my God.

971
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:26,568
What the fuck did y'all do?

972
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:27,810
What the fuck is this shit!

973
01:08:42,249 --> 01:08:43,816
We didn't want to tell you,
someone broke in

974
01:08:43,818 --> 01:08:45,083
and that's why Evan's out.

975
01:08:45,085 --> 01:08:46,451
- He was chasing them.
- Yeah.

976
01:08:46,453 --> 01:08:47,618
Shut the fuck up!

977
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:49,419
Shut the fuck up,
both of you right now!

978
01:08:49,421 --> 01:08:50,553
Nobody fucking move!

979
01:08:52,656 --> 01:08:54,496
I'm calling the cops right now.

980
01:08:55,358 --> 01:08:56,624
Please don't tell Karen.

981
01:08:59,794 --> 01:09:01,834
This could be our little secret.

982
01:09:05,298 --> 01:09:07,498
Bitch, you're barking up
the wrong fucking tree.

983
01:09:08,401 --> 01:09:10,268
I'm from Oakland, ho!

984
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:13,070
I know two ghetto ass
hos when I see 'em!

985
01:09:13,072 --> 01:09:15,105
Come to think of it,
Evan doesn't even have any fucking nieces.

986
01:09:15,107 --> 01:09:17,774
Who the fuck are you?

987
01:09:17,776 --> 01:09:20,343
You better hope the police
get here before Karen does.

988
01:09:22,779 --> 01:09:24,479
- What the fuck was that?
- Nothing.

989
01:09:24,481 --> 01:09:26,080
- Hey, wait.
- Wait.

990
01:09:26,082 --> 01:09:27,681
- It's nothing.
- Get out of my way!

991
01:09:27,683 --> 01:09:29,249
Shit.

992
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:35,286
Shit!

993
01:09:36,388 --> 01:09:38,355
Mr. Webber!

994
01:09:38,357 --> 01:09:39,756
Are you okay? Oh, fuck!

995
01:09:39,758 --> 01:09:41,257
They're crazy!

996
01:09:41,259 --> 01:09:42,691
Close the door.
Close the door.

997
01:09:42,693 --> 01:09:43,825
Louis!

998
01:09:45,328 --> 01:09:49,129
- I gotta stop these crazy ass bitches.
- Louis, forget it!

999
01:09:49,131 --> 01:09:50,663
They're dangerous!

1000
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:58,102
No! No! Stop!

1001
01:09:58,104 --> 01:09:59,436
Stop it!

1002
01:09:59,438 --> 01:10:00,670
What are you doing!

1003
01:10:14,349 --> 01:10:15,681
Looking for this?

1004
01:10:18,818 --> 01:10:21,519
Louis! Be careful!

1005
01:10:21,521 --> 01:10:23,554
They're crazy!

1006
01:10:23,556 --> 01:10:27,291
Monkey in the middle!
Monkey in the middle!

1007
01:10:27,293 --> 01:10:28,792
We can't say
that, Belly, it's racist.

1008
01:10:28,794 --> 01:10:30,527
Okay, man in the middle!

1009
01:10:31,495 --> 01:10:32,862
Give it to him!

1010
01:10:32,864 --> 01:10:34,463
No, Genesis, give him that!

1011
01:10:36,266 --> 01:10:37,565
Louis!

1012
01:10:39,901 --> 01:10:41,302
Louis!

1013
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:53,446
Genesis! Please, this isn't his fault!
Please call an ambulance, help him!

1014
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:57,683
Fucker!

1015
01:10:57,685 --> 01:10:59,418
Bel, please help him!

1016
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:02,921
Call an ambulance, I promise
I won't say anything!

1017
01:11:02,923 --> 01:11:06,524
Bel, Genesis! Call an ambulance,
for fuck's sake!

1018
01:11:06,526 --> 01:11:08,759
I think it's a little late
for an ambulance, Evan.

1019
01:11:08,761 --> 01:11:11,895
He tripped, it's his fault.

1020
01:11:11,897 --> 01:11:13,997
We were just playing
monkey in the middle.

1021
01:11:13,999 --> 01:11:15,631
I mean, man in the middle.

1022
01:11:16,499 --> 01:11:18,333
Oh, my God!

1023
01:11:21,637 --> 01:11:23,270
You killed him!

1024
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:25,605
You killed him!

1025
01:11:25,607 --> 01:11:28,674
Your wife killed him
with her shitty sculpture.

1026
01:11:28,676 --> 01:11:30,575
This shit's dangerous, Evan.

1027
01:11:30,577 --> 01:11:32,743
How can you keep
this here with kids?

1028
01:11:32,745 --> 01:11:34,611
That's irresponsible parenting.

1029
01:11:34,613 --> 01:11:36,613
Yeah maybe your wife
should stick to painting.

1030
01:11:36,615 --> 01:11:38,648
Get the fuck away from me!

1031
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:40,016
Where do you think
you're going, Evan?

1032
01:11:40,018 --> 01:11:41,784
Get the fuck off me!
Leave me alone!

1033
01:11:41,786 --> 01:11:43,352
Wanna go for a little ride?

1034
01:11:43,354 --> 01:11:44,853
You can't run away
from us, Daddy.

1035
01:11:44,855 --> 01:11:46,621
You can't escape.

1036
01:11:48,057 --> 01:11:49,322
Ahhh!

1037
01:11:51,558 --> 01:11:54,760
This is what happens when you break
the rules of the game, Evan.

1038
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:16,980
This is just like art class.

1039
01:12:57,454 --> 01:12:59,421
<i>What I did to Karen's statue</i>

1040
01:12:59,423 --> 01:13:01,623
<i>is nothing compared
to what I'm going to do to you</i>

1041
01:13:01,625 --> 01:13:04,592
<i>if I ever see your
fucking lying face again.</i>

1042
01:13:04,594 --> 01:13:07,061
<i>I trusted you both,
how could you fuck my wife?</i>

1043
01:13:08,596 --> 01:13:13,433
<i>Never come
near my family again.</i>

1044
01:13:13,435 --> 01:13:16,636
<i>Disappear or you're
fucking dead.</i>

1045
01:13:27,144 --> 01:13:28,878
Which way is MOMA?

1046
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:32,481
It's more like "momma."

1047
01:13:39,688 --> 01:13:41,989
Ronnie is gonna have
a field day with this one.

1048
01:13:41,991 --> 01:13:43,724
Yeah, I'm sure he will.

1049
01:13:46,027 --> 01:13:47,761
That guy's a magician.

1050
01:13:47,763 --> 01:13:49,796
Yeah.

1051
01:13:49,798 --> 01:13:51,731
He can make anything disappear.

1052
01:13:51,733 --> 01:13:52,932
Let's finish this.

1053
01:14:09,147 --> 01:14:12,048
Wow, those were some
really long commercials.

1054
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:15,084
Thanks to our sponsor Louis
for that little lovely break.

1055
01:14:21,524 --> 01:14:25,927
Now! Back to our
million dollar question.

1056
01:14:27,195 --> 01:14:30,029
What is the proper punishment
for a pedophile?

1057
01:14:31,865 --> 01:14:33,966
Please.

1058
01:14:33,968 --> 01:14:36,969
I love my children.
I love my wife.

1059
01:14:36,971 --> 01:14:39,004
I'm a good father.

1060
01:14:39,006 --> 01:14:41,539
How can you judge anyone?

1061
01:14:41,541 --> 01:14:42,640
You're murderers.

1062
01:14:42,642 --> 01:14:44,642
Is that your final answer?

1063
01:14:44,644 --> 01:14:46,777
Cause you're gonna go deaf
in about 10 seconds from now.

1064
01:14:46,779 --> 01:14:48,478
Please, Genesis!

1065
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,012
I'm a good father!

1066
01:14:50,014 --> 01:14:51,480
Until yesterday.

1067
01:14:51,482 --> 01:14:53,562
That doesn't change
how much I love them!

1068
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:05,690
Do you really love them, Evan?

1069
01:15:07,659 --> 01:15:08,725
Really?

1070
01:15:10,794 --> 01:15:12,834
More than anything in the world.

1071
01:15:14,863 --> 01:15:17,564
So why didn't you think of
them when you were inside us?

1072
01:15:17,566 --> 01:15:18,731
Yeah, why, Evan?

1073
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:23,101
Last night had nothing
to do with my family.

1074
01:15:23,103 --> 01:15:25,203
Damn right it didn't, Evan!

1075
01:15:25,205 --> 01:15:27,805
It had nothing
to do with them.

1076
01:15:27,807 --> 01:15:29,940
Your family are victims.

1077
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:33,043
Victims of your sleazy, disgusting,
perverted behavior.

1078
01:15:33,644 --> 01:15:35,578
Jake. Lisa.

1079
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:39,614
They don't deserve
a father like you.

1080
01:15:39,616 --> 01:15:41,656
This is what you did
to your family.

1081
01:15:43,485 --> 01:15:44,718
You pervert.

1082
01:15:50,257 --> 01:15:52,658
Genesis, please,
this isn't the answer!

1083
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:54,026
Wrong answer.

1084
01:15:54,894 --> 01:15:57,128
Correct answer is death.

1085
01:15:59,531 --> 01:16:01,491
We'll be back
after this commercial break.

1086
01:16:04,601 --> 01:16:05,667
Death?

1087
01:16:06,702 --> 01:16:08,069
Death?

1088
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:10,971
You're gonna kill me?

1089
01:16:10,973 --> 01:16:13,907
You're gonna fucking kill me!

1090
01:16:13,909 --> 01:16:17,577
Why? Why!
Because I fucked you?

1091
01:16:17,579 --> 01:16:20,212
You fucked me!
You fucked me!

1092
01:16:20,214 --> 01:16:24,216
You came to my house!
You came to me!

1093
01:16:24,218 --> 01:16:26,518
I got you a car,
I brought you your clothes,

1094
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,820
you took a fucking bubble bath!

1095
01:16:28,822 --> 01:16:32,790
You wanted it! You wanted it!
You came on to me!

1096
01:16:32,792 --> 01:16:34,691
What was I supposed to do?

1097
01:16:34,693 --> 01:16:38,161
You sucked my cock, you both
fucking sucked my cock!

1098
01:16:38,163 --> 01:16:42,064
It was free pizza!
Free fucking pizza!

1099
01:16:42,066 --> 01:16:44,166
It just shows up
at my fucking door!

1100
01:16:44,168 --> 01:16:46,201
What am I supposed to do?

1101
01:16:46,203 --> 01:16:49,270
"We're flight attendants.
Come on, fuck us!

1102
01:16:49,272 --> 01:16:52,239
"No one will know.
Come on, fuck us!"

1103
01:16:52,241 --> 01:16:55,575
Oh, twosomes, threesomes.
It doesn't matter!

1104
01:16:55,577 --> 01:16:58,611
Starfish! Husbands!
You don't give a fuck,

1105
01:16:58,613 --> 01:17:01,614
you'll just fuck anything,
you'll just fuck anything!

1106
01:17:01,616 --> 01:17:03,716
Well, you lied to me,
I tried to help you!

1107
01:17:03,718 --> 01:17:05,050
I let you in,

1108
01:17:05,052 --> 01:17:07,952
I was a good guy,
I'm a good father!

1109
01:17:07,954 --> 01:17:10,220
And you just fucking fucked me!

1110
01:17:10,222 --> 01:17:12,889
What?
Now, you're gonna kill me!

1111
01:17:12,891 --> 01:17:14,891
You're gonna kill me? Why?

1112
01:17:14,893 --> 01:17:17,226
Why? 'Cause you fucked me?

1113
01:17:17,228 --> 01:17:20,262
What the fuck-fuck-fuck,
this is fucking insane!

1114
01:17:25,701 --> 01:17:27,601
You're to be executed at dawn.

1115
01:17:31,572 --> 01:17:33,606
If I were you,

1116
01:17:33,608 --> 01:17:36,575
I wouldn't waste my last
few hours crying about it.

1117
01:17:39,946 --> 01:17:41,112
I'm sorry, Daddy.

1118
01:17:43,849 --> 01:17:45,082
It is the only way.

1119
01:17:47,652 --> 01:17:48,718
Bel?

1120
01:17:55,858 --> 01:17:58,125
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1121
01:17:59,193 --> 01:18:00,693
Oh, my God!

1122
01:19:06,023 --> 01:19:08,324
FaceTime. Karen!

1123
01:19:10,226 --> 01:19:11,960
FaceTime. Karen.

1124
01:19:13,929 --> 01:19:16,196
Digging a grave
is fucking tiring.

1125
01:19:16,198 --> 01:19:17,797
And filthy.

1126
01:19:17,799 --> 01:19:19,265
Your wife's clothes
are gonna need dry cleaning.

1127
01:19:19,267 --> 01:19:20,267
What's that?

1128
01:19:23,237 --> 01:19:25,103
You can't have access
to an iPad, Evan.

1129
01:19:25,105 --> 01:19:27,185
You could be trying
to reach a child.

1130
01:19:32,743 --> 01:19:35,978
Let's face it, Evan.
You're a monster.

1131
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:38,914
Or should I say monster!

1132
01:19:40,784 --> 01:19:41,784
What?

1133
01:19:43,017 --> 01:19:45,151
Monster surprised?

1134
01:19:45,153 --> 01:19:46,952
How do you know about that?

1135
01:19:46,954 --> 01:19:48,720
Oh, monster confused!

1136
01:19:49,888 --> 01:19:51,288
How the fuck do you know that!

1137
01:19:51,290 --> 01:19:53,255
Monster will be quiet!

1138
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:56,991
You spied on me?

1139
01:19:58,994 --> 01:19:59,994
On my kids?

1140
01:20:01,062 --> 01:20:02,796
Oh, my fucking God!

1141
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:04,831
Oh, my fucking God! Jesus!

1142
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:06,432
I'm so fucking stupid!

1143
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:07,434
Yeah, you are.

1144
01:20:12,271 --> 01:20:15,039
Monster retarded.

1145
01:20:18,477 --> 01:20:20,276
Let's change, I feel gross.

1146
01:20:24,381 --> 01:20:25,914
Look at all this shit.

1147
01:20:36,292 --> 01:20:38,925
<i>This is you, Evan.</i>

1148
01:20:38,927 --> 01:20:42,087
This is gonna be your little fucking head,
you fucking cheater!

1149
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:47,231
I love this color!
Red's my favorite!

1150
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:22,393
No! No!
Gotta be pretty for your funeral.

1151
01:21:22,395 --> 01:21:23,894
He's so hairy.

1152
01:21:23,896 --> 01:21:25,095
No!

1153
01:21:25,097 --> 01:21:26,896
You don't wanna lose an ear.

1154
01:21:26,898 --> 01:21:27,898
Hold still.

1155
01:21:29,299 --> 01:21:31,533
There we go.
You look pretty.

1156
01:21:31,535 --> 01:21:33,401
There's Evan cutie!

1157
01:21:38,206 --> 01:21:39,439
There you have it.

1158
01:21:42,943 --> 01:21:44,877
Oh, now we see
your pretty face.

1159
01:21:44,879 --> 01:21:46,245
Fucking bitches!

1160
01:21:53,919 --> 01:21:56,119
"I love the sound
of vinyl. I'm Evan."

1161
01:21:59,156 --> 01:22:00,156
Watch this, Evan.

1162
01:22:19,604 --> 01:22:20,670
Jackpot!

1163
01:22:25,176 --> 01:22:26,308
Is that real?

1164
01:22:28,511 --> 01:22:32,680
What a clever way to hide
this from the kids, Evan!

1165
01:22:32,682 --> 01:22:36,016
You know, most firearm deaths are
a family member of the gun owner.

1166
01:22:38,519 --> 01:22:39,685
I don't own a gun.

1167
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:42,086
It's dangerous.

1168
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:46,590
Untie him.

1169
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:51,093
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1170
01:22:57,566 --> 01:22:59,600
Genesis, please don't
point that at me.

1171
01:22:59,602 --> 01:23:01,201
I know,

1172
01:23:01,203 --> 01:23:03,369
it's cheating.
We still have 90 minutes.

1173
01:23:03,371 --> 01:23:06,171
But you were keeping secrets
from us, Evan.

1174
01:23:06,173 --> 01:23:08,306
Had you gotten to this before us

1175
01:23:08,308 --> 01:23:11,075
I don't think we'd be
having this conversation.

1176
01:23:11,077 --> 01:23:12,176
And you wouldn't do the same?

1177
01:23:12,178 --> 01:23:14,244
I'm not like you, Evan.

1178
01:23:14,246 --> 01:23:17,146
I don't own a gun,
I don't shoot people.

1179
01:23:17,148 --> 01:23:19,909
I sure as hell don't bend the rules
for my own convenience.

1180
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:23,450
Untie him, Belly.

1181
01:23:27,954 --> 01:23:29,587
I don't want him to kick me.

1182
01:23:29,589 --> 01:23:31,155
He won't.

1183
01:23:31,157 --> 01:23:32,422
He kicks, I shoot.

1184
01:23:33,090 --> 01:23:34,457
He knows that.

1185
01:23:34,459 --> 01:23:35,624
Don't you, Evan?

1186
01:23:40,162 --> 01:23:41,328
What do you want?

1187
01:23:42,463 --> 01:23:44,530
I wanna play hide and seek.

1188
01:23:46,132 --> 01:23:47,198
What?

1189
01:23:51,470 --> 01:23:53,636
Thirty seconds.
Only inside the house.

1190
01:23:53,638 --> 01:23:55,437
You leave the house, I shoot.

1191
01:23:57,039 --> 01:23:59,159
What're you gonna do
when you find me?

1192
01:24:00,341 --> 01:24:02,575
Well, if we don't
find you by sunrise,

1193
01:24:04,044 --> 01:24:05,044
we'll leave.

1194
01:24:06,345 --> 01:24:09,113
- Bullshit.
- Thirty seconds. Go! Go!

1195
01:24:09,115 --> 01:24:10,447
- Go!
- Go!

1196
01:24:12,616 --> 01:24:15,551
30, 29...

1197
01:24:15,553 --> 01:24:18,520
28, 27...

1198
01:24:18,522 --> 01:24:20,555
26, 25...

1199
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:25,259
24, 23, 22...

1200
01:24:30,564 --> 01:24:32,498
Go!

1201
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:34,632
Ready or not? Here we come!

1202
01:24:41,105 --> 01:24:43,206
Evan!

1203
01:24:44,374 --> 01:24:46,608
You can't hide from us.

1204
01:24:47,643 --> 01:24:48,643
Here we come.

1205
01:24:54,149 --> 01:24:55,482
Evan?

1206
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,587
We can smell you, Evan.

1207
01:25:07,159 --> 01:25:08,359
Daddy?

1208
01:25:08,361 --> 01:25:10,094
Psst! In here.

1209
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:19,335
- Evan?
- Oh, Evan?

1210
01:25:21,137 --> 01:25:22,604
Are you here, monster?

1211
01:25:28,177 --> 01:25:29,443
Evan?

1212
01:25:35,716 --> 01:25:36,782
Evan?

1213
01:25:38,151 --> 01:25:39,384
Shit!

1214
01:25:41,487 --> 01:25:43,120
Evan!

1215
01:25:46,491 --> 01:25:48,358
Yeah, there he goes!
Stop!

1216
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:49,492
Evan! Stop!

1217
01:25:51,361 --> 01:25:52,828
Oh, fuck!

1218
01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:55,197
Don't fucking move!

1219
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:57,232
Help me! Help me!

1220
01:25:57,234 --> 01:25:59,367
- Scream all you fucking want!
- Help me!

1221
01:25:59,369 --> 01:26:01,736
No one's fucking home!
We tried every house!

1222
01:26:56,388 --> 01:26:57,888
Are you ready!

1223
01:26:57,890 --> 01:27:00,457
Please don't do this!

1224
01:27:00,459 --> 01:27:02,192
- Time to say goodbye!
- Please! Please!

1225
01:27:03,127 --> 01:27:04,260
Help!

1226
01:27:05,161 --> 01:27:07,362
Help me!

1227
01:27:07,364 --> 01:27:08,629
Please, somebody help me!

1228
01:27:08,631 --> 01:27:09,763
Are you religious?

1229
01:27:09,765 --> 01:27:12,699
Help! Please somebody, help!

1230
01:27:13,767 --> 01:27:15,801
Please, let me go!

1231
01:27:15,803 --> 01:27:18,770
Help! Please help me!
Somebody help me!

1232
01:27:20,339 --> 01:27:22,473
No! Help me!

1233
01:27:22,475 --> 01:27:24,741
No! No! No! No! No!

1234
01:27:24,743 --> 01:27:27,143
No, help! Help!

1235
01:27:27,145 --> 01:27:29,311
One, two, three!

1236
01:27:31,213 --> 01:27:32,813
Whoopsie-daisy!

1237
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:37,851
So Evan, did we
hurt your shoulder?

1238
01:27:37,853 --> 01:27:40,486
We want you
to be comfy, Evan.

1239
01:27:52,565 --> 01:27:54,766
Help! Help!

1240
01:27:57,469 --> 01:27:59,770
Help! Help!

1241
01:28:01,539 --> 01:28:03,373
Don't move, Evan. You might
get dirt in your eyes.

1242
01:28:03,375 --> 01:28:04,941
Yeah, close your eyes, baby.

1243
01:28:04,943 --> 01:28:07,410
Help! Help!

1244
01:28:07,778 --> 01:28:09,411
Help!

1245
01:28:09,413 --> 01:28:12,747
Help! Help! Help!

1246
01:28:12,749 --> 01:28:15,816
Help! Help! Help!

1247
01:28:17,819 --> 01:28:20,587
Please. Please.

1248
01:28:20,589 --> 01:28:21,869
Please. Please, don't do this.

1249
01:28:22,923 --> 01:28:26,859
Please! Bel. Please.

1250
01:28:26,861 --> 01:28:28,941
It looks like he's trying
to communicate.

1251
01:28:29,028 --> 01:28:30,028
Please.

1252
01:28:33,698 --> 01:28:36,058
If you promise to behave,
I'll take out the gag.

1253
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Okay.

1254
01:28:49,478 --> 01:28:52,680
Don't do this. Please?

1255
01:28:52,682 --> 01:28:55,549
I'll do whatever you want.
I'll do whatever you want.

1256
01:28:55,551 --> 01:28:56,616
Whatever!

1257
01:28:59,453 --> 01:29:02,621
Even calling your family
and telling them everything you did to us?

1258
01:29:02,623 --> 01:29:03,989
Yes.

1259
01:29:03,991 --> 01:29:06,091
Yes. Yes. Yes. I'll tell them.

1260
01:29:06,093 --> 01:29:07,425
I'll tell them.

1261
01:29:09,094 --> 01:29:12,329
Okay, let's give him a lifeline.

1262
01:29:12,331 --> 01:29:15,498
I love the lifeline part.
Let's see.

1263
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:17,366
But the lifeline
is a phone call.

1264
01:29:17,368 --> 01:29:19,568
Not FaceTime.

1265
01:29:19,570 --> 01:29:22,003
Your wife's not gonna
see you like this.

1266
01:29:22,005 --> 01:29:24,338
<i>Hi, this is Karen Alvarado,</i>

1267
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:26,773
<i>please leave a message
or send a text. Ciao.</i>

1268
01:29:28,409 --> 01:29:29,841
Go ahead, talk.

1269
01:29:32,578 --> 01:29:35,713
Honey. I'm sorry for
what I'm gonna tell you.

1270
01:29:37,082 --> 01:29:38,415
They made me.

1271
01:29:39,450 --> 01:29:40,616
Fuck!

1272
01:29:41,684 --> 01:29:43,751
Call 911!

1273
01:29:43,753 --> 01:29:46,120
- Call 911! I've been kidnapped...
- Evan, Evan...

1274
01:29:46,122 --> 01:29:47,988
- ...by two girls!
- Evan!

1275
01:29:47,990 --> 01:29:49,656
Call 911!

1276
01:29:49,658 --> 01:29:51,524
- Call 911!
- No, no, no, Evan!

1277
01:29:51,526 --> 01:29:54,760
- You broke the rule.
- Evan, why did you do that?

1278
01:29:54,762 --> 01:29:56,628
Well, now she'll
fucking find you!

1279
01:29:56,630 --> 01:29:58,529
Not really.

1280
01:29:58,531 --> 01:30:01,451
I hung up as soon as it hit voice mail.
I knew you'd pussy out.

1281
01:30:04,936 --> 01:30:06,036
You fucking whores!

1282
01:30:08,039 --> 01:30:10,907
You fucking whores!

1283
01:30:10,909 --> 01:30:14,410
I'll fucking kill you,
you fucking-fuck bitch cunt!

1284
01:30:14,412 --> 01:30:16,545
I'll fucking kill you!
You fucking bitches!

1285
01:30:16,547 --> 01:30:19,714
Oh, there's Evan. There he is!

1286
01:30:19,716 --> 01:30:21,549
We missed you.

1287
01:30:21,551 --> 01:30:22,783
Fucking whores!

1288
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:27,520
Knock-knock!

1289
01:30:29,555 --> 01:30:32,056
I said knock-knock.

1290
01:30:32,058 --> 01:30:33,891
No!

1291
01:30:33,893 --> 01:30:35,592
I don't think he can talk.

1292
01:30:35,594 --> 01:30:36,993
Okay. Knock-knock.

1293
01:30:36,995 --> 01:30:38,394
Who's there?

1294
01:30:38,396 --> 01:30:40,929
- Cheating Evan.
- Cheating Evan who?

1295
01:30:40,931 --> 01:30:42,931
Cheating "Evan-tually"
gets you killed.

1296
01:30:43,131 --> 01:30:45,098
No! No!

1297
01:30:46,667 --> 01:30:48,868
- Ready, Evan?
- No!

1298
01:30:48,870 --> 01:30:50,669
No!

1299
01:30:50,671 --> 01:30:52,537
- One!
- No!

1300
01:30:52,539 --> 01:30:53,638
- Two.
- Do it!

1301
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:55,539
- No! No!
- Three!

1302
01:31:03,112 --> 01:31:04,812
Look at his face.

1303
01:31:09,550 --> 01:31:11,617
We got you good.

1304
01:31:11,619 --> 01:31:14,052
You didn't really think we
were gonna kill you, did you?

1305
01:31:14,054 --> 01:31:15,920
We're not animals.

1306
01:31:15,922 --> 01:31:17,922
It was just a game, Evan.

1307
01:31:17,924 --> 01:31:20,758
A game? A game?

1308
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:23,193
You know what?

1309
01:31:23,195 --> 01:31:27,130
For a moment, I thought
you were the one who'd say no.

1310
01:31:27,132 --> 01:31:29,999
And now we have to play
a game with someone else.

1311
01:31:31,534 --> 01:31:33,614
You know what's funny?
They never say no.

1312
01:31:35,003 --> 01:31:36,937
No matter who they are.

1313
01:31:36,939 --> 01:31:39,940
No matter how much
they love their families.

1314
01:31:39,942 --> 01:31:41,207
You're all the same.

1315
01:31:44,945 --> 01:31:45,945
Bye, Evan.

1316
01:31:48,748 --> 01:31:50,548
You were my favorite.

1317
01:31:52,450 --> 01:31:54,217
Oh!

1318
01:31:54,219 --> 01:31:56,485
Wish me happy birthday.
I turn 22 next week.

1319
01:31:56,487 --> 01:31:58,086
Yeah.

1320
01:31:58,088 --> 01:32:00,455
I freaked out
when I turned 18.

1321
01:32:00,457 --> 01:32:02,890
But you made me feel 15 again.
Thanks, Evan.

1322
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:06,126
Let's get out of here.

1323
01:32:06,128 --> 01:32:08,761
Oh, I almost forgot.
Yes, your phone.

1324
01:32:12,932 --> 01:32:15,600
You know you really should be
more careful with Facebook.

1325
01:32:15,602 --> 01:32:19,003
If you don't log out someone could do
terrible things with it.

1326
01:32:19,005 --> 01:32:22,005
Post something really personal
for all your friends to see.

1327
01:32:25,576 --> 01:32:28,077
Look closely.
So you'll remember us.

1328
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:31,580
<i>Yes, Evan, fuck her!</i>

1329
01:32:31,582 --> 01:32:32,681
<i>Fuck me, Daddy!</i>

1330
01:32:32,683 --> 01:32:33,715
<i>Okay.</i>

1331
01:32:35,150 --> 01:32:38,852
<i>Attaboy, Evan. Fuck her!</i>

1332
01:32:38,854 --> 01:32:41,688
<i>Fuck me! Fuck me!</i>

1333
01:32:41,690 --> 01:32:43,556
I'm sure you'll get a
lot of likes though.

1334
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:44,823
<i>Doggy style, Belly!</i>

1335
01:32:44,825 --> 01:32:46,257
Enjoy!

1336
01:32:47,725 --> 01:32:49,192
Oh!

1337
01:32:49,194 --> 01:32:52,528
Bye, Evan! Muah!
We'll miss you!

1338
01:32:56,165 --> 01:32:57,231
Oh!

1339
01:33:00,201 --> 01:33:01,968
No!

1340
01:33:03,871 --> 01:33:05,604
Oh, no!

1341
01:33:36,832 --> 01:33:39,300
<i>Fuck me, Daddy!</i>

1342
01:33:39,302 --> 01:33:41,302
God, God!

1343
01:35:21,634 --> 01:35:25,169
Take your bags to your rooms.
Then go use the bathroom.

1344
01:35:25,171 --> 01:35:28,238
And then we're gonna
go see Monkey, okay?

1345
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:29,772
- Are you guys tired?
- Yeah!

1346
01:35:29,774 --> 01:35:31,106
Monkey?

1347
01:35:32,208 --> 01:35:33,274
Monkey?

1348
01:35:49,891 --> 01:35:51,124
Daddy had a party.
