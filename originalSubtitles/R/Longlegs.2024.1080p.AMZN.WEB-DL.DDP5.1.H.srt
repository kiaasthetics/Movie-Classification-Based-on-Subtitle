1
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:35,998
Cuckoo!

2
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:23,045
There she is,

3
00:04:23,046 --> 00:04:27,397
the Almost Birthday Girl.

4
00:04:27,398 --> 00:04:30,269
Oh, but...

5
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,230
it seems I wore
my long legs today.

6
00:04:34,231 --> 00:04:36,493
What happens if I...?

7
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:50,333
♪ Well, I've got
a little babe ♪

8
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:52,857
♪ With jewels upon her lip

9
00:04:56,687 --> 00:04:57,949
♪ Well, I've got
a little babe ♪

10
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,560
♪ With jewels upon her lip

11
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:06,871
♪ Her hair's like a river

12
00:05:06,872 --> 00:05:09,352
♪ It's fast and slowly drips

13
00:05:09,353 --> 00:05:12,094
♪ How, how

14
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:14,444
♪ How, how

15
00:05:19,144 --> 00:05:20,558
♪ She bathes in thunder

16
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:21,973
♪ The elves are under her

17
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:28,305
♪ She bathes in thunder

18
00:05:28,306 --> 00:05:29,720
♪ The elves are under her

19
00:05:34,116 --> 00:05:35,682
♪ She walks the wind

20
00:05:35,683 --> 00:05:39,469
♪ And has a panther
with silver fur ♪

21
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,167
♪ How, how

22
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:43,778
♪ How, how

23
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:45,366
♪ Ow!

24
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,055
All right, kids.

25
00:06:01,056 --> 00:06:02,840
This is the part
where you get to do the things

26
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:05,843
the grownups
don't wanna do anymore.

27
00:06:05,844 --> 00:06:08,105
Door to door, on foot,

28
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:09,717
knock-knock,
"Have you seen this man?"

29
00:06:09,718 --> 00:06:11,327
Just like in the movies.

30
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:15,375
Partners have already
been assigned,

31
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:18,246
so no one gets hurt feelings.

32
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:22,338
Suspect likes to visit
a certain kind of neighborhood.

33
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:24,209
He's a middle-aged
Caucasian male

34
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,255
and not likely to go quietly,

35
00:06:27,256 --> 00:06:29,606
so let's always assume
he's armed.

36
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:33,393
We'll go alert and careful.

37
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:35,830
That's all.

38
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,927
Okay, well,

39
00:06:46,928 --> 00:06:49,191
I am good to be the one
who goes up and knocks,

40
00:06:49,192 --> 00:06:52,455
if you wanna be the one
who hangs back.

41
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:55,610
Harker?

42
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:57,285
You good?

43
00:06:57,286 --> 00:06:58,853
Yeah, I'm good.

44
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:06,137
That kid
smelled like narcotics.

45
00:08:06,138 --> 00:08:07,617
Harker.

46
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:11,925
It's that one.

47
00:08:11,926 --> 00:08:14,232
What's what one?

48
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:16,973
3525.

49
00:08:16,974 --> 00:08:18,585
He's in there.

50
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:21,413
What makes you say that?

51
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:25,547
I don't know.

52
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:27,289
We should call it in.

53
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,529
What? No.

54
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,641
No, we're not gonna
call in a hunch

55
00:08:31,642 --> 00:08:33,513
on our first day out doing this.

56
00:08:36,254 --> 00:08:38,343
Just relax.

57
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:44,524
But I'll go take a look.

58
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,025
All right?

59
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,527
Lee, relax.

60
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,104
FBI!

61
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:13,464
Hi there!

62
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:15,598
Hi, I just wondered if you'd
take a look at that for me...

63
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:15,876
Don't move.

64
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,182
I won't.

65
00:10:35,373 --> 00:10:37,549
<i>State your name and rank.</i>

66
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:42,816
Special Agent Lee Harker.

67
00:10:44,295 --> 00:10:46,601
Can someone tell me
what I'm doing in here?

68
00:10:46,602 --> 00:10:48,343
<i>Special Agent Lee Harker,</i>

69
00:10:48,344 --> 00:10:49,779
<i>are you ready to begin?</i>

70
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:53,087
Ready to begin what?

71
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:56,568
<i>State the first word
that comes to mind</i>

72
00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:58,353
<i>to accompany each image.</i>

73
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,312
<i>Are you ready to begin?</i>

74
00:11:01,313 --> 00:11:03,227
Yes.

75
00:11:06,187 --> 00:11:07,448
Camera.

76
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:08,689
Table.

77
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,114
Legs.

78
00:11:10,115 --> 00:11:11,540
Tiger.

79
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:17,284
Door.

80
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:18,568
Mother.

81
00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:20,037
Father.

82
00:11:20,038 --> 00:11:21,505
Piano.

83
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:23,290
<i>A number has been generated</i>

84
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,813
<i>between zero and 100,</i>

85
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:26,336
<i>inclusive.</i>

86
00:11:26,337 --> 00:11:28,557
<i>What is the number?</i>

87
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,909
I-I don't know.

88
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,215
33?

89
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:38,697
<i>A number has been generated</i>

90
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,570
<i>between zero and 100,
inclusive.</i>

91
00:11:41,571 --> 00:11:43,398
<i>What is the number?</i>

92
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:47,489
Zero.

93
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:56,280
You a baseball fan, Harker?

94
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:58,543
No, sir.

95
00:11:58,544 --> 00:12:00,154
Damn.

96
00:12:01,198 --> 00:12:05,333
I need to talk to someone
about my beautiful Mariners,

97
00:12:05,334 --> 00:12:07,508
but...

98
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:10,425
Well, my wife's getting
pretty good at faking it, so...

99
00:12:10,426 --> 00:12:12,122
That's a slippery slope.

100
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:15,646
Damn, Agent Browning,
that's cold.

101
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:17,693
I only work with
what you give me, Agent Carter.

102
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:23,438
You beat that
numbers generator eight times.

103
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:24,786
How'd you do that?

104
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:26,571
I also missed it eight times.

105
00:12:26,572 --> 00:12:27,964
Hmm.

106
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:32,708
Half-psychic is better
than not psychic at all,

107
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:34,188
I'd say.

108
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:41,195
Family of four
lived in that house

109
00:12:41,196 --> 00:12:42,326
for 12 years.

110
00:12:42,327 --> 00:12:43,675
The Horns.

111
00:12:43,676 --> 00:12:45,024
Nice people.

112
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:47,767
Dad taught college,
coached T-ball.

113
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:50,051
Mom ran the church bake sale,

114
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:52,107
and then, two months ago,

115
00:12:52,108 --> 00:12:53,788
they all get murdered inside.

116
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:55,469
Four victims,

117
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,190
but technically three murders
and a suicide.

118
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,821
The father?

119
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:01,998
Yeah, he didn't do it
halfway, either.

120
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:04,304
Stabbed his wife 61 times

121
00:13:04,305 --> 00:13:06,481
before the blade
snapped off the handle.

122
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:11,312
What about the kids?

123
00:13:11,313 --> 00:13:12,987
What about 'em?

124
00:13:12,988 --> 00:13:14,663
How many wounds?

125
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,276
You can read about it
in the file.

126
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,759
You said four were murdered.

127
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,846
I don't understand.

128
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:26,152
Neither do we.

129
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:28,851
A letter was left
with the bodies,

130
00:13:28,852 --> 00:13:30,287
written in a coded alphabet,

131
00:13:30,288 --> 00:13:31,722
and not in the hand of anyone

132
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:33,769
in any way
connected to the family.

133
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,161
So...

134
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:37,642
We have ten letters like it,

135
00:13:37,643 --> 00:13:38,991
made by the same hand.

136
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:44,040
Ten houses, ten families,
over the past 30 years,

137
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:47,304
and all of them signed
with one word...

138
00:13:47,305 --> 00:13:49,349
"Longlegs".

139
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,092
Someone or something
is making the fathers do it.

140
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:56,923
So far, we've been goddamned
to figure out what or who.

141
00:14:01,492 --> 00:14:03,572
I'm telling you,
she's not ready for this.

142
00:14:05,322 --> 00:14:06,715
You got a better idea,
Browning,

143
00:14:06,716 --> 00:14:09,196
then you can run with it.

144
00:14:15,637 --> 00:14:17,551
There you go, Harker,

145
00:14:17,552 --> 00:14:19,467
take a nice long look.

146
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:25,864
Tell me your version

147
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,345
of what happened in Colfax
with the shooting of Agent Fisk.

148
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:32,958
It's hard to explain, sir.

149
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,265
It's like something
tapping me on the shoulder,

150
00:14:35,266 --> 00:14:36,658
telling me where to look.

151
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:40,488
You identified
a suspect's house,

152
00:14:40,489 --> 00:14:41,880
with no prior knowledge,

153
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,926
no real indication
that it was any way different

154
00:14:43,927 --> 00:14:46,298
than all the cookie-cutters
all around it.

155
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:48,670
Anything like that
ever happen to you before,

156
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:50,932
Agent Harker?

157
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:53,326
From time to time, sir.

158
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:58,419
Well, maybe we'll just
call you "highly intuitive".

159
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,987
Yes, sir.

160
00:15:00,988 --> 00:15:02,379
Uh-huh.

161
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,826
Tell me what you see.

162
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:17,655
What do the families
have in common?

163
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,332
That's a good question.

164
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,225
All the victim families

165
00:15:23,226 --> 00:15:25,576
have daughters
whose birthdays are on the 14th

166
00:15:25,577 --> 00:15:27,187
of any given month.

167
00:15:30,103 --> 00:15:31,886
But only the Horns

168
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:33,802
were actually murdered
on that date.

169
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,025
Get to work.

170
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:02,178
<i>9-1-1.
What's your emergency?</i>

171
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:06,007
<i>It's...</i>

172
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:07,749
<i>It's my daughter.</i>

173
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:13,014
<i>It's...
it's not my daughter...</i>

174
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:15,713
<i>Sir, who's not your daughter?</i>

175
00:16:15,714 --> 00:16:17,237
<i>I gotta be quiet.</i>

176
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,717
<i>I've gotta be quiet.</i>

177
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:22,118
<i>Sir, where are you?</i>

178
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:24,635
<i>When she's sleeping...</i>

179
00:16:25,723 --> 00:16:26,985
<i>When she's sleeping,</i>

180
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,813
<i>it's the best time to do it.</i>

181
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:31,076
<i>Do what?</i>

182
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:33,687
<i>When her eyes are closed.</i>

183
00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:35,907
<i>Sir, can you
stay on the line with me?</i>

184
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:42,262
<i>Sir?</i>

185
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:45,394
<i>Hello?</i>

186
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:47,396
<i>Can you stay on the line?</i>

187
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:49,399
<i>Sir?</i>

188
00:16:55,797 --> 00:16:57,929
<i>9-1-1. What is your emergency?</i>

189
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:06,937
<i>Help!</i>

190
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:34,053
Harker!

191
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:42,278
You know, there's such a thing
as looking too long.

192
00:17:46,587 --> 00:17:48,328
I must have lost track of time.

193
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:53,136
I'm still thirsty.

194
00:17:53,137 --> 00:17:54,985
Are you thirsty?

195
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:57,009
Come on, let's go for a drink.

196
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,696
You'll have to excuse me, I...

197
00:17:58,697 --> 00:18:00,236
it's late, and I don't drink.

198
00:18:00,237 --> 00:18:01,776
You don't drink, you're right.

199
00:18:01,777 --> 00:18:03,211
I'll drink

200
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:05,345
while you tell me things.

201
00:18:05,346 --> 00:18:07,694
Agent Harker.

202
00:18:07,695 --> 00:18:09,697
Come on, bag it up!

203
00:18:15,398 --> 00:18:17,748
Ah, thanks, Melissa.

204
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:21,578
Go ahead, Harker.

205
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:27,584
Well, there's no signs
of forced entry.

206
00:18:27,585 --> 00:18:29,107
In fact, forensics says

207
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,720
there's no indication
he was ever in the house at all.

208
00:18:32,721 --> 00:18:34,417
There's only the bodies
of the victims,

209
00:18:34,418 --> 00:18:35,548
and they've all been killed

210
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:37,420
with something
from inside the house.

211
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:39,595
Two times, a shotgun,

212
00:18:39,596 --> 00:18:42,163
both legally registered
to the father.

213
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:44,732
Eight times, a knife
from the family's kitchen.

214
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:46,864
Once, a hammer
from the family's toolbox.

215
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:49,149
All right.

216
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,302
And...?

217
00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:52,652
Longlegs would have to be
inside the house

218
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:55,003
to use the shotgun,
the knife, the hammer,

219
00:18:55,004 --> 00:18:56,744
but according
to physical evidence,

220
00:18:56,745 --> 00:18:59,137
he never is.

221
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,879
If it wasn't for the letters
he left behind,

222
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,621
it's almost like
he was never there at all.

223
00:19:04,622 --> 00:19:06,623
He murders them,

224
00:19:06,624 --> 00:19:08,625
but not in person.

225
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,155
Maybe he tells the families
what he wants them to do...

226
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,940
to themselves, to each other...

227
00:19:18,941 --> 00:19:20,333
then they do it.

228
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,551
Well, now, that...

229
00:19:22,552 --> 00:19:24,989
that reads
like a page out of Manson.

230
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:31,866
Manson had accomplices.

231
00:19:31,867 --> 00:19:33,823
His Family.

232
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:36,305
You think Longlegs has help?

233
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:39,700
Hmm.

234
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:42,616
All right.

235
00:19:43,747 --> 00:19:45,008
Mm!

236
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:46,880
Oh, man.

237
00:19:48,753 --> 00:19:50,101
Whoo!

238
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:54,214
Okay, bedtime.

239
00:19:54,215 --> 00:19:56,630
I'll drive.

240
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:05,247
You take a left right here.

241
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,557
And the lights are on.

242
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:11,906
I'm busted.

243
00:20:14,996 --> 00:20:18,172
Well, all right, Harker,

244
00:20:18,173 --> 00:20:20,088
you get to come meet
my wife and kid.

245
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:22,046
Um, sir...

246
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:24,005
do I have to?

247
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:25,354
Yeah.

248
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:37,627
Come on in.

249
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:41,849
Hey, there she is!

250
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:45,418
You didn't call
to say goodnight.

251
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:46,940
Oh, 'cause it was late,

252
00:20:46,941 --> 00:20:48,681
and it was past your bedtime.

253
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:50,292
Well, now it's even later,

254
00:20:50,293 --> 00:20:52,729
and way, way past my bedtime.

255
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:53,947
Uh, yeah.

256
00:20:53,948 --> 00:20:56,646
I guess I screwed that up, huh?

257
00:20:56,647 --> 00:20:57,995
Hello.

258
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,085
Oh, hey,
this is, uh, Agent Lee Harker.

259
00:21:01,086 --> 00:21:03,436
Harker, this is
my beautiful wife, Anna,

260
00:21:03,437 --> 00:21:05,829
and our daughter, Miss Ruby.

261
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,223
Nice to meet you, Harker.

262
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,877
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, babe.

263
00:21:10,878 --> 00:21:12,749
I'm glad you're home.

264
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,621
Do you want to see my room?

265
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:34,641
What happened to this one?

266
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:37,207
Its head got cut off,

267
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:39,210
and I don't know where it is.

268
00:21:41,952 --> 00:21:44,999
I guess that's more my job...

269
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,218
finding things, I mean.

270
00:21:53,224 --> 00:21:56,053
What about that thing,
do you go in it?

271
00:21:56,054 --> 00:21:58,185
It's too babyish.

272
00:21:58,186 --> 00:22:00,362
Dad says he wants to keep
some of my old stuff around

273
00:22:00,363 --> 00:22:02,168
so I don't grow up too fast,

274
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:03,680
but I'm gonna grow up anyway.

275
00:22:03,681 --> 00:22:05,241
Even veals grow a little,

276
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:06,802
and they live in a box

277
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:09,153
with their legs all tied up
and everything.

278
00:22:11,547 --> 00:22:13,897
Veals have it pretty tough,
don't they?

279
00:22:17,118 --> 00:22:20,034
Did you wanna be an FBI agent
when you were a little girl?

280
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:25,038
No.

281
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,911
I actually
wanted to be an actress.

282
00:22:27,912 --> 00:22:30,566
That messes up kids.

283
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:33,264
So they say.

284
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:39,880
Is it scary
being a lady FBI agent?

285
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,971
Yeah.

286
00:22:44,972 --> 00:22:47,060
Yeah, it is.

287
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:48,475
All right, you two.

288
00:22:48,476 --> 00:22:49,889
I'm sure Agent Harker's got

289
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,414
a lot of very important
work to do,

290
00:22:52,415 --> 00:22:55,591
and, Miss Ruby Carter, it's...

291
00:22:55,592 --> 00:22:57,853
Well, it's tomorrow.

292
00:22:57,854 --> 00:23:00,379
Can she come
to my birthday party?

293
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:04,382
Sounds great to me.

294
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,514
Why don't you ask her?

295
00:23:11,346 --> 00:23:13,174
I'll be there.

296
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,202
<i>Yes?</i>

297
00:24:47,203 --> 00:24:48,627
<i>Hello?</i>

298
00:24:48,628 --> 00:24:50,053
Hi, Mom.

299
00:24:52,578 --> 00:24:54,143
<i>Lee?</i>

300
00:24:54,144 --> 00:24:56,756
Yup, still only me.

301
00:24:56,757 --> 00:24:58,800
Are you okay?

302
00:24:58,801 --> 00:25:00,976
<i>Yeah, spent the day at home.</i>

303
00:25:00,977 --> 00:25:03,153
<i>Where else would I be?</i>

304
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:08,375
What are you doing
in the house?

305
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:10,160
Do you have to let the phone
ring so long?

306
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:14,382
<i>Trying to go through
some stuff over here.</i>

307
00:25:14,383 --> 00:25:16,188
<i>Are you okay?</i>

308
00:25:16,189 --> 00:25:17,994
Yeah, I'm okay.

309
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,388
I just can't sleep.

310
00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:23,739
A lot on my mind.

311
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,524
Work stuff.

312
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,048
<i>Nasty stuff?</i>

313
00:25:34,445 --> 00:25:37,665
Um, yeah.

314
00:25:39,668 --> 00:25:43,106
<i>Want to tell me about it?</i>

315
00:25:43,107 --> 00:25:44,390
No...

316
00:25:44,391 --> 00:25:45,674
No.

317
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:52,288
<i>Don't forget
I was a nurse for eight years.</i>

318
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:56,555
<i>I saw more than my
fair share of nasty stuff.</i>

319
00:25:58,034 --> 00:26:00,471
I think I just need to be quiet
for a little bit.

320
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,173
<i>Somebody's birthday's
coming up.</i>

321
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:18,577
<i>Honey? Are you still there?</i>

322
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:22,710
Mom, I gotta go.

323
00:26:22,711 --> 00:26:24,757
I-I'll call you back, okay?

324
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:03,056
Hello?

325
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:46,539
<i>Hello,</i>

326
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,715
<i>no one is available
to take your call.</i>

327
00:30:48,716 --> 00:30:50,936
<i>Please leave a message
after the tone.</i>

328
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,830
<i>Lee?</i>

329
00:30:54,831 --> 00:30:56,941
<i>Are you there?</i>

330
00:30:56,942 --> 00:30:58,813
<i>Call me back.</i>

331
00:31:22,097 --> 00:31:23,793
Yes, Mom, I'm fine.

332
00:31:23,794 --> 00:31:26,058
<i>Harker?
Carter's looking for you.</i>

333
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:28,147
Um, yeah, I'll be right in.

334
00:31:41,595 --> 00:31:43,771
Can you have a look at this?

335
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:11,799
Him again.

336
00:32:14,062 --> 00:32:16,368
We are real late on this one.

337
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:18,675
Looks like the family
was planning a trip.

338
00:32:18,676 --> 00:32:20,067
A friend assumed they'd gone,

339
00:32:20,068 --> 00:32:22,417
so no one bothered
to check in on 'em.

340
00:32:22,418 --> 00:32:24,811
Found plane tickets
for Los Angeles

341
00:32:24,812 --> 00:32:27,206
and reservations for Disneyland.

342
00:32:27,207 --> 00:32:29,077
Sounds like a nice idea.

343
00:32:30,296 --> 00:32:32,689
And the girl's birthday
was the 14th?

344
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,822
Seems like it.

345
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:45,223
How'd you figure that out?

346
00:32:45,224 --> 00:32:47,313
I only looked
long enough, sir.

347
00:32:49,532 --> 00:32:51,751
Yeah, well,

348
00:32:51,752 --> 00:32:54,320
there's a dead family
in the master bedroom,

349
00:32:54,321 --> 00:32:57,323
so let's go
take a long look at that.

350
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:05,679
We found dad in the garage.

351
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,853
Wrists and throat,

352
00:33:06,854 --> 00:33:09,247
kitchen knife in his hand.

353
00:33:09,248 --> 00:33:10,618
His wounds look self-inflicted,

354
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:11,990
but we'll be sure
when we're sure.

355
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:17,778
This is everyone else here,

356
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:20,128
and it's not great.

357
00:33:20,129 --> 00:33:21,520
How long ago?

358
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:22,826
I'd say about a month.

359
00:33:22,827 --> 00:33:23,958
Jesus.

360
00:33:25,612 --> 00:33:26,612
Okay.

361
00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:28,266
Let's take a look.

362
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:29,919
Are you sure she...

363
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,966
Yeah, she's good. You're good,
aren't you, Harker?

364
00:33:33,489 --> 00:33:35,187
Pull it.

365
00:33:44,848 --> 00:33:46,633
How old's the girl?

366
00:33:47,895 --> 00:33:50,593
I'm guessing nine or ten.

367
00:33:51,681 --> 00:33:53,031
Fuck.

368
00:34:10,613 --> 00:34:12,311
<i>Yes, who is it?</i>

369
00:34:12,312 --> 00:34:13,834
Hi, Mom.

370
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:16,792
<i>Lee?</i>

371
00:34:16,793 --> 00:34:18,707
Yes.

372
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:20,623
Still your only daughter.

373
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,764
Anyways, I was calling
to let you know

374
00:34:30,765 --> 00:34:32,461
that I'm gonna busy now,

375
00:34:32,462 --> 00:34:33,853
with work,

376
00:34:33,854 --> 00:34:36,770
and I probably
won't be able to make it.

377
00:34:36,771 --> 00:34:38,554
I want to, it's just...

378
00:34:43,603 --> 00:34:45,213
Mom, are you still there?

379
00:34:46,736 --> 00:34:49,130
<i>Be careful
they don't work you too hard,</i>

380
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:50,261
<i>all right?</i>

381
00:34:50,262 --> 00:34:52,394
Yeah, but it's good.

382
00:34:52,395 --> 00:34:54,526
It's really good.

383
00:34:54,527 --> 00:34:56,529
They put me on
something important.

384
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,703
<i>Yeah?</i>

385
00:34:57,704 --> 00:34:59,835
<i>What is it?</i>

386
00:34:59,836 --> 00:35:02,055
Well, I can't tell you.

387
00:35:02,056 --> 00:35:03,710
You wouldn't
wanna hear about it anyways.

388
00:35:03,711 --> 00:35:06,146
<i>Not nice things.</i>

389
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:09,846
I don't think the Bureau
has a division for nice things.

390
00:35:11,413 --> 00:35:14,895
<i>Will I see you
on your birthday next week?</i>

391
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:20,095
I'll try.

392
00:35:20,096 --> 00:35:21,857
<i>Lee?</i>

393
00:35:21,858 --> 00:35:24,426
<i>Are you still saying
your prayers?</i>

394
00:35:24,427 --> 00:35:25,383
Yeah.

395
00:35:25,384 --> 00:35:26,732
Listen I gotta go.

396
00:35:26,733 --> 00:35:28,081
<i>Lee, honey,</i>

397
00:35:28,082 --> 00:35:31,390
<i>our prayers protect us
from the Devil.</i>

398
00:35:31,391 --> 00:35:33,217
I know.

399
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:36,002
I know, Mom.

400
00:35:36,003 --> 00:35:38,092
I'll call you later, okay?

401
00:37:38,604 --> 00:37:39,866
Help me out here.

402
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:44,262
It's an algorithm.

403
00:37:45,741 --> 00:37:48,570
His algorithm.

404
00:37:49,919 --> 00:37:52,095
Help me out more.

405
00:37:54,141 --> 00:37:57,622
The first murder happens
on July 14th, 1966.

406
00:37:57,623 --> 00:38:00,582
The rest occur within six days
of the daughters' birthdays,

407
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:01,975
either before or after...

408
00:38:04,543 --> 00:38:06,849
...creating
an inverted triangle.

409
00:38:10,113 --> 00:38:12,202
Okay, what am I
supposed to do with this?

410
00:38:12,203 --> 00:38:13,769
I also decoded
all his letters.

411
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,292
The one thing that stood out

412
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,815
was the repeated reference

413
00:38:16,816 --> 00:38:19,514
to "the fine time we had
at the Camera family farm,"

414
00:38:19,515 --> 00:38:21,951
where X's mark the spot.

415
00:38:23,997 --> 00:38:25,346
The Camera family.

416
00:38:26,434 --> 00:38:28,762
I was at Georgetown
when that happened.

417
00:38:28,763 --> 00:38:31,091
Their local priest
makes his weekly visit,

418
00:38:31,092 --> 00:38:32,700
but it goes bad,

419
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:35,574
due to Carrie Anne's father
and the axe from the toolshed.

420
00:38:35,575 --> 00:38:38,316
He kills the priest, his wife,
and then himself.

421
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:40,535
Carrie Anne's at school,
so she survives.

422
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,017
Look at the date.

423
00:38:44,018 --> 00:38:45,322
March 8th.

424
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,890
Now look at
Carrie Anne's birthday.

425
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:52,894
March 14th.

426
00:38:52,895 --> 00:38:54,918
Six days apart.

427
00:38:54,919 --> 00:38:56,942
Well, no shit.

428
00:38:56,943 --> 00:39:00,686
I believe Longlegs was
at the Camera family farm,

429
00:39:00,687 --> 00:39:03,776
and it's possible
that Carrie Anne saw him.

430
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:07,954
What about the 13th?

431
00:39:07,955 --> 00:39:09,911
It's missing.

432
00:39:09,912 --> 00:39:12,196
I'm still not sure about that,

433
00:39:12,197 --> 00:39:14,623
but it's three days from now.

434
00:39:14,624 --> 00:39:17,049
Maybe Longlegs will kill again.

435
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:19,182
And this Carrie Anne,
she still alive?

436
00:39:19,183 --> 00:39:21,576
Water Rock
Psychiatric Hospital.

437
00:39:21,577 --> 00:39:22,708
That's not far from here.

438
00:39:22,709 --> 00:39:23,817
132 miles, sir.

439
00:39:23,818 --> 00:39:24,927
And the old farm?

440
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,885
89.

441
00:39:26,886 --> 00:39:28,061
Let's start there.

442
00:40:17,197 --> 00:40:18,720
It's over there.

443
00:40:55,801 --> 00:40:57,759
Xs mark the spot.

444
00:42:21,843 --> 00:42:23,387
Carter?

445
00:42:23,388 --> 00:42:24,933
Yeah?

446
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:29,449
She's handmade,
that's for sure.

447
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:31,560
and beautifully handmade
at that.

448
00:44:31,561 --> 00:44:33,671
Porcelain head, hands and feet,

449
00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:35,194
unbleached canvas body,

450
00:44:35,195 --> 00:44:36,934
cotton stuffing.

451
00:44:36,935 --> 00:44:39,719
The hair is human,
what's left of it.

452
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,505
All in all,
it's beautifully made,

453
00:44:42,506 --> 00:44:44,506
by a highly-skilled craftsman.

454
00:44:44,507 --> 00:44:45,813
But what about the ball there?

455
00:44:45,814 --> 00:44:47,031
Mm.

456
00:44:47,032 --> 00:44:48,641
It was inside the head.

457
00:44:48,642 --> 00:44:51,492
So I've been calling it
the "brain".

458
00:44:51,493 --> 00:44:54,343
It's hollow,
empty of object or matter,

459
00:44:54,344 --> 00:44:55,562
but listen...

460
00:45:28,073 --> 00:45:31,990
And what's your name,
little angel?

461
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,518
Nice to meet you, Carrie Anne.

462
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:40,040
Now...

463
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:42,565
I know you're not afraid

464
00:45:42,566 --> 00:45:45,090
of a little bit of dark...

465
00:45:46,395 --> 00:45:50,095
...because you are the dark.

466
00:46:02,716 --> 00:46:04,326
The other night,
I could have sworn

467
00:46:04,327 --> 00:46:05,937
it was whispering
my ex-wife's name

468
00:46:05,938 --> 00:46:07,590
over and over again,

469
00:46:07,591 --> 00:46:08,982
but...

470
00:46:08,983 --> 00:46:10,375
I've been working very late,

471
00:46:10,376 --> 00:46:11,769
and of course it... it wasn't.

472
00:46:13,074 --> 00:46:15,947
Yeah, can the...
Can the "brain" be opened up?

473
00:46:15,948 --> 00:46:17,382
Of course,

474
00:46:17,383 --> 00:46:18,600
but it's not likely

475
00:46:18,601 --> 00:46:20,342
there's a solution
to your case in there,

476
00:46:20,343 --> 00:46:22,475
because
there's nothing in there.

477
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,695
Well,

478
00:46:26,696 --> 00:46:29,482
let's go see Carrie Anne Camera
at the mental hospital.

479
00:47:41,684 --> 00:47:43,425
Can I help you
with anything else today?

480
00:47:48,517 --> 00:47:50,170
Cuckoo.

481
00:47:50,171 --> 00:47:52,913
Cuckoo. Cuckoo.

482
00:47:52,914 --> 00:47:54,567
Cuckoo.

483
00:47:56,134 --> 00:47:58,658
I don't know what that
was supposed to be.

484
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:05,186
And what day is your birthday,
little angel?

485
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:09,407
Daddy!

486
00:48:09,408 --> 00:48:12,498
That gross guy is back again!

487
00:48:23,988 --> 00:48:27,251
Daddy!

488
00:48:27,252 --> 00:48:29,907
Mommy!

489
00:48:29,908 --> 00:48:32,387
Unmake me!

490
00:48:32,388 --> 00:48:34,867
And save me

491
00:48:34,868 --> 00:48:37,979
from the hell of living!

492
00:48:42,745 --> 00:48:46,793
Two days ago, Carrie Anne
is postcard catatonic.

493
00:48:46,794 --> 00:48:48,664
Well, slumped in a chair
by the door

494
00:48:48,665 --> 00:48:50,622
for as long as I've been here,

495
00:48:50,623 --> 00:48:52,580
and I've been here eight years.

496
00:48:52,581 --> 00:48:55,061
Then yesterday,
she gets a visitor,

497
00:48:55,062 --> 00:48:57,543
and I've never seen
that happen either,

498
00:48:57,544 --> 00:49:00,633
and like someone
flipped a switch

499
00:49:00,634 --> 00:49:02,025
on the back of her head,

500
00:49:02,026 --> 00:49:05,812
and all of a sudden,
she's right there.

501
00:49:05,813 --> 00:49:07,248
Wide awake,

502
00:49:07,249 --> 00:49:08,683
eyes bright.

503
00:49:08,684 --> 00:49:10,207
You saw this visitor?

504
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:13,994
No, I wasn't on site
at the time, unfortunately,

505
00:49:13,995 --> 00:49:15,778
but the log should say.

506
00:49:28,008 --> 00:49:29,575
Does the guard check IDs?

507
00:49:31,533 --> 00:49:36,103
Well, it does sound like
a good idea, but no.

508
00:49:36,104 --> 00:49:38,410
No, we do not require that.

509
00:49:47,027 --> 00:49:48,680
Thank you, Carrie Anne,

510
00:49:48,681 --> 00:49:50,857
for taking the time
to talk to me today.

511
00:49:54,469 --> 00:49:56,732
I've seen you before,

512
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,257
ain't I?

513
00:50:01,259 --> 00:50:02,912
I don't think so.

514
00:50:06,133 --> 00:50:09,092
You...

515
00:50:09,093 --> 00:50:11,399
been to my house...

516
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:19,190
...or someone s'looks s'lots
like you, anyways.

517
00:50:22,454 --> 00:50:24,760
How are you feeling today,
Carrie Anne?

518
00:50:27,111 --> 00:50:28,808
Mm...

519
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:32,159
...different.

520
00:50:34,074 --> 00:50:37,076
It's like...

521
00:50:37,077 --> 00:50:40,080
a long dream...

522
00:50:42,169 --> 00:50:44,888
...and so dark.

523
00:50:44,889 --> 00:50:47,609
A world of dark.

524
00:50:50,482 --> 00:50:53,919
Like a nowhere

525
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,401
'tween here and there.

526
00:50:58,229 --> 00:50:59,969
What's that called?

527
00:51:02,711 --> 00:51:04,800
Doin' the limbo?

528
00:51:06,585 --> 00:51:08,847
And before...

529
00:51:08,848 --> 00:51:11,110
the long dream,

530
00:51:11,111 --> 00:51:13,352
do you remember anything?

531
00:51:13,353 --> 00:51:15,594
Do you remember coming here?

532
00:51:17,161 --> 00:51:19,598
Do you remember your parents?

533
00:51:32,176 --> 00:51:36,180
They didn't a'know
what to do with themselves.

534
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,532
I mean...

535
00:51:41,533 --> 00:51:44,753
gosh, and I knew
I was a handful as it were's.

536
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:51,977
Momma always hated me,

537
00:51:51,978 --> 00:51:55,329
'cause how I'd come out wrongly
when I was borned.

538
00:51:59,203 --> 00:52:00,726
Bled her up too much.

539
00:52:20,833 --> 00:52:22,878
Poppa was a good man.

540
00:52:25,403 --> 00:52:28,101
That's the somethin'
I remember good.

541
00:52:34,063 --> 00:52:36,414
That's why he done it.

542
00:53:25,767 --> 00:53:28,205
You had a visitor yesterday.

543
00:53:31,512 --> 00:53:33,253
Can you describe him for me?

544
00:53:36,082 --> 00:53:38,954
Gosh, I don't ever
wanna forget 'im.

545
00:53:40,434 --> 00:53:43,350
I was jus' waitin' on him
to come and get me.

546
00:53:44,786 --> 00:53:48,225
To come and tells me
somethin's to do for 'im.

547
00:53:48,226 --> 00:53:50,791
Or even better,

548
00:53:50,792 --> 00:53:55,318
to do somethin' for
the Man Down The Stairs,

549
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:59,366
and, boy, I just wanna do
whatsever-so he says me to do.

550
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:02,891
Like, if'n he told me
to take a jumpy out a window,

551
00:54:02,892 --> 00:54:05,763
I'd surely do.

552
00:54:05,764 --> 00:54:07,112
Just happy as peaches

553
00:54:07,113 --> 00:54:10,421
to watch the ground
as it come up to meet me.

554
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,729
Or if'n he told me

555
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:17,732
to kill you right-right here
in this room with my bare hand,

556
00:54:17,733 --> 00:54:19,256
I'd surely do.

557
00:54:22,302 --> 00:54:23,911
Just happy as peaches

558
00:54:23,912 --> 00:54:26,849
to watch your heavy heart
go pop-pop,

559
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:29,788
and your eyeses
to go all to blood.

560
00:54:36,664 --> 00:54:39,667
Do you remember having a doll?

561
00:54:40,842 --> 00:54:43,715
A special doll
that looked just like you?

562
00:54:43,716 --> 00:54:45,586
Nope.

563
00:54:48,154 --> 00:54:51,809
And you don't remember neither,

564
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:55,466
you dirtsy, flirtsy
ol' angel bitch.

565
00:55:38,987 --> 00:55:40,074
A'ight, a'ight,

566
00:55:40,075 --> 00:55:43,382
so he murders a family in '75,

567
00:55:43,383 --> 00:55:44,645
but he probably isn't even
in the house

568
00:55:44,646 --> 00:55:46,080
when they're killed.

569
00:55:46,081 --> 00:55:48,083
Then comes back
almost 20 years later

570
00:55:48,084 --> 00:55:49,954
to visit the only survivor,

571
00:55:49,955 --> 00:55:51,564
signs in
as the agent chasing him,

572
00:55:51,565 --> 00:55:53,654
and then leaves
his only surviving victim

573
00:55:53,655 --> 00:55:55,678
feeling much, much better

574
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:57,702
than before he got there.

575
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:00,356
Mm.

576
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:03,838
She came out of her catatonia
the same day we found the doll.

577
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,927
Yeah, that couldn't be
anything but a coincidence.

578
00:56:06,841 --> 00:56:09,104
Look, we opened the ball
in the doll's head,

579
00:56:09,105 --> 00:56:10,714
and there's nothing inside.

580
00:56:10,715 --> 00:56:12,325
Maybe we're missing something.

581
00:56:13,718 --> 00:56:15,545
Something that...

582
00:56:15,546 --> 00:56:18,417
I don't know, makes it work.

583
00:56:18,418 --> 00:56:20,986
In some cultures,
dolls are used in magic,

584
00:56:20,987 --> 00:56:22,900
to control people.

585
00:56:22,901 --> 00:56:25,860
So, he kills them with a doll
from somewhere else

586
00:56:25,861 --> 00:56:27,993
by what, remote control?

587
00:56:29,168 --> 00:56:32,345
Longlegs is just a man, Harker,
not a witch doctor.

588
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:37,263
Sit down.

589
00:56:44,226 --> 00:56:48,230
How does Longlegs
know your name, Harker?

590
00:56:49,188 --> 00:56:50,863
I don't know, sir.

591
00:56:50,864 --> 00:56:52,538
You know, last week,

592
00:56:52,539 --> 00:56:55,281
this investigation is ice-cold.

593
00:56:55,282 --> 00:56:56,629
Then you come on to it,

594
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:59,633
and all of a sudden,
it's flowing like...

595
00:56:59,634 --> 00:57:02,506
I don't know, hot lava.

596
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:05,813
What aren't you telling me?

597
00:57:13,734 --> 00:57:17,041
I revisited your file.

598
00:57:17,042 --> 00:57:19,610
When was the last time
you talked to your mother?

599
00:57:26,007 --> 00:57:27,312
Sorry, sir,

600
00:57:27,313 --> 00:57:30,142
but what does that
have to do with the case?

601
00:57:31,709 --> 00:57:33,711
She called in a police report,

602
00:57:33,712 --> 00:57:36,495
January 13, 1974.

603
00:57:36,496 --> 00:57:38,716
That's one day
before your 9th birthday.

604
00:57:38,717 --> 00:57:40,935
That makes your birthday

605
00:57:40,936 --> 00:57:42,589
the 14th.

606
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,853
She did?

607
00:57:46,854 --> 00:57:48,507
She did.

608
00:57:48,508 --> 00:57:50,815
Gave a description
of a trespasser.

609
00:57:50,816 --> 00:57:53,774
Tall and pale.

610
00:57:53,775 --> 00:57:55,798
Harker...

611
00:57:55,799 --> 00:57:57,822
look at me.

612
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:06,178
Do you remember someone
at your house

613
00:58:06,179 --> 00:58:07,571
that might have looked that way?

614
00:58:08,615 --> 00:58:10,225
I don't know, sir.

615
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,905
You go see your mother,

616
00:58:16,906 --> 00:58:18,711
and tell me what she says

617
00:58:18,712 --> 00:58:20,453
about the person
who came to your house

618
00:58:20,454 --> 00:58:22,107
when you were a kid, understood?

619
00:58:22,108 --> 00:58:23,761
Yes, sir.

620
00:59:18,642 --> 00:59:20,557
Hi, Mom.

621
00:59:27,085 --> 00:59:28,652
Mm.

622
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:40,751
Will you tell me
the honest truth

623
00:59:40,752 --> 00:59:42,579
about something?

624
00:59:44,145 --> 00:59:46,582
I'll try.

625
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,194
Do you still say your prayers?

626
00:59:52,414 --> 00:59:54,415
No, Mom.

627
00:59:54,416 --> 00:59:57,463
I never said my prayers,
never once.

628
00:59:57,464 --> 00:59:59,117
They scared me.

629
01:00:12,871 --> 01:00:15,132
Ah...

630
01:00:19,138 --> 01:00:20,508
What's so funny?

631
01:00:20,509 --> 01:00:21,879
You're right.

632
01:00:23,315 --> 01:00:26,448
All our prayers don't help us.

633
01:00:28,929 --> 01:00:31,889
Prayers don't do
a goddamn thing.

634
01:00:37,068 --> 01:00:39,679
I'm gonna make you
something to eat.

635
01:01:03,137 --> 01:01:04,922
Jesus Christ, Mom.

636
01:01:38,607 --> 01:01:40,347
Good news.

637
01:01:40,348 --> 01:01:44,222
I got Deborah
to cover my shift tomorrow,

638
01:01:44,223 --> 01:01:47,268
and it's somebody's birthday.

639
01:02:51,376 --> 01:02:53,073
Lee?

640
01:03:02,822 --> 01:03:07,392
I can't believe it's gonna be
your birthday again so soon.

641
01:03:09,655 --> 01:03:11,613
What a day that was.

642
01:03:12,745 --> 01:03:14,615
I bled...

643
01:03:14,616 --> 01:03:17,228
bled... bled...

644
01:03:17,229 --> 01:03:18,055
bled...

645
01:03:18,056 --> 01:03:18,838
bled...

646
01:03:18,839 --> 01:03:20,405
Mom.

647
01:03:22,581 --> 01:03:24,888
Do you remember
my 9th birthday?

648
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,815
No, I don't think so.

649
01:03:42,514 --> 01:03:43,994
I don't remember anything.

650
01:03:43,995 --> 01:03:45,778
Do you?

651
01:03:53,394 --> 01:03:55,614
What happened that day?

652
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,486
No.

653
01:04:01,228 --> 01:04:02,664
What do you mean, "no"?

654
01:04:08,105 --> 01:04:10,498
"No" is just
the way it sounds, baby girl.

655
01:04:10,499 --> 01:04:12,892
But you called the police,

656
01:04:12,893 --> 01:04:14,807
about a trespasser.

657
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:20,465
No one ever came to visit us.

658
01:04:20,466 --> 01:04:22,750
Not any family.

659
01:04:22,751 --> 01:04:25,034
No strangers.

660
01:04:25,035 --> 01:04:27,385
No big, bad wolves.

661
01:04:27,386 --> 01:04:29,082
No anybody.

662
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:33,782
But these are things
a little girl shouldn't know.

663
01:04:33,783 --> 01:04:36,263
I'm not a child anymore, Mom.

664
01:04:37,482 --> 01:04:39,048
You're not a child

665
01:04:39,049 --> 01:04:41,921
because you were allowed
to grow up.

666
01:04:41,922 --> 01:04:42,965
Allowed?

667
01:04:42,966 --> 01:04:45,619
This is a cruel world.

668
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:48,013
Especially
for the little things.

669
01:04:48,014 --> 01:04:50,408
Not all of them
are allowed to live.

670
01:04:50,409 --> 01:04:51,843
What are you talking about?

671
01:04:51,844 --> 01:04:55,021
I might have forgotten
everything I possibly could,

672
01:04:55,022 --> 01:04:56,979
for both of our sakes,

673
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:59,634
but I never threw
anything away.

674
01:05:01,462 --> 01:05:03,203
All of your things...

675
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,251
...it's all in your room.

676
01:07:05,369 --> 01:07:08,111
Cheese and crackers!

677
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,854
Hey!

678
01:07:15,857 --> 01:07:16,988
Excuse me.

679
01:07:16,989 --> 01:07:18,120
Who are you,

680
01:07:18,121 --> 01:07:20,210
and why are you talking
to my kid?

681
01:07:28,087 --> 01:07:30,785

689
01:08:06,734 --> 01:08:08,345
Did you go see your mother?

690
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:11,738
What's this?

691
01:08:11,739 --> 01:08:13,632
It's him.

692
01:08:13,633 --> 01:08:15,525
It's him how?

693
01:08:15,526 --> 01:08:19,138
I found it in a box of photos
at my house.

694
01:08:19,139 --> 01:08:22,185
You really
don't remember this guy?

695
01:08:23,577 --> 01:08:25,317
Okay.

696
01:08:25,318 --> 01:08:27,581
We're gonna need
to bring her in,

697
01:08:27,582 --> 01:08:29,061
see what else she remembers.

698
01:08:29,062 --> 01:08:30,322
We will,

699
01:08:30,323 --> 01:08:32,803
but for now, we have this.

700
01:08:32,804 --> 01:08:36,242
You sure you wanna start
a manhunt with this?

701
01:08:36,243 --> 01:08:38,114
I'm sure.

702
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:41,654
Sir!

703
01:09:41,655 --> 01:09:44,092
I'm gonna need you to get down

It goes on like that
for a while.

725
01:11:28,154 --> 01:11:30,155
For how long?

726
01:11:30,156 --> 01:11:32,156
24 minutes.

727
01:11:32,157 --> 01:11:33,810
A'ight, everyone out of here.

728
01:11:33,811 --> 01:11:35,465
Browning, Harker, you stay.

729
01:11:35,466 --> 01:11:38,555
Go.
You guys go.

730
01:11:41,645 --> 01:11:43,647
His luggage was stuffed
with notebooks

731
01:11:43,648 --> 01:11:45,169
filled with handwriting.

732
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:47,955
Handwriting that matches
the letters found at the scene,

733
01:11:47,956 --> 01:11:52,220
and, suffice to say,
it's all heavily Satanic.

734
01:11:52,221 --> 01:11:53,830
Agent Harker,

735
01:11:53,831 --> 01:11:57,095
while the Bureau does appreciate
your contribution here,

736
01:11:57,096 --> 01:11:59,706
it also puts us
in an odd position.

737
01:12:00,751 --> 01:12:02,904
So far,
there's no physical evidence

738
01:12:02,905 --> 01:12:05,058
that Kobble has ever
killed anyone.

739
01:12:05,059 --> 01:12:07,192
I mean, he worships the Devil,
that's for sure,

740
01:12:07,193 --> 01:12:09,542
but in the United States
of America,

741
01:12:09,543 --> 01:12:11,543
he's allowed to do that.

742
01:12:11,544 --> 01:12:13,066
I'm more concerned
about the fact

743
01:12:13,067 --> 01:12:16,114
that he knows who you are,
Agent Harker.

744
01:12:16,115 --> 01:12:17,549
But...

745
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:19,073
he can't do anything else
about that

746
01:12:19,074 --> 01:12:21,684
now that we have him.

747
01:12:21,685 --> 01:12:24,622
"And I stood upon
the sand of the sea,

748
01:12:24,623 --> 01:12:27,560
and I saw a Beast rise up
out of the sea,

749
01:12:27,561 --> 01:12:30,170
with seven heads and ten horns.

750
01:12:30,171 --> 01:12:33,130
And on his horns,
he wore ten crowns,

751
01:12:33,131 --> 01:12:35,176
and on each head was written
the blasphemous name."

752
01:12:35,177 --> 01:12:37,135
Book of Revelations, isn't it?

753
01:12:37,136 --> 01:12:38,527
Revelation.

754
01:12:38,528 --> 01:12:40,356
There's no "S".
It's singular.

755
01:12:42,227 --> 01:12:44,707
Longlegs isn't alone.

756
01:12:44,708 --> 01:12:47,624
He has to have someone
helping him.

757
01:12:47,625 --> 01:12:50,148
Maybe multiple, but it...

758
01:12:50,149 --> 01:12:51,366
it has to be someone

759
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:52,716
that the families
felt comfortable

760
01:12:52,717 --> 01:12:54,412
letting into their house.

761
01:12:54,413 --> 01:12:57,285
Someone they know,
or have met before.

762
01:12:57,286 --> 01:13:00,679
Maybe a child, or...

763
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,029
someone that could pass
as a child.

764
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:03,726
A'ight, Harker, come on.

765
01:13:03,727 --> 01:13:06,382
We got the guy
who wrote the letters,

766
01:13:06,383 --> 01:13:07,643
and if we do this right,

767
01:13:07,644 --> 01:13:09,602
he'll spend
the rest of his life in jail.

768
01:13:09,603 --> 01:13:11,735
But it's not over.

769
01:13:13,127 --> 01:13:14,650
The triangle isn't complete,

770
01:13:14,651 --> 01:13:16,173
we're still missing the 13th.

771
01:13:16,174 --> 01:13:18,959
The 13th is today,
Agent Harker.

772
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,440
What are we supposed to do
about that?

773
01:13:21,441 --> 01:13:24,181
We can expect his accomplice

774
01:13:24,182 --> 01:13:26,706
to kill at least
one more family...

775
01:13:29,448 --> 01:13:31,624
...and Kobble's the only one
who knows who that is.

776
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,719
Kobble...

777
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:43,243
where is he now?

778
01:13:43,244 --> 01:13:45,159
He's downstairs.

779
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:47,466
Right under your feet.

780
01:13:53,037 --> 01:13:55,866
I'm a friend of a friend.

781
01:13:55,867 --> 01:13:57,650
What friend?

782
01:13:57,651 --> 01:14:00,043
My friend.

783
01:14:00,044 --> 01:14:02,133
That lives downstairs.

784
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:04,351
Downstairs?

785
01:14:04,352 --> 01:14:06,311
Downstairs from where?

786
01:14:06,312 --> 01:14:08,791
Everywheres.

787
01:14:08,792 --> 01:14:13,710
You can even call him
"Mr. Downstairs".

788
01:14:40,388 --> 01:14:42,260
Oh...

789
01:14:42,261 --> 01:14:46,393
there she is!

790
01:14:47,526 --> 01:14:50,877
The Almost Birthday Girl.

791
01:14:56,013 --> 01:14:58,319
Oh...

792
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,503
It's funny.

793
01:15:09,113 --> 01:15:12,769
The day you decided
to go into law enforcement,

794
01:15:12,770 --> 01:15:15,119
you were...

795
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,555
20.

796
01:15:18,905 --> 01:15:21,865
We had such a big laugh
about it.

797
01:15:24,694 --> 01:15:28,262
Although, it was only me
who laughed, not she.

798
01:15:30,134 --> 01:15:34,268
Who is the "she"
that you're talking about?

799
01:15:34,269 --> 01:15:36,879
The seventh "she".

800
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:41,406
To be given the same choice
that they've all been given.

801
01:15:41,407 --> 01:15:43,451
Crimson or clover.

802
01:15:45,453 --> 01:15:49,980
Accept the gift,
and destroy it,

803
01:15:49,981 --> 01:15:52,678
and destroy yourself,

804
01:15:52,679 --> 01:15:55,420
and your selves,

805
01:15:55,421 --> 01:15:57,400
or keep it,

806
01:15:57,401 --> 01:15:59,380
and bow down.

807
01:16:01,513 --> 01:16:05,212
Bow all the way down,

808
01:16:05,213 --> 01:16:08,911
and get right down

809
01:16:08,912 --> 01:16:13,306
to the dirty, dirty work.

810
01:16:13,307 --> 01:16:18,530
Work that gets dirty
as it cleans.

811
01:16:18,531 --> 01:16:21,358
Like a mop.

812
01:16:21,359 --> 01:16:25,276
Like a ra... ag.

813
01:16:27,017 --> 01:16:29,409
But...

814
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:31,935
you don't work alone, do you?

815
01:16:34,502 --> 01:16:36,374
Someone's been helping you.

816
01:16:39,638 --> 01:16:41,988
An accomplice.

817
01:16:44,164 --> 01:16:47,645
Knock-knock,
on the farmhouse door.

818
01:16:47,646 --> 01:16:51,302
A nice lady with a Bible
and a, "Congratulations!

819
01:16:51,303 --> 01:16:53,259
You have been selected.

820
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:56,307
You may now collect
your gift from the church."

821
01:16:56,308 --> 01:16:58,396
It says it right here,

822
01:16:58,397 --> 01:17:00,484
right here on the orders.

823
01:17:00,485 --> 01:17:02,921
On the orders
from the man downstairs.

824
01:17:02,922 --> 01:17:06,143
The Camera family farmhouse
will be so bright and white,

825
01:17:06,144 --> 01:17:09,232
you can't miss it!

826
01:17:09,233 --> 01:17:11,669
Are you referring
to Carrie Anne Camera?

827
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:14,630
What did you say to her
at the mental institution?

828
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,501
Oh, but, Lee,

829
01:17:17,502 --> 01:17:20,766
your house was even whiter
when I came to visit.

830
01:17:22,463 --> 01:17:26,815
January 13th, 1974, right?

831
01:17:26,816 --> 01:17:29,557
House Number Eight
was so white.

832
01:17:29,558 --> 01:17:31,603
Whiter than a fish's throat.

833
01:17:31,604 --> 01:17:33,039
Whiter than tits.

834
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,605
I knew then

835
01:17:34,606 --> 01:17:38,131
that the work we were doing
was immaculate.

836
01:17:41,613 --> 01:17:44,050
But your work's over.

837
01:17:44,051 --> 01:17:46,138
It's done,

838
01:17:46,139 --> 01:17:48,620
and you're gonna be in here
for the rest of your life.

839
01:17:53,146 --> 01:17:54,800
Yes.

840
01:17:57,063 --> 01:17:59,370
I am done...

841
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:05,636
...but I won't only be in here.

842
01:18:05,637 --> 01:18:10,294
I'll be a little bit
of everywhere.

843
01:18:12,296 --> 01:18:14,428
Waiting...

844
01:18:14,429 --> 01:18:16,561
in the wings.

845
01:18:20,565 --> 01:18:23,176
In the father's wings.

846
01:18:25,613 --> 01:18:27,964
Who's been helping you?

847
01:18:30,357 --> 01:18:31,881
Well...

848
01:18:33,796 --> 01:18:36,820
I'll let you get started now.

849
01:18:36,821 --> 01:18:39,845
Who is the man downstairs?

850
01:18:44,371 --> 01:18:47,548
Why don't you ask your mommy?

851
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:53,380
My mother
doesn't know anything.

852
01:18:59,647 --> 01:19:00,866
Hail Satan.

853
01:19:08,918 --> 01:19:10,789
Stop!

854
01:19:46,738 --> 01:19:48,348
That's it, Harker.

855
01:19:48,349 --> 01:19:49,263
That's more than enough.

856
01:19:49,264 --> 01:19:50,480
We had the guy,

857
01:19:50,481 --> 01:19:52,395
and now we got nothin'.

858
01:19:52,396 --> 01:19:54,440
We let all those families die,

859
01:19:54,441 --> 01:19:56,400
and nothin' about any of that
is better, or okay,

860
01:19:56,401 --> 01:19:57,793
but it's done!

861
01:19:58,532 --> 01:20:00,490
Oh, and as for the 13th...

862
01:20:00,491 --> 01:20:02,448
while you were in there,

863
01:20:02,449 --> 01:20:05,670
Carrie Anne Camera jumped
off the roof at Water Rock.

864
01:20:08,629 --> 01:20:09,934
Yeah.

865
01:20:09,935 --> 01:20:12,764
He must have told her to do that
when he saw her.

866
01:20:12,765 --> 01:20:14,505
Just like he somehow told
all the others

867
01:20:14,506 --> 01:20:15,722
to do what he wanted,

868
01:20:15,723 --> 01:20:18,878
but he did it alone,
with no accomplices!

869
01:20:18,879 --> 01:20:22,034
No black magic, no voodoo,
no nothing!

870
01:20:45,101 --> 01:20:47,842
You didn't
have to come with me.

871
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:51,194
I wasn't gonna let you drive
after what you saw today.

872
01:20:56,155 --> 01:20:58,244
How do you wanna do this?

873
01:20:59,811 --> 01:21:02,031
I should go in alone.

874
01:21:02,032 --> 01:21:03,248
I'll tell her

875
01:21:03,249 --> 01:21:05,903
we need to bring her in
for questioning.

876
01:21:05,904 --> 01:21:09,299
That we think she could help us
identify the accomplice.

877
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,823
All right.

878
01:21:12,824 --> 01:21:14,173
I'll stay right here.

879
01:21:58,217 --> 01:21:59,958
Mom?

880
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:37,561
Mom?

881
01:23:32,616 --> 01:23:33,703
Mom!

882
01:23:33,704 --> 01:23:36,620
Put the gun down!

883
01:23:48,414 --> 01:23:50,286
What is that thing?

884
01:23:51,678 --> 01:23:54,029
You caught him.

885
01:23:56,422 --> 01:23:57,858
Now he's free.

886
01:23:58,816 --> 01:24:00,818
You mean Kobble?

887
01:24:00,819 --> 01:24:02,601
But...

888
01:24:02,602 --> 01:24:05,344
But Kobble's de... he's gone.

889
01:24:05,345 --> 01:24:07,042
Kobble's dead.

890
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,480
It's okay, Mom.

891
01:24:10,481 --> 01:24:11,959
It's...

892
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:13,221
It's okay.

893
01:24:13,222 --> 01:24:14,483
It's...

894
01:24:14,484 --> 01:24:16,267
it's done now.

895
01:24:16,268 --> 01:24:19,706
And you're free, too,
baby girl.

896
01:25:02,575 --> 01:25:04,446
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

897
01:25:04,447 --> 01:25:06,579
<i>there was a girl named Lee.</i>

898
01:25:09,016 --> 01:25:12,150
<i>She lived in a little house
with her mother...</i>

899
01:25:15,893 --> 01:25:18,548
<i>and no one ever
came to visit them.</i>

900
01:25:20,289 --> 01:25:22,855
<i>No family.</i>

901
01:25:22,856 --> 01:25:25,597
<i>No big, bad wolves.</i>

902
01:25:25,598 --> 01:25:28,340
<i>No anyone.</i>

903
01:25:32,475 --> 01:25:36,305
<i>One day, a man did come...</i>

904
01:25:37,523 --> 01:25:39,524
Cuckoo!

905
01:25:39,525 --> 01:25:41,571
<i>...a doll maker.</i>

906
01:25:42,354 --> 01:25:46,619
Just dropping off
an early birthday gift,

907
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:48,447
a gift from the church.

908
01:25:49,970 --> 01:25:52,059
You've won!

909
01:25:54,410 --> 01:25:57,717
<i>The doll maker
started his work...</i>

910
01:26:00,329 --> 01:26:03,462
<i>...his terrible magic.</i>

911
01:26:06,813 --> 01:26:08,902
<i>The work of the Devil...</i>

912
01:26:12,036 --> 01:26:16,780
<i>...with a little bit of him...</i>

913
01:26:16,781 --> 01:26:18,521
<i>in every one.</i>

914
01:26:21,088 --> 01:26:24,765
<i>The doll made
the little girl forget...</i>

915
01:26:24,766 --> 01:26:27,475
<i>and told her
where to look...</i>

916
01:26:27,476 --> 01:26:30,185
<i>and what not to see.</i>

917
01:26:32,883 --> 01:26:36,929
<i>The Devil wanted
the little girl for his own,</i>

918
01:26:36,930 --> 01:26:39,324
<i>but her mother could never
let that happen.</i>

919
01:26:41,370 --> 01:26:45,134
You could've
made nice with me,

920
01:26:45,135 --> 01:26:48,899
but you didn't...

921
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:52,642
...and now that has led

922
01:26:52,643 --> 01:26:56,427
to all of this.

923
01:27:01,999 --> 01:27:04,130
<i>So her mother begged</i>

924
01:27:04,131 --> 01:27:06,786
<i>for the little girl's life
to be spared.</i>

925
01:27:08,266 --> 01:27:12,314
<i>In exchange,
she would have to help him.</i>

926
01:27:20,539 --> 01:27:22,715
<i>She had once been a nurse.</i>

927
01:27:25,283 --> 01:27:27,611
<i>Now her work would be...</i>

928
01:27:27,612 --> 01:27:29,940
<i>murdering families...</i>

929
01:27:37,861 --> 01:27:39,732
<i>...and so it went like this...</i>

930
01:27:41,995 --> 01:27:44,258
<i>...knock-knock-knock,</i>

931
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:45,782
<i>on the farmhouse door.</i>

932
01:27:47,087 --> 01:27:50,329
<i>A nice lady with a Bible...</i>

933
01:27:50,330 --> 01:27:53,572
<i>and a "Congratulations,</i>

934
01:27:53,573 --> 01:27:55,443
<i>you've won!</i>

935
01:27:55,444 --> 01:27:57,315
<i>A gift from the church."</i>

936
01:28:01,711 --> 01:28:04,278
<i>All her mother had to do...</i>

937
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:06,846
<i>was get it inside...</i>

938
01:28:11,373 --> 01:28:16,465
<i>...and from his hiding place
within the dolls,</i>

939
01:28:16,466 --> 01:28:19,294
<i>the Devil did the rest.</i>

940
01:28:28,912 --> 01:28:31,393
<i>All her mother had to do...</i>

941
01:28:31,394 --> 01:28:32,872
<i>was watch...</i>

942
01:28:34,091 --> 01:28:39,009
<i>...and make sure it happened
the way he wanted it to.</i>

943
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:45,407
<i>That was the deal
that she made.</i>

944
01:30:35,038 --> 01:30:37,953
<i>You're late...</i>

945
01:30:37,954 --> 01:30:40,870
<i>for Miss Ruby's birthday party.</i>

946
01:31:50,243 --> 01:31:52,332
Hey, Harker, you made it!

947
01:31:52,333 --> 01:31:53,855
Hi there, Harker.

948
01:31:53,856 --> 01:31:56,902
It's really nice that you came.

949
01:31:56,903 --> 01:31:58,555
Is everything okay?

950
01:31:58,556 --> 01:32:00,035
Of course, everything's great.

951
01:32:00,036 --> 01:32:01,776
In fact, you're here
just in time,

952
01:32:01,777 --> 01:32:03,817
because Miss Ruby just started
opening her presents.

953
01:32:05,171 --> 01:32:09,785
Come, sit. Sit.

954
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:25,235
No, Carter, that's my mom.

955
01:32:25,236 --> 01:32:26,278
She's the accomplice.

956
01:32:26,279 --> 01:32:27,193
She's Kobble's accomplice...

957
01:32:27,194 --> 01:32:28,630
Sit down!

958
01:32:34,461 --> 01:32:37,181
Oh, I'm so sorry,
I've forgotten your name.

959
01:32:37,182 --> 01:32:39,902
I'm a terrible,
terrible, terrible hostess.

960
01:32:39,903 --> 01:32:42,709
Oh, don't mind me.

961
01:32:42,710 --> 01:32:45,516
I'm just a friend

962
01:32:45,517 --> 01:32:47,779
of a friend.

963
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:48,997
No...

964
01:32:48,998 --> 01:32:50,695
Carter,
you have to listen to me.

965
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:01,924
Honey, maybe now would be
a good time

966
01:33:01,925 --> 01:33:03,316
to bring out the cake.

967
01:33:06,058 --> 01:33:08,626
The cakes.

968
01:33:08,627 --> 01:33:10,235
Yeah,

969
01:33:10,236 --> 01:33:12,412
I'll find something
to cut up the cakes with.

970
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:16,459
Uh...

971
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:18,114
What did you say, honey?

972
01:33:19,115 --> 01:33:20,811
I just said,
do you have to...?

973
01:33:20,812 --> 01:33:23,989
Do I have to...
Do I have to cut up the cakes?

974
01:33:23,990 --> 01:33:25,163
Yeah, I gotta cut the cakes.

975
01:33:25,164 --> 01:33:26,165
It was your stupid
fucking suggestion

976
01:33:26,166 --> 01:33:27,122
in the first place,

977
01:33:27,123 --> 01:33:30,516
so I have to cut the cakes.

978
01:33:30,517 --> 01:33:34,826
The woman is already dead...

979
01:33:34,827 --> 01:33:39,265
and the little girl
will be next.

980
01:33:42,312 --> 01:33:44,618
Anna...

981
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:48,579
would you like to join me
in the kitchen, honey?

982
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:50,777
I'm so sorry,
I'll be right back.

983
01:33:50,778 --> 01:33:52,724
No, I'll be right back.

984
01:33:52,725 --> 01:33:54,672
you'll still be in the kitchen.

985
01:34:03,289 --> 01:34:05,291
All three of them have to die.

986
01:34:09,687 --> 01:34:11,863
Mom, why are you doing this?

987
01:34:17,477 --> 01:34:19,718
If they don't die,

988
01:34:19,719 --> 01:34:21,960
then we will burn...

989
01:34:22,918 --> 01:34:24,788
...and twist,

990
01:34:24,789 --> 01:34:27,009
and burn, and twist,

991
01:34:27,010 --> 01:34:28,880
in hell...

992
01:34:28,881 --> 01:34:30,425
forever...

993
01:34:30,426 --> 01:34:31,970
and ever.

994
01:34:36,062 --> 01:34:38,237
I'm doing this for you...

995
01:34:40,196 --> 01:34:42,720
...just like I've always done.

996
01:34:49,422 --> 01:34:51,793
So that the little girl
named Lee

997
01:34:51,794 --> 01:34:54,166
would be allowed to grow up...

998
01:34:59,476 --> 01:35:02,131
...and that makes it right...

999
01:35:06,004 --> 01:35:08,703
...and so I'll do it again...

1000
01:35:08,704 --> 01:35:10,617
and again...

1001
01:35:10,618 --> 01:35:12,531
...and again...

1002
01:35:18,756 --> 01:35:22,150
<i>...And I'll do it</i>

1003
01:35:22,151 --> 01:35:25,544
<i>until I stand
upon the sand of the sea,</i>

1004
01:35:25,545 --> 01:35:30,942
<i>and I see a beast rise up
out of the sea.</i>

1005
01:35:35,512 --> 01:35:37,601
<i>Hail Satan.</i>

1006
01:35:48,003 --> 01:35:49,613
Carter, stop!

1007
01:35:58,230 --> 01:36:01,233
Move away from the girl!

1008
01:36:03,453 --> 01:36:04,801
Mom, please...

1009
01:36:04,802 --> 01:36:07,152
Don't call me that!

1010
01:36:28,695 --> 01:36:30,131
Hey...

1011
01:36:30,132 --> 01:36:31,698
Hey, come on.

1012
01:36:31,699 --> 01:36:33,483
