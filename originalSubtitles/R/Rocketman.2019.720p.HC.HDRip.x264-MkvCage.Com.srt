00:02:32,266 --> 00:02:33,634
How long is this gonna take?

3
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:36,204
That's really up to you.

4
00:02:36,603 --> 00:02:37,938
Right, then.

5
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:41,875
I know how this bit goes.

6
00:02:47,547 --> 00:02:50,517
My name is
Elton Hercules John...

7
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,393
and I'm an alcoholic.

8
00:03:03,297 --> 00:03:04,764
And a cocaine addict.

9
00:03:08,302 --> 00:03:09,536
And a sex addict.

10
00:03:12,606 --> 00:03:14,075
And a bulimic.

11
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,546
I'm also a shopaholic,
who has problems with weed...

12
00:03:20,314 --> 00:03:22,049
prescription drugs...

13
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:27,020
and anger management.

14
00:03:28,255 --> 00:03:29,387
Why are you here now?

15
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:30,955
Well, my dealer was out of town.

16
00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:32,993
I thought this seemed like
a good alternative.

17
00:03:41,202 --> 00:03:43,137
I'm here because
I want to get better.

18
00:03:43,703 --> 00:03:46,005
What were you like
as a child, Elton?

19
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:47,440

43

Reggie! You're late!

44
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:39,185
I've had to throw your dinner
in the bin! Get inside.

45
00:05:49,762 --> 00:05:50,996
Is he back?

46
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:53,565
What am I? Thin air?

47
00:05:54,366 --> 00:05:55,632
Wouldn't get your hopes up.

48
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:58,068
He's very unreliable
and very selfish.

49
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,338
But will you send him up
if I'm already in bed?

50
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,640
Reggie! Move!

51
00:06:02,007 --> 00:06:04,043
Got to get this done
before I go out.

52
00:06:07,347 --> 00:06:08,912
All right, all done.

53
00:06:08,914 --> 00:06:10,714
Put it away before you go out.

54
00:06:10,716 --> 00:06:12,617
Mum, I've got to go.

55
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:14,719
Where's my cardigan?

56
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:40,444
What?
Did I do something wrong?

57
00:06:40,446 --> 00:06:41,878
Bloody hell, Sheila.

58
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,782
Maybe we should
get him some lessons.

59
00:06:44,316 --> 00:06:47,618
Love to. Get him out
from under my feet.

60
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:52,724
Go on, play it again.

61
00:06:54,093 --> 00:06:55,794
I want to play it for Dad.

62
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:04,733
Managed to drag yourself
home then.

63
00:07:04,735 --> 00:07:07,104
- Hello, Stanley.
- How are you, Ivy?

64
00:07:07,106 --> 00:07:08,671
Like you care.

65
00:07:08,673 --> 00:07:10,342
Come on.
You're letting in a draft.

66
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,246
How long you back?

67
00:07:16,248 --> 00:07:17,783
I've got
a couple of weeks' leave.

68
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,417
Reggie's not long gone to bed.

69
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:22,921
Go on. Pop up, say hello.

70
00:07:23,688 --> 00:07:24,922
I'll see him tomorrow.

71
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:28,391
Any dinner left?

72
00:07:28,393 --> 00:07:30,828
Or have you fed it all
to that boy?

73
00:07:32,897 --> 00:07:34,799
My dad was passionate about...

74
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:37,869
family and music.

75
00:07:38,904 --> 00:07:41,039
He'd talk for hours about jazz.

76
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:43,273
He was always hugging me.

77
00:07:43,275 --> 00:07:44,309
I was very lucky.

78
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,749
I was actually
a very happy child.

79
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:02,691
Dad, is it true
you play piano?

80
00:08:02,693 --> 00:08:04,327
I'm saving to get lessons.

81
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:06,563
If you want to sit in here,
you'll have to be quiet.

82
00:08:06,565 --> 00:08:09,767
I'm listening to my music.

83
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:20,745
I like this one, Dad.

84
00:08:26,017 --> 00:08:29,388
Never, ever touch
my collection without asking.

85
00:08:40,064 --> 00:08:42,033
When are you going to hug me?

86
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:44,135
Don't be soft.

87
00:08:52,578 --> 00:08:54,111
What are you still doing up?

88
00:08:54,413 --> 00:08:55,414
Learning.

89
00:08:56,415 --> 00:08:58,283
Turn off the light.
Go to sleep.

90
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:01,610
Crumbs! That was energetic!

91
00:10:01,612 --> 00:10:03,180
Play another one.

92
00:10:03,714 --> 00:10:05,983
The "Moonlight Sonata," Reggie.

93
00:10:08,386 --> 00:10:11,053
Mum? My piano teacher
thinks I'm good enough

94
00:10:11,055 --> 00:10:13,423
for a scholarship
at the Royal Academy of Music.

95
00:10:14,725 --> 00:10:17,193
The Royal Academy of Music?

96
00:10:17,827 --> 00:10:20,130
It has a nice ring to it.

97
00:10:20,464 --> 00:10:21,499
"Royal."

98
00:10:21,865 --> 00:10:23,233
Scissors.

99
00:10:25,469 --> 00:10:28,539
- What do you think?
- The red one's good.

100
00:10:29,906 --> 00:10:33,275
- It's only on Saturdays.
- I've things to do on weekends.

101
00:10:33,277 --> 00:10:35,512
- Can't just drop everything.
- I'll take you.

102
00:10:38,148 --> 00:10:41,182
- Where are you off to?
- Don't know.

103
00:10:41,184 --> 00:10:42,485
Haven't decided yet.

104
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,790
But whatever it is,
you're not invited.

105
00:10:46,122 --> 00:10:49,493
Reggie's piano teacher thinks he's
good enough for a scholarship.

106
00:10:49,893 --> 00:10:50,927
Really?

107
00:10:51,395 --> 00:10:53,261
You think he's got
that kind of talent?

108
00:10:53,263 --> 00:10:55,631
Of course, he has.
But you'd know that

109
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:58,602
if you took the slightest bit of
interest in me or this family.

110
00:11:09,145 --> 00:11:11,314
Stop looking at that.
You're not a girl.

111
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,596
- Can we go home?
- Home? No going home.

112
00:11:28,598 --> 00:11:29,799
This is your life.

113
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,502
You have to get over
that silly shyness.

114
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,235
But Mum says I'll never...

115
00:11:34,237 --> 00:11:36,170
Everybody's frightened
at the beginning.

116
00:11:36,172 --> 00:11:38,508
You play at being confident.

117
00:11:39,576 --> 00:11:41,677
Life gives you
very few chances, Reggie,

118
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,046
and this is one of yours.

119
00:11:43,313 --> 00:11:45,146
You show 'em you can be
as good as they are.

120
00:11:45,148 --> 00:11:47,584
Better. Number one.
You can do that, can't you?

121
00:11:48,217 --> 00:11:51,319
- Yeah, I suppose.
- Good. Go on then. Here.

122
00:11:51,321 --> 00:11:54,324
Here's for a bag of chips
and your bus fare home.

123
00:12:11,507 --> 00:12:12,809
Reginald Dwight?

124
00:12:13,242 --> 00:12:15,477
- Yes.
- Hi. How do you do?

125
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,449
Good, thank you.

126
00:12:20,015 --> 00:12:21,484
Take your coat off.

127
00:12:24,387 --> 00:12:26,423
Did you not bring
something to play?

128
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:29,325
Didn't know I had to.

129
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,095
I see. Well...

130
00:12:34,197 --> 00:12:35,729
So, can you show me anything

131
00:12:35,731 --> 00:12:39,001
so I can get a sense
of where you're up to?

132
00:13:00,055 --> 00:13:01,457
Why have you stopped?

133
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:05,227
That's as far as you got.

134
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:10,497
You might have a good memory,
and a good ear,

135
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:12,735
but you've an awful lot
of work to do.

136
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,371
So, wrists and back straight.

137
00:13:16,972 --> 00:13:19,139
Let's start
with the C-major scale,

138
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:21,311
both hands, two octaves.

139
00:13:29,451 --> 00:13:32,020
Hands off the table, Reginald.
Stop making that noise.

140
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,692

Boy... There's a boy there.

171
00:16:09,443 --> 00:16:11,579
Reggie. What you doing?

172
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,684
Hello, son. I'm Fred.
I'm a friend of your mum's.

173
00:16:25,226 --> 00:16:28,061
You tied me down
with that kid years ago,

174
00:16:28,063 --> 00:16:30,763
and now I've finally
got a reason to leave

175
00:16:30,765 --> 00:16:34,002
and be rid of you
and this bloody house!

176
00:16:57,258 --> 00:16:59,492
He didn't even give me
a hug goodbye.

177
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:03,396
He's no good
at showing affection.

178
00:17:03,864 --> 00:17:05,432
Never has been.

179
00:17:08,102 --> 00:17:11,337
- I wish I was someone else.
- Oh, don't be silly.

180
00:17:16,711 --> 00:17:18,512
Well, how do you think I felt?

181
00:17:21,482 --> 00:17:22,750
I was a kid.

182
00:17:28,055 --> 00:17:29,489
Heartbroken.

183
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:34,494
People don't care though,
do they?

184
00:17:38,431 --> 00:17:39,667
Anyway...

185
00:17:42,536 --> 00:17:44,405
I'd discovered records.

186
00:17:46,307 --> 00:17:47,807
And rock 'n' roll.

187
00:17:54,148 --> 00:17:57,448
I know you like him.
He's quite a dish.

188
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,054
- I would.
- Oh, Mum!

189
00:18:00,487 --> 00:18:02,823
Thanks, Mum. It's fantastic.

190
00:18:03,057 --> 00:18:05,991
You serious about wanting
to be a rock 'n' roller?

191
00:18:05,993 --> 00:18:07,793
Yeah. Of course.

192
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,864
Better get you
the proper haircut, eh?

193
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,700
- Can I get it cut like Elvis?
- Enjoy it while it lasts.

194
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,733
He's like my side
of the family.

195
00:18:15,735 --> 00:18:18,404
He'll be bald as an egg
by the time he's 20.

196
00:18:38,024 --> 00:18:40,224
Congratulations to Dave.
He's won four pork chops,

197
00:18:40,226 --> 00:18:42,960
half a pound of prime mince
and a string of sausages.

198
00:18:42,962 --> 00:18:45,665
Thank you all! Thank you!

199
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:47,965
Now, Sheila and Fred's boy

200
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:50,269
is gonna sing us
a couple of songs on the piano.

201
00:18:50,271 --> 00:18:51,803

202
00:18:51,805 --> 00:18:53,606

203
00:18:54,074 --> 00:18:55,308
Go on, boy.

204
00:18:56,342 --> 00:18:58,509
Hello.

205
00:18:58,511 --> 00:19:00,747
Bloody hell.
Have you got a fag?

206
00:19:05,251 --> 00:19:06,553
Rubbish!

207
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,589
Reg, Reg,
play the one I like.

208
00:19:11,057 --> 00:19:12,158
Excuse me.

209
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:14,492
- You can't put that there.
- Why not?

210
00:19:14,494 --> 00:19:16,095

00:27:20,376 --> 00:27:23,443
All right,
Elton John the piano player.

352
00:27:23,445 --> 00:27:25,345
Thank you so much
for coming in.

353
00:27:25,347 --> 00:27:27,382
- Leave your details on your way...
- Please, Mr. Williams.

354
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,948
Give me a chance.

355
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,421
Um... all right.

356
00:27:31,621 --> 00:27:34,990
See if there's anything interesting
in this one and set it to music.

357
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,599
Okay.
Well, I'll see you soon.

358
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:47,400
Thank you for coming in.
Will I hear from you, or...

359
00:27:47,402 --> 00:27:49,071
We'll be in touch.
We'll be in touch. Thank you.

360
00:27:49,338 --> 00:27:52,240
Okay. Thanks so much
for your time.

361
00:27:52,775 --> 00:27:54,610
No worries. Come on.

362
00:28:08,591 --> 00:28:10,889
One frothy coffee, no froth.

363
00:28:10,891 --> 00:28:13,195
- Thanks.
- We close in an hour.

364
00:28:16,098 --> 00:28:18,631
- Bernie Taupin?
- Yeah. You must be Elton?

365
00:28:18,633 --> 00:28:19,699
- Yeah.
- Hi.

366
00:28:19,701 --> 00:28:21,269
Well, that's my stage name.

367
00:28:21,771 --> 00:28:25,107
You can tell me your real name when
we get to know each other better.

368
00:28:25,474 --> 00:28:26,509
Right.

369
00:28:28,043 --> 00:28:30,278
- Uh...
- Um...

370
00:28:31,481 --> 00:28:33,213
- I was thinking... Sorry.
- Have you ever... Sorry.

371
00:28:33,215 --> 00:28:35,182
No, no, please.
After you.

372
00:28:36,818 --> 00:28:38,953
- I like your lyrics.
- Thank you.

373
00:28:39,421 --> 00:28:42,290
Yeah, I got the tape
you sent. It's great.

374
00:28:42,824 --> 00:28:45,260
- Really good.
- Thanks.

375
00:28:45,994 --> 00:28:49,662
Hang on. Don't bother with that one.
That wasn't supposed to be in there.

376
00:28:49,664 --> 00:28:52,267
- That's sent by mistake.
- No, no, that's really good.

377
00:28:52,635 --> 00:28:54,236
I wrote a tune to it.

378
00:28:55,237 --> 00:28:56,903
- Yeah, I...
- "Border Song"?

379
00:28:56,905 --> 00:29:00,573
Yeah. I read it and I could
hear the whole tune in my head.

380
00:29:00,575 --> 00:29:03,810
It was all there, I could see all the
notes, and I just had to get it out.

381
00:29:03,812 --> 00:29:07,215
It was like my fingers couldn't work
fast enough to keep up with my brain.

382
00:29:09,418 --> 00:29:10,850
Do you ever get anything
like that?

383
00:29:10,852 --> 00:29:13,155
Uh... not really, no.

384
00:29:13,855 --> 00:29:16,057
But I can write more
for you, though, Elton.

385
00:29:16,658 --> 00:29:19,961
- I'll just send them down to you.
- Great. That'll be good.

386
00:29:20,863 --> 00:29:22,097
Great.

387
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,368
My real name's Reg Dwight.

388
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:30,705
Cool. Yeah, that sounds
like a cowboy name.

389
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,308
Yeah, all I ever...

390
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:35,675
All I ever wanted to be
was a cowboy, you see.

391
00:29:35,677 --> 00:29:37,579
Do you like
country and western music?

392
00:29:38,146 --> 00:29:39,978
- Yeah.
- It's good, isn't it?

393
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,350
Have you heard "Streets of
Laredo" by Marty Robbins?

394
00:29:43,084 --> 00:29:44,386
Mmm.

395
00:29:44,686 --> 00:29:45,720

- It's catchy, Dick.

429
00:31:52,546 --> 00:31:54,646
These guys are special.
I've got an instinct for these things.

430
00:31:54,648 --> 00:31:57,083
All right, don't break your
neck sucking your own cock.

431
00:31:58,052 --> 00:32:00,688
Maybe we could put these two
into a little beat combo.

432
00:32:00,955 --> 00:32:03,956
He's the good-looking one.
We'll make him the singer.

433
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:07,593
Oh, no, hold on. I'm tone-deaf.
Elton is... He sings the songs.

434
00:32:07,595 --> 00:32:09,963
Yeah, I could just take those
songs and leave, if you like.

435
00:32:09,965 --> 00:32:13,397
Whoa, all right, no offense.
Don't get your knickers in a twist.

436
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:15,666
They are writing
a lot of great tunes, Dick.

437
00:32:15,668 --> 00:32:17,635
There is one
that's perfect for Lulu.

438
00:32:17,637 --> 00:32:19,105
Easy, tiger.

439
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:21,842
You... You flatmates?

440
00:32:22,475 --> 00:32:24,476
No, we live with our mums.

441
00:32:24,478 --> 00:32:26,411
So I do the writing,

442
00:32:26,413 --> 00:32:28,281
I send it down to him,
and then he adds the music.

443
00:32:28,515 --> 00:32:30,749
Who ever heard of songwriters
not living together?

444
00:32:30,751 --> 00:32:33,287
Yes, Lennon and McCartney
are inseparable.

445
00:32:33,654 --> 00:32:35,987
- How many songs you got?
- Um, hundreds.

446
00:32:35,989 --> 00:32:37,290
Play another one.

447
00:32:39,258 --> 00:32:40,493

00:33:15,062 --> 00:33:17,561
Sounds like 99% of 'em are shit!

457
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:19,566
It's the one percent
I'm interested in.

458
00:33:21,602 --> 00:33:23,402
Ray says you're an investment.

459
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:25,438
But Ray knows fuck all.

460
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:28,341
You're a couple of pricks
as far as I can tell.

461
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:30,510
So quit that
backing-band nonsense,

462
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:34,278
find a place to work together,
and write me tunes

463
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,949
that gray-haired old tramps'll
whistle in the street.

464
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,151
You never know.

465
00:33:39,153 --> 00:33:41,554
One day, you might have
enough for an album.

466
00:33:41,989 --> 00:33:45,059
Do that, and I'll put you

- They're struggling rock stars.
- Hello. I'm Bernie.

472
00:34:12,085 --> 00:34:14,519
Who ever heard of a rock star
with the name Bernie?

473
00:34:18,091 --> 00:34:19,491
Lovely.

474
00:34:23,463 --> 00:34:26,099
So what are your plans
now... Elton?

475
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:28,199
Not too sure.

476
00:34:28,201 --> 00:34:30,503
Written a lot of songs,
haven't we? Enough for an album.

477
00:34:30,937 --> 00:34:33,539
And Elton's got
himself a girlfriend now.

478
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:36,943
Arabella,
our new landlady. Yep.

479
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:40,245
So what about rock 'n' roll?

480
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:44,016
What about hot chicks
and cocaine orgies?

481
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:45,685
What about fame and fortune?

482
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:48,453
What about the fact
that you're a fag?

483
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,292
A what?

484
00:34:54,961 --> 00:34:58,396
Your little friend
is a homosexual.

485
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:01,664
No, I've got a girlfriend.

486
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,603
When's that ever stopped anybody?

487
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:09,976
Are you?

488
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,014
Don't know.

489
00:35:18,885 --> 00:35:20,887
Would it matter
if I was, Bernie?

490
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:25,624
No, not to me.

491
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:31,228
Might matter to Arabella,
though.

492
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:35,498
- Yeah, mate, I'd agree on that.
- Have you met her?

493
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,903

"Who's that singing on the demos?" And I...

there is something
special that happens...

when you sing our songs.

518
00:36:56,282 --> 00:36:59,349
You heard what Dick said.
He said my hands are like midget boxers.

519
00:36:59,351 --> 00:37:00,885
Who cares what Dick thinks.

520
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,821
I just don't know if I'm...

521
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:06,390
what they're looking for.

522
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,832
It's time for you
to be out front.

523
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:22,840
I love you, man.

524
00:37:24,975 --> 00:37:26,410
I do, but...

525
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:28,946
not in that way.

526
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,155
Yeah.

527
00:37:38,722 --> 00:37:41,693
Elton, time for bed.

528
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:50,000
We became inseparable
after that.

529
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:52,903
The brother I never had.

530
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,704
Do you know, in 20 years,

531
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:59,574
we have never had
a single argument. Not once.

532
00:37:59,576 --> 00:38:02,780
Anyway, I took his advice,
told Arabella.

533
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,984
She took it very well,
actually.

534
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:10,618
You bastard!

535
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,120
She's killed my piano.

536
00:38:12,122 --> 00:38:14,725
You treacherous beast!

537
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:18,595
Your music's as shitty
as you are!

538
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,065
Hi, Mum.

539
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,634
I knew you'd be back.

540
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:27,504
You'll have to pay rent.
I'm not made of money.

541
00:38:35,745 --> 00:38:37,348
- Morning.
- Good morning.

542
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,017
- Get dressed, Reggie!
- Elton.

543
00:38:40,884 --> 00:38:42,987
I'm not having you
moping around here all day.

544
00:38:43,486 --> 00:38:44,521
We're songwriting.

545
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:47,658
Oh, yeah?
Looks like it's going well.

546
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:53,329
Right. I will not
have a mess in this house.

547
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,799
It's nice and tidy,
and that's how I want it to stay.

548
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:58,367
I'll not have
a doss house around here.

549
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:02,139
I can't do everything.
I can't cook and clean and wash.

550
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:05,307
Rely upon me to do everything.
It's not fair.

551
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:06,542
There's egg on this.

552
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:13,650
I'd better go
take a shave, I think.

553
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:22,892

How was that?

592
00:42:48,331 --> 00:42:51,267
I love it. Best thing I've
heard since "Let It Be."

593
00:42:51,467 --> 00:42:53,032
Trans-fucking-Atlantic!

594
00:42:53,034 --> 00:42:54,836
Always knew
you boys could do it.

595
00:42:55,404 --> 00:42:58,073
First thing I'm gonna do is
put you on a three-album deal.

596
00:42:58,306 --> 00:43:00,875
- Three?
- A year.

597
00:43:01,376 --> 00:43:03,676
And I got you a couple of
nights at the Troubadour.

598
00:43:03,678 --> 00:43:06,881
- Doug Weston's an old friend.
- Hang on. The Troubadour?

599
00:43:07,182 --> 00:43:10,450
- It's this really cool folk club in LA.
- Yeah, we know what it is, Ray.

600
00:43:10,452 --> 00:43:12,453
Hang on. Now, let's not be
hasty, because the thing is,

601
00:43:12,455 --> 00:43:14,120
I haven't even got
a backing band yet.

602
00:43:14,122 --> 00:43:15,924
No, I've sorted the backup
band, don't worry.

603
00:43:16,258 --> 00:43:17,924
Dick, I don't wanna
appear ungrateful,

604
00:43:17,926 --> 00:43:19,460
but you can't just spring
the Troubadour on me.

605
00:43:19,462 --> 00:43:21,730
Look, it's time to do
something bold, Elton.

606
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:24,666
Granted, America's
a bit of a gamble,

607
00:43:25,166 --> 00:43:26,968
and you fuck up
and I'll kill ya.

608
00:43:27,902 --> 00:43:30,205
But Ray'll go, too.
He'll keep an eye on you.

609
00:43:30,672 --> 00:43:34,809
Buy yourself some new clothes.
Get something flashy.

610
00:43:35,577 --> 00:43:37,212
Let 'em know who you are.

611
00:43:38,046 --> 00:43:40,215
Put on a great fucking show,

612
00:43:41,517 --> 00:43:43,686
and just don't
kill yourself with drugs.

613
00:43:43,985 --> 00:43:45,853
Yeah?

614
00:43:46,454 --> 00:43:47,455
Yeah, all right.

615
00:43:48,623 --> 00:43:50,090
I'm gonna have a massage.

616
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:52,460

Good to see you, Doug.

629
00:44:49,517 --> 00:44:51,486
Ray.

630
00:44:51,852 --> 00:44:53,786
How are you?
So good to see you, man.

631
00:44:53,788 --> 00:44:55,054
What'd you bring me?

632
00:44:55,056 --> 00:44:56,923
Hey, Doug. Bernie.
Nice to meet you.

633
00:44:56,925 --> 00:44:58,325
- Hi, Bernie.
- Good morning.

634
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:00,625
- Hi. I'm Elton.
- Oh.

635
00:45:00,627 --> 00:45:02,294
Sweet. How are you?

636
00:45:02,296 --> 00:45:04,863
Monday night at the Troubadour, man.

637
00:45:04,865 --> 00:45:06,365
It's gonna blow your mind.

638
00:45:06,367 --> 00:45:08,670
Be totally packed.
You're gonna love it.

639
00:45:09,069 --> 00:45:11,002
It's a bit different
from what I expected.

640
00:45:11,004 --> 00:45:12,039
Yeah?

641
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,106
Yeah, it's just a bit smaller.

642
00:45:14,108 --> 00:45:16,108
Well, size is
everything, my friend.

643
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:17,744
Neil Young
played here last week

644
00:45:17,746 --> 00:45:20,513
and there were people lined
around the block.

645
00:45:20,515 --> 00:45:22,716
Man, it was just...
It was the best night ever.

646
00:45:23,217 --> 00:45:25,185
- That's a cool hat.
- Yeah?

647
00:45:25,552 --> 00:45:27,755
- You like it?
- I do like it, yeah.

648
00:45:28,455 --> 00:45:30,522
- I won that hat, in a bet.
- Oh.

649
00:45:30,524 --> 00:45:32,124
- With Bob Dylan.
- Really?

650
00:45:32,126 --> 00:45:33,325
- Yeah.
- That's cool.

651
00:45:33,327 --> 00:45:34,960
Elton. This is the band.

652
00:45:34,962 --> 00:45:37,129
I'm just gonna check
they know what they're doing.

653
00:45:37,131 --> 00:45:39,732
So, you want something to drink?
Get these guys whatever they want.

654
00:45:39,734 --> 00:45:41,168
They just flew in from England

655
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:43,405
and, boy, their arms are tired.

656
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:52,279
Whoa, dude,
what the hell are you wearing?

657
00:45:55,482 --> 00:45:56,483
My stage gear.

658
00:45:56,885 --> 00:45:59,317
Where's Reggie? Where's Reggie?
Reggie, Reggie, Reggie.

659
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:01,987
Neil Diamond is at the bar.
He's talking to Leon Russell

660
00:46:01,989 --> 00:46:05,192
and half the fucking
Beach Boys. Huh?

661
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:10,263
Jesus, shit, Bernie!

662
00:46:11,164 --> 00:46:12,399
Reggie?

663
00:46:12,733 --> 00:46:15,335
- Elton. I think you're overreacting.
- No.

664
00:46:16,002 --> 00:46:18,703
Bernie, you are under-reacting.

665
00:46:18,705 --> 00:46:21,273
They are the geniuses
of American music.

666
00:46:21,275 --> 00:46:23,008
I can't go out there
in front of that lot!

667
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:27,279
Okay, okay. Then we'll tell Doug
to refund everyone's ticket,

668
00:46:27,281 --> 00:46:29,381
- and we'll send everybody home.
- Where is he?

669
00:46:29,383 --> 00:46:32,217
- Hey, Ray.
- You've signed a contract!

670
00:46:32,219 --> 00:46:33,752
Dick's paid
your fucking airfare!

671
00:46:33,754 --> 00:46:36,389
Now get out there and play,
you little twat.

672
00:46:44,264 --> 00:46:45,466
Well, come on then.

673
00:46:46,567 --> 00:46:48,535
And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:46:48,869 --> 00:46:51,104

- This is... This is Heather.
- Hi.

712
00:50:20,046 --> 00:50:21,780
- Hello.
- You were amazing!

713
00:50:22,982 --> 00:50:24,182
Thank you.

714
00:50:25,084 --> 00:50:27,785
All right.
Enough of this bullshit.

715
00:50:27,787 --> 00:50:30,188
Who wants to go
to a party at Mama Cass's?

716
00:50:30,856 --> 00:50:34,492
I'm so drunk, and Doug's
just lent me his car.

717
00:50:56,548 --> 00:51:00,384
- How cool is this, man?
- Yeah, great.

718
00:51:01,385 --> 00:51:03,287
Apparently Dylan's
here somewhere.

719
00:51:06,223 --> 00:51:07,392
Uh...

720
00:51:07,826 --> 00:51:09,961
I'm gonna go to the teepee
with Heather.

721
00:51:10,762 --> 00:51:12,764
- Really? All right.
- Yeah.

722
00:51:13,898 --> 00:51:14,933
Okay.

723
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,201
- You'll be all right, won't you?
- Yeah, of course.

724
00:51:17,203 --> 00:51:18,436
Yeah, yeah.

725
00:51:24,641 --> 00:51:26,745
So we still gonna go to
Tower Records tomorrow, then?

726
00:51:27,212 --> 00:51:31,549
Uh, well, she's talking about going to
some place called Paradise Cove tomorrow.

727
00:51:33,685 --> 00:51:35,485
But we'll go
another time, though.

728
00:51:35,487 --> 00:51:37,322
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

729
00:51:37,655 --> 00:51:38,656
Come on.

Elton.

767
00:55:05,895 --> 00:55:07,928
I know it all seems
a bit overwhelming at first,

768
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:10,599
but something makes me think
you'll get used to it.

769
00:55:12,635 --> 00:55:16,173
In fact, I predict you could be the
best-selling artist in America if you desire.

770
00:55:16,572 --> 00:55:18,008
So you like the song then?

771
00:55:18,574 --> 00:55:20,509
Not quite as much
as the singer.

772
00:55:25,815 --> 00:55:28,985
You don't realize what happened
at the Troubadour tonight, do you?

773
00:55:30,086 --> 00:55:32,553
Look, I'm in music management,
and let me tell you,

774
00:55:32,555 --> 00:55:36,592
there are moments in a rock
star's life that define who he is

775
00:55:37,427 --> 00:55:41,864
and how people perceive him
as he ascends into the heavens.

776
00:55:44,733 --> 00:55:46,202
You lit the blue touch paper.

777
00:55:46,601 --> 00:55:51,007
Now we can all see you
shooting light and color and...

778
00:55:51,741 --> 00:55:54,577
magic into the night sky.

779

there is now you.

780
00:56:02,285 --> 00:56:03,652

00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:08,656
You can do anything you want.

782
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:12,028
You can be anyone you want.

783
00:56:14,696 --> 00:56:16,731

Our review from the <i>LA Times</i>
has been syndicated.

801
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:39,580
- Okay.
- Things are going crazy. I've extended our stay.

802
00:57:39,582 --> 00:57:41,781
We're in San Francisco
tomorrow for three nights.

803
00:57:41,783 --> 00:57:43,450
- Ray, slow down.
- After that we fly to NYC,

804
00:57:43,452 --> 00:57:45,719
then we're back here for
two more shows, and then...

805
00:57:45,987 --> 00:57:48,389
Dick wants us back in London
to start the new album.

806
00:57:48,957 --> 00:57:50,890
- Doug.
- "Rejoice.

807
00:57:50,892 --> 00:57:53,192
Rock music has a new star.

808
00:57:53,194 --> 00:57:56,963
He's Englishman Elton John,
a 23-year-old,

809
00:57:56,965 --> 00:58:02,737
whose debut at the Troubadour
was, in every way, magnificent."

810
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:04,737
Whoo!

811
00:58:04,739 --> 00:58:05,940
It's happening, guys.

812
00:58:06,242 --> 00:58:07,876
Just remember,
when you get back...

813
00:58:08,344 --> 00:58:09,776
four shows you owe me.

814
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:14,015
- You said...
- Four.

815
00:58:14,415 --> 00:58:15,850
Did... You said four shows?

816
00:58:16,151 --> 00:58:18,384
- Yes.
- That's not gonna work!

817
00:58:18,386 --> 00:58:19,420
So...

818
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:24,157
will I see you
when I get back?

819
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:27,494
Now, don't worry about me.
Go and enjoy your moment.

820
00:58:27,496 --> 00:58:30,031
- That's what's important.
- Come to London with me.

821
00:58:31,099 --> 00:58:32,731
I can't, but, uh...

822
00:58:32,733 --> 00:58:35,802
But next time I'm there,
I'll look you up. Promise.

823
00:58:36,104 --> 00:58:38,538

the piano in those?

829
00:59:19,047 --> 00:59:20,981

town, I'd look you up.

I've been hearing

01:01:05,152 --> 01:01:06,685
Elton, what's going on?

861
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:08,488
Are we going again
or shall we go for a pint?

862
01:01:13,994 --> 01:01:16,096
Yeah, no, yeah,
you should go for a pint.

863
01:01:31,144 --> 01:01:32,479
What do you want, Elton?

864
01:01:32,845 --> 01:01:34,546
Dinner with you.

865
01:01:34,548 --> 01:01:36,783
You're so humble,
it's embarrassing.

866
01:01:37,384 --> 01:01:40,120
A millionaire rock star who
lives at home with his mum.

867
01:01:42,255 --> 01:01:43,590
Things are serious now.

868
01:01:43,924 --> 01:01:46,425
Be brave. Think big.

869
01:01:47,627 --> 01:01:48,928
What do you really want?

No one's
getting phased out, Dick.

904
01:04:03,295 --> 01:04:06,699
Elton feels things will run more
smoothly if he has personal management.

905
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,870
- There's never been a problem before.
- And there isn't one now.

906
01:04:11,737 --> 01:04:14,905
Look, there's loads of work and
commitments, tours, etcetera.

907
01:04:14,907 --> 01:04:17,139
That's what I'll be doing,
personal management.

908
01:04:17,141 --> 01:04:19,143
- Taking care of things.
- Is that right?

909
01:04:19,478 --> 01:04:21,478
You realize I've got
a contract with Elton.

910
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,012
I've had that looked into,

911
01:04:23,014 --> 01:04:24,381
and my client
is quite entitled

912
01:04:24,383 --> 01:04:25,883
to take on
outside representation.

913
01:04:25,885 --> 01:04:27,286
That's what you think.

914
01:04:28,988 --> 01:04:32,124
You fucking poofter.

915
01:04:33,893 --> 01:04:36,728
And you. You're happy
with this arrangement, are ya?

916
01:04:37,161 --> 01:04:38,396
Right?

917
01:04:38,696 --> 01:04:39,899
After all these years?

918
01:04:40,298 --> 01:04:42,033
It's nothing personal, Dick.

919
01:04:45,938 --> 01:04:47,171
Come on, Ray.

920
01:04:51,810 --> 01:04:53,379
Best of luck to you, Elton.

921
01:04:58,216 --> 01:05:01,586
Your very expensive painting
is upside down.

922
01:05:04,355 --> 01:05:07,358
- After you, Mr. James.
- Thank you, Raymond.

923
01:05:09,193 --> 01:05:10,796
Well...

924
01:05:11,262 --> 01:05:13,298
that was absolutely horrible.

925
01:05:13,899 --> 01:05:16,700
Don't worry, it's business.
Dick's a big boy, he'll be fine.

926
01:05:16,702 --> 01:05:20,770
Mr. Reid, Lord Grade's office have called
about the Royal Variety Performance.

927
01:05:20,772 --> 01:05:22,972
Apparently,
the Queen Mother is a big fan.

928
01:05:22,974 --> 01:05:26,309
Couldn't we have kept on Ray?
He's such a lovely guy.

929
01:05:26,311 --> 01:05:28,146
"Lovely guy" is not a job.

930
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,382
This is a crucial time,
Elton.

931
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:34,383
You and I are gonna
have to be more careful,

932
01:05:34,385 --> 01:05:36,053
'cause the papers
have been sniffing around.

933
01:05:36,055 --> 01:05:38,523
We can't give them
anything to speculate on.

934
01:05:38,824 --> 01:05:41,125
I'm thinking of getting
someone in as your girlfriend.

935
01:05:41,827 --> 01:05:44,328
- Doesn't that seem a bit excessive?
- No, no, no, no, no.

936
01:05:44,529 --> 01:05:46,596
This is your career
and our business at stake.

937
01:05:46,598 --> 01:05:49,099
If our sleeping
arrangements get out...

938
01:05:49,467 --> 01:05:51,402
- all of this is gone.
- Right.

939
01:05:51,836 --> 01:05:54,005
And you're gonna have
to talk to your parents.

940
01:05:54,472 --> 01:05:56,038
Make sure they know
what to say.

941
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:58,109
Those are the first doors
reporters knock on.

942
01:06:07,987 --> 01:06:11,121
- Hello, Reg.
- Hello, Dad.

943
01:06:17,127 --> 01:06:19,664
Well, come on in.

944
01:06:21,032 --> 01:06:23,234
Well, those are
very fancy shoes.

945
01:06:23,735 --> 01:06:25,470
Oh. Yeah.

946
01:06:27,271 --> 01:06:28,506
I brought you something.

947
01:06:38,148 --> 01:06:39,383
Why are you here, Reg?

948
01:06:41,786 --> 01:06:43,686
The boys.

949
01:06:47,257 --> 01:06:49,458
Dad, there's
a Rolls-Royce outside.

950
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:51,329
Stephen, Geoff...

951
01:06:52,263 --> 01:06:54,599
this is your brother, Reggie.

952
01:06:54,866 --> 01:06:55,967
Half brother.

953
01:06:56,433 --> 01:06:58,402
Not actually called
Reggie anymore.

954
01:06:59,736 --> 01:07:00,604
Hmm.

955
01:07:01,139 --> 01:07:03,005
I thought maybe
once I'm back from touring,

956
01:07:03,007 --> 01:07:04,976
you and I could
get together, if you like.

957
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:08,445
I could get you some tickets
to my next concert.

958
01:07:09,179 --> 01:07:11,381
Not really my thing.

959
01:07:12,817 --> 01:07:15,920
Is it true
you're worth 25 million pound?

960
01:07:16,354 --> 01:07:18,487
Do you know,
I don't actually know.

961
01:07:18,489 --> 01:07:21,058
They're really
proud of you. Mmm.

962
01:07:21,692 --> 01:07:24,428
Yeah, we've even got
some of your records.

963
01:07:24,928 --> 01:07:28,265
Why don't you go and get the album?
Grab us a pen.

964
01:07:33,570 --> 01:07:37,642
You probably get asked this all the
time, but would you...

965
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:40,210
Would you mind signing this?

966
01:07:43,915 --> 01:07:45,247
Yeah, of course.

967
01:07:50,887 --> 01:07:53,824
Oh, no. Would you
make it out to Arthur?

968
01:07:55,258 --> 01:07:57,260
He's one of the blokes
from work.

969
01:07:57,594 --> 01:07:59,229
Yeah, he's a big fan.

970
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:02,532
- Is he?
- Mm-hmm.

971
01:08:10,807 --> 01:08:11,808
Perfect.

972
01:08:14,778 --> 01:08:15,812
Right.

973
01:08:17,246 --> 01:08:20,584
Well, looks like things worked out
really well second time around, Dad.

974
01:08:21,518 --> 01:08:22,719
- I suppose they have.
- Mmm.

975
01:08:23,353 --> 01:08:25,856
'Cause, you know,
not everybody gets a second chance.

976
01:08:30,761 --> 01:08:33,997
The boys loved
meeting a real-life pop star.

977
01:08:34,497 --> 01:08:36,565
Sure. Thanks, Dad.

978
01:08:36,967 --> 01:08:38,001
Bye.

979
01:08:41,037 --> 01:08:42,837
- When I grow up, Dad...
- Get inside.

980
01:08:42,839 --> 01:08:45,609
What are you doing
without your shoes on?

981
01:08:46,543 --> 01:08:48,378
You're gonna be a draftsman.

982
01:08:50,113 --> 01:08:51,448
Back inside.

983
01:09:18,842 --> 01:09:21,610
What have you got to do to get
a fucking drink around here, eh?

984
01:09:29,518 --> 01:09:30,987
Will you stop sulking?

985
01:09:32,923 --> 01:09:35,025
It has to be done
whether you like it or not.

986
01:09:35,558 --> 01:09:37,761
Are you gonna be scared of her
your whole life?

987
01:09:39,596 --> 01:09:40,829
Right, stop the car.

988
01:09:40,831 --> 01:09:43,366
- Elton...
- I said, stop the car!

989
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:50,739
You're onstage in 15 minutes.

990
01:09:51,941 --> 01:09:54,441
You're the big-shot manager.
You make my excuses.

991
01:09:54,443 --> 01:09:58,614
Tell them I'm indisposed,
breaking my mother's heart!

992
01:09:59,249 --> 01:10:00,815
Elton. Elton!

993
01:10:00,817 --> 01:10:02,484
Drive 'round, Denis.

994
01:10:02,853 --> 01:10:04,351
<i>Liberace!</i>

995
01:10:12,695 --> 01:10:14,928
Pinner nine, seven,
double-five.

996
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:17,666
- Mum, it's me.
- <i>I know who you are.</i>

997
01:10:19,535 --> 01:10:21,102
Well, I've got something
to tell you.

998
01:10:21,104 --> 01:10:24,072
Reggie, we're gonna miss
the bit of the show with you on.

999
01:10:24,074 --> 01:10:25,507
Look, shut up, Mum!

1000
01:10:26,209 --> 01:10:28,377
I'm not on telly yet, am I?
I'm talking to you.

1001
01:10:30,512 --> 01:10:31,748
I...

1002
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,983
Me and John, we...

1003
01:10:36,185 --> 01:10:37,485
Well, the thing is...

1004
01:10:41,223 --> 01:10:44,059
I'm... a homosexual.

1005
01:10:48,397 --> 01:10:49,932
A poofter.

1006
01:10:51,268 --> 01:10:52,668
A fairy.

1007
01:10:53,435 --> 01:10:54,637
A queen.

1008
01:11:00,142 --> 01:11:01,542
Well, say something.

1009
01:11:05,014 --> 01:11:07,583
Oh, for God's sake,
I know that.

1010
01:11:10,019 --> 01:11:11,120
Known for years.

1011
01:11:13,555 --> 01:11:16,125
- You don't mind?
- Frankly, I don't care.

1012
01:11:16,892 --> 01:11:19,994
But I'd rather you keep
that sort of thing to yourself.

1013
01:11:22,231 --> 01:11:24,563
I just hope you realize
you're choosing a life

1014
01:11:24,565 --> 01:11:26,201
of being alone forever.

1015
01:11:27,369 --> 01:11:29,772
You'll never be loved properly.

1016
01:11:35,577 --> 01:11:37,579
<i>Right. Got to go.</i>

1017
01:11:46,721 --> 01:11:48,656
She said I'll never be loved.

1018
01:11:49,991 --> 01:11:51,857
Don't ever put me
in this position again.

1019
01:11:51,859 --> 01:11:53,126
You're onstage in 10 minutes,

1020
01:11:53,128 --> 01:11:54,928
so get over yourself
and do the show.

1021
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:56,932
We're running a business here,
you fucking idiot.

1022
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,970
Don't ever put your hands on me.

1023
01:12:05,674 --> 01:12:07,742
Real love's hard to come by.

1024
01:12:14,949 --> 01:12:16,851
So you find a way
to cope without it.

1025
01:13:18,813 --> 01:13:20,547
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1026
01:13:21,049 --> 01:13:23,282
Got the number-one album
in America. Again.

1027
01:13:23,284 --> 01:13:27,685
I'm about to embark on the
highest-grossing tour in rock history.

1028
01:13:27,687 --> 01:13:29,621
I'm personally responsible
for five percent

1029
01:13:29,623 --> 01:13:31,991
of all record sales
on the entire planet,

1030
01:13:31,993 --> 01:13:34,860
and I have the biggest
headdress known to man.

1031
01:13:34,862 --> 01:13:36,829
So, yeah,
I think I'm okay, Bernie.

1032
01:13:36,831 --> 01:13:38,597
It used to just be
the two of us.

1033
01:13:38,599 --> 01:13:40,733
Now there's busloads of people
just to do the music.

1034
01:13:40,735 --> 01:13:42,502
Hang on, hang on,
don't you wanna just

1035
01:13:42,504 --> 01:13:45,206
go out there and sing without
this ridiculous paraphernalia?

1036
01:13:45,839 --> 01:13:49,043
You know,
just be yourself, Reg?

1037
01:13:50,211 --> 01:13:52,945
Why the fuck
would I want that, Bernie?

1038
01:13:52,947 --> 01:13:55,948
You wouldn't say this shit to me
if you were a real friend.

1039
01:13:55,950 --> 01:13:58,616
People don't pay
to see Reginald Dwight.

1040
01:13:58,618 --> 01:14:01,120
They pay to see Elton John!

1041
01:14:01,122 --> 01:14:04,292
Don't ever tell me
how to do my fucking job!

1042
01:14:11,265 --> 01:14:12,300
Break a leg.

1043
01:14:15,136 --> 01:14:16,668
You don't have
to put up with this, Reg.

1044
01:14:16,670 --> 01:14:18,905
Write the fucking lyrics,
Bernie!

1045
01:14:19,606 --> 01:14:21,342
Let me deal with the rest.

1046
01:14:27,014 --> 01:14:28,547
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

1047
01:14:28,549 --> 01:14:30,983
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

1048
01:14:30,985 --> 01:14:35,253

1060
01:15:52,032 --> 01:15:55,268
- Where am I?
- At your house in LA, Mr. John.

1061
01:15:57,204 --> 01:15:58,238
Right.

1062
01:15:59,506 --> 01:16:01,007
I'll put some coffee on.

1063
01:16:09,782 --> 01:16:12,783
Darling, I've been thinking,
maybe we should quit the booze

1064
01:16:12,785 --> 01:16:15,322
for a couple of days,
take some quality time together...

1065
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:18,258
Afternoon.

1066
01:16:19,725 --> 01:16:20,961
Mr. Reid.

1067
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,701
- What are you doing, John?
- Just a bit of rock 'n' roll.

1068
01:16:28,703 --> 01:16:31,538
Rock 'n' roll is not shagging your
secretary in front of the pool boys!

1069
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:34,407
Rock 'n' roll is getting you
out of your bed in the morning.

1070
01:16:34,641 --> 01:16:37,542
Arranging 250 gigs
in 26 different countries.

1071
01:16:37,544 --> 01:16:40,413
Rock 'n' roll's actually
112 employment contracts,

1072
01:16:40,647 --> 01:16:42,447
insurance, copyright indemnity,

1073
01:16:42,449 --> 01:16:44,582
renegotiating your
previously insane contracts

1074
01:16:44,584 --> 01:16:46,150
and wiping your arse.

1075
01:16:46,152 --> 01:16:48,219
You know, all you do, Elton,
is play the piano.

1076
01:16:48,221 --> 01:16:51,356
But for me, rock 'n' roll is an 87
million-dollar-a-year industry.

1077
01:16:51,358 --> 01:16:54,060
Maybe I just play the piano,
but you know what else I do?

1078
01:16:54,461 --> 01:16:56,795
Hmm? I pay, John.

1079
01:16:57,596 --> 01:16:58,831
For everything.

1080
01:16:59,164 --> 01:17:01,367
Including this house,
which I'd like you to leave now.

1081
01:17:01,767 --> 01:17:05,068
You may still be my manager,
but you and me are finished.

1082
01:17:05,070 --> 01:17:07,070
- You're so predictable.
- No, not predictable.

1083
01:17:07,072 --> 01:17:08,640
I want to be by myself,

1084
01:17:08,642 --> 01:17:12,143
not with some asshole
who doesn't give a shit about me

1085
01:17:12,145 --> 01:17:15,115
and takes the piss
day after day!

1086
01:17:15,382 --> 01:17:17,881
- Get out!
- Yoo-hoo!

1087
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:19,451
Elton.

1088
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,052
What are they doing here?

1089
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:23,353
You told me to hire a jet

1090
01:17:23,355 --> 01:17:24,691
and fly them over
for the gig.

1091
01:17:25,357 --> 01:17:28,492
- No, no, next week, John.
- It is next week.

1092
01:17:28,494 --> 01:17:30,227
I'm gonna go
and fetch them a drink.

1093
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:31,928
Darling, why don't you
clean yourself up,

1094
01:17:31,930 --> 01:17:33,297
because you fucking stink.

1095
01:17:33,299 --> 01:17:36,869
Sheila! It's been too long.

1096
01:17:37,337 --> 01:17:39,936
- Beautiful woman.
- Hello, look at this, you lovely lot.

1097
01:17:39,938 --> 01:17:41,274
- Here we are.
- Hi, Nan.

1098
01:17:42,007 --> 01:17:45,142
- I can't believe I'm actually in America.
- I know.

1099
01:17:45,144 --> 01:17:46,779
- Hi, Dad.
- How you doing? Good to see you.

1100
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:48,645
- Elton.
- Hello, Mum.

1101
01:17:48,647 --> 01:17:51,248
Elton, darling,
you remember the Andersons

1102
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,483
- from next door, don't you?
- Yes, the Andersons.

1103
01:17:53,485 --> 01:17:55,287
How could we forget
the Andersons?

1104
01:17:55,587 --> 01:17:56,822
- Hello.
- Hello.

1105
01:17:58,857 --> 01:18:01,761
And what a shy little boy
you were.

1106
01:18:02,027 --> 01:18:03,561
Look at you now.

1107
01:18:03,563 --> 01:18:05,929
Elton, you must
give them a tour.

1108
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:07,331
- Yes, right now, go on.
- Yeah, okay.

1109
01:18:07,333 --> 01:18:09,065
Everyone,
Elton is giving a tour.

1110
01:18:09,067 --> 01:18:11,834
- Mum, you're on my gown.
- Don't be rude.

1111
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:21,347
Here we go.
Come here, come here. Excited?

1112
01:18:22,147 --> 01:18:23,382
- Car.
- Yeah.

1113
01:18:26,919 --> 01:18:29,821
- Bernie, how's it going, man?
- Hey, man. How's it going?

1114
01:18:29,823 --> 01:18:31,590
No idea who he is.
Of course.

1115
01:18:47,439 --> 01:18:48,574
Here he is!

1116
01:18:49,007 --> 01:18:50,907
Ladies, Elton.

1117
01:18:50,909 --> 01:18:51,977
- Hey.
- Hey.

1118
01:18:53,011 --> 01:18:54,978
What are you
doing on your own up here?

1119
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,412
Miserable bastard.

1120
01:18:56,414 --> 01:18:58,114
You're missing
all the fun downstairs.

1121
01:18:58,116 --> 01:19:00,015
Well, as long as all the fun
isn't missing me,

1122
01:19:00,017 --> 01:19:01,886
then who gives a shit, Bernie?

1123
01:19:05,591 --> 01:19:06,625
We should get a drink.

1124
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:10,360
- No, we should. Let's go get a drink.
- Come on, it's fine.

1125
01:19:10,362 --> 01:19:12,962
No, we absolutely should.
No, I'm telling you...

1126
01:19:12,964 --> 01:19:15,501
Yeah, go and get
a little drink.

1127
01:19:48,266 --> 01:19:50,199
You look amazing.

1128
01:19:50,201 --> 01:19:52,769
Fucking prick.

1129
01:20:04,949 --> 01:20:07,084

01:20:09,253 --> 01:20:11,222

- Elton.
- Yes, sorry. You were saying?

1164
01:24:46,996 --> 01:24:49,666
I was saying
that I think I need a break.

1165
01:24:49,999 --> 01:24:52,200
You need to take a break?

1166
01:24:52,202 --> 01:24:55,738
I think that I just need
to go and sort myself out a bit.

1167
01:24:58,207 --> 01:24:59,406
What?

1168
01:24:59,408 --> 01:25:02,978
I'm going home... for a while.

1169
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:05,013
Well, that's nice for you.

1170
01:25:05,447 --> 01:25:09,618
Why can't we just, you know,
both of us just disappear together?

My ranch.

1172
01:25:14,256 --> 01:25:16,159
We'll go to my ranch,
we'll hide away.

1173
01:25:16,391 --> 01:25:18,494
We can write like we did.

1174
01:25:20,195 --> 01:25:21,697
Like we used to.

1175
01:25:22,531 --> 01:25:25,033
We should go home, Elton.

1176
01:25:26,168 --> 01:25:27,503
Reconnect.

1177
01:25:32,341 --> 01:25:33,642
No, you should go.

1178
01:25:35,078 --> 01:25:37,713
There are other writers
I'd like to work with anyway.

1179
01:25:38,614 --> 01:25:42,018
Do me good.
Collaborate with other people.

1180
01:25:43,551 --> 01:25:45,053
I think
it's a really good idea.

Well, if you don't like it, go home.

1186
01:26:29,299 --> 01:26:31,797
It's what everyone else
seems to be doing at the moment.

01:29:29,676 --> 01:29:31,911
Why don't you get back in
the studio you're paying for?

1223
01:29:33,314 --> 01:29:36,984
Why don't you sell my fucking records?
What's this? Hmm?

1224
01:29:37,517 --> 01:29:39,218
Number 11 in Italy.

1225
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:41,519

that's the problem.

01:29:41,521 --> 01:29:43,321
The record's
coked-out MOR shit.

1227
01:29:43,323 --> 01:29:44,324
No, the problem...

1228
01:29:44,891 --> 01:29:48,962
is you have
never understood me...

1229
01:29:49,529 --> 01:29:51,231
and what I have to go through.

1230
01:29:51,564 --> 01:29:53,731
And you know what?
I should've sacked you when you left me.

1231
01:29:53,733 --> 01:29:56,868
I am glad I left you.
It means I can maintain some objectivity

1232
01:29:56,870 --> 01:29:59,537
in your self-indulgent,
myopic little world.

1233

1234
01:30:02,343 --> 01:30:03,576
I don't care.

1235

when your money runs out.

1236

In fact, take me to court.

1237
01:30:17,023 --> 01:30:19,225
You signed contracts
with me years ago.

1238
01:30:19,493 --> 01:30:23,330
So I'll still be collecting my 20%
long after you've killed yourself.

1239
01:30:24,564 --> 01:30:26,467

Renate didn't deserve that.

She's a good person.

- Hello, Mum.

1286
01:35:21,292 --> 01:35:23,858
- Sir, would you like me to...
- Maybe a bit later, thank you.

1287
01:35:23,860 --> 01:35:25,329
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, son.

1288
01:35:25,862 --> 01:35:27,096
- You all right?
- Yeah. Good.

1289
01:35:27,098 --> 01:35:29,900
Just talking about poor Renate.

1290
01:35:30,768 --> 01:35:32,103
Such a lovely woman.

1291
01:35:32,403 --> 01:35:34,605
Divorce can be so painful.

1292
01:35:35,439 --> 01:35:38,040
- Yeah.
- Anyway, celebration is in order.

1293
01:35:39,977 --> 01:35:44,011
We found a lovely villa
by the sea.

1294
01:35:44,013 --> 01:35:45,681
It'd be good if you would
talk to John today,

1295
01:35:45,683 --> 01:35:48,584
get the money arranged.
Can't risk losing this one.

1296
01:35:48,586 --> 01:35:50,152
Yeah, in Minorca.

1297
01:35:50,154 --> 01:35:51,453
It is a lovely place.
You should see it.

1298
01:35:51,455 --> 01:35:53,657
- Minorca, eh?
- Mmm.

1299
01:35:55,826 --> 01:35:57,495
What do you want
to go there for?

1300
01:35:57,995 --> 01:36:00,028
- Because you're driving me away.
- Mmm.

1301
01:36:00,030 --> 01:36:01,997
Every time
we open a paper,

1302
01:36:01,999 --> 01:36:04,935
there's something about you and
the booze or the drugs, and...

1303
01:36:05,704 --> 01:36:07,703
you're breaking
your poor mum's heart.

1304
01:36:07,705 --> 01:36:09,705
Tell you what,
I'll write you a check. Hmm?

1305
01:36:09,707 --> 01:36:11,372
So she can go buy a new one.

1306
01:36:11,374 --> 01:36:13,744
Typical that you'd say
something like that about me,

1307
01:36:14,077 --> 01:36:16,010
when I've given up
so much for you.

1308
01:36:16,012 --> 01:36:17,713
What have you given up for me?

1309
01:36:17,715 --> 01:36:21,185
Your father... for a start.

1310
01:36:26,023 --> 01:36:28,259
You really are
a heartless monster.

1311
01:36:32,629 --> 01:36:35,165
You know, I don't live my life
in black and white.

1312
01:36:36,834 --> 01:36:40,471
And I do not want your fucked-up,
frigid ideas about anything.

1313
01:36:44,274 --> 01:36:46,742
You know, I am so sick

1314
01:36:46,744 --> 01:36:48,512
of running away from who I am.

1315
01:36:50,714 --> 01:36:53,882
There's nothing wrong
with success. Or pleasure.

1316
01:36:53,884 --> 01:36:55,249
In fact,
why am I apologizing for it?

1317
01:36:55,251 --> 01:36:57,720
Mum, I have fucked
everything that moves.

1318
01:36:59,322 --> 01:37:02,123
And I've taken
every drug known to man.

1319
01:37:02,125 --> 01:37:03,359
All of them.

1320
01:37:04,695 --> 01:37:05,729
Do you know what?

1321
01:37:07,631 --> 01:37:09,399
I enjoyed
every last minute of it.

1322
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:12,568
Ever since you first dangled
your fat little legs

1323
01:37:12,570 --> 01:37:14,438
in front of a piano,
you've been lucky.

1324
01:37:14,971 --> 01:37:18,372
You've never worked hard
for a bloody thing in your life.

1325
01:37:18,374 --> 01:37:20,942
It all just comes to you.
You don't do anything.

1326
01:37:20,944 --> 01:37:22,977
And I'm the one who suffers.

1327
01:37:22,979 --> 01:37:25,213

have had children.

- you weren't there.
- It's not weak to ask for help.

1361
01:39:54,463 --> 01:39:57,599
I have worked my balls off
to get us out of the shit.

1362
01:39:58,433 --> 01:40:01,869
Day in, day out, for years.

1363
01:40:01,871 --> 01:40:04,505
And now it's me that can't
walk down the streets.

1364
01:40:04,507 --> 01:40:07,876
It's me
who doesn't have a life.

1365
01:40:08,677 --> 01:40:11,544
'Cause I don't get to sit
around with my feet on a desk,

1366
01:40:11,546 --> 01:40:13,480
chewing on the end
of a fucking pencil.

1367
01:40:13,482 --> 01:40:15,882
"Write the lyrics, Bernie.
I'll take care of everything else."

1368
01:40:15,884 --> 01:40:17,285
That was a test!

1369
01:40:20,023 --> 01:40:21,156
You should've known.

1370
01:40:21,723 --> 01:40:23,492

1425
01:45:58,424 --> 01:46:02,195
Yeah, but I started
acting like a cunt in 1975.

1426
01:46:04,797 --> 01:46:06,265
I just forgot to stop.

1427
01:46:11,870 --> 01:46:13,505
I do feel ashamed.

1428
01:46:15,774 --> 01:46:19,746
Spent so long feeling resentful
for things that just don't matter.

1429
01:46:26,953 --> 01:46:29,122
Maybe I should've tried
to be more ordinary.

1430
01:46:35,627 --> 01:46:36,862
Hello, Nan.

1431
01:46:37,662 --> 01:46:39,698
You was never ordinary.

1432
01:46:40,699 --> 01:46:41,933
Look at you.

1433
01:46:42,934 --> 01:46:46,205
In here, talking
about your feelings.

1434
01:46:47,006 --> 01:46:48,939
What a waste of time.

1435
01:46:48,941 --> 01:46:51,944
Mum, I know it was never easy.

1436
01:46:52,645 --> 01:46:54,279
And I hope you can forgive me.

1437
01:46:56,081 --> 01:46:58,683
Because I've realized
that's what we need to do now.

1438
01:46:59,785 --> 01:47:01,553
Forgive each other.

1439
01:47:03,456 --> 01:47:05,924
- No, your problem is you're selfish.
- No.

1440
01:47:06,925 --> 01:47:09,295
My problem was I believed
you loved me.

1441
01:47:09,561 --> 01:47:11,195
And you're incapable of it.

1442
01:47:11,197 --> 01:47:12,896
I gave everything
to keep something

1443
01:47:12,898 --> 01:47:14,699
that I never even had
in the first place.

1444
01:47:16,002 --> 01:47:18,804
I always thought you was
an introverted extrovert.

1445
01:47:19,471 --> 01:47:22,874
- A what?
- He's shy. He's always been shy.

1446
01:47:23,275 --> 01:47:24,943
It's all his father's fault.

1447
01:47:25,410 --> 01:47:29,147
Don't blame me.
He'd have been strange, regardless.

1448
01:47:29,748 --> 01:47:32,084
Actually, I think
I'm okay with "strange."

1449
01:47:32,584 --> 01:47:35,188
God. Not him.

1450
01:47:35,421 --> 01:47:37,290
Both of you. Stop.

1451
01:47:37,889 --> 01:47:41,227
I'm not going to allow you to
talk to me like this anymore.

1452
01:47:43,061 --> 01:47:44,930
It's about time you said that.

1453
01:47:49,434 --> 01:47:50,669
Bernie.

1454
01:47:53,705 --> 01:47:55,438
I never told you
how much I need you.

1455
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:57,309
No, no, no, I love you, man.

1456
01:47:59,911 --> 01:48:01,380
Always have, always will.

1457
01:48:02,914 --> 01:48:05,716
You write songs
that millions of people love.

1458
01:48:06,050 --> 01:48:07,519
And that's what's important.

1459
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:10,255
You just need to remember
who you are...

1460
01:48:11,722 --> 01:48:13,024
and be okay with it.

1461
01:48:13,558 --> 01:48:15,327
He doesn't know who he is.

1462
01:48:22,634 --> 01:48:23,935
Yes, I do.

1463
01:48:26,539 --> 01:48:28,306
I'm Elton Hercules John.

1464
01:48:29,907 --> 01:48:31,942
I thought
you were Reggie Dwight.

1465
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:44,823
I haven't been
Reggie Dwight for years.

1466
01:48:59,103 --> 01:49:00,905
When are you going
to hug me?

1467
01:49:34,071 --> 01:49:36,241
Impressed you know
how to use one of those.

1468
01:49:40,844 --> 01:49:42,213
How you doing?

1469
01:49:43,914 --> 01:49:45,015
Good to see you.

1470
01:49:45,482 --> 01:49:48,085
Some days are tougher than
others, but I feel good.

1471
01:49:49,753 --> 01:49:51,255
They got a piano here?

1472
01:49:52,056 --> 01:49:53,889
- You been playing?
- Hmm...

1473
01:49:53,891 --> 01:49:55,357
- No.
- No?

1474
01:49:55,359 --> 01:49:57,462
Not in the right place
for that just now.

1475
01:49:58,530 --> 01:49:59,863
I'm scared, Bernie.

1476
01:50:03,834 --> 01:50:05,337
What if I'm not as good...

1477
01:50:07,904 --> 01:50:09,440
without the drink
and the drugs?

1478
01:50:13,177 --> 01:50:14,878
You know that's not true.

1479
01:50:16,580 --> 01:50:18,513
You're not scared
you're not good without it,

1480
01:50:18,515 --> 01:50:19,850
you're scared to feel again.

1481
01:50:20,451 --> 01:50:23,287
You might be able to lie to
yourself, but you can't lie to me.

1482
01:50:27,791 --> 01:50:29,826
I should be going.

1483
01:50:31,928 --> 01:50:33,163
Don't go.

1484
01:50:35,332 --> 01:50:36,333
Not yet.

1485
01:50:37,034 --> 01:50:38,868
This is the part
you gotta do on your own.

1486
01:50:40,471 --> 01:50:43,007
These... need music.

1487
01:50:53,383 --> 01:50:54,485

1488
01:50:58,921 --> 01:51:00,257
