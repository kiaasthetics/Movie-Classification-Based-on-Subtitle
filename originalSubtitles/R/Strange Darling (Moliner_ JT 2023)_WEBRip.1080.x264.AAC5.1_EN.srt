1
00:00:54,976 --> 00:00:56,616
So, I'm gonna have to ask you a question.

2
00:01:03,084 --> 00:01:04,286
Are you a serial killer?

3
00:11:59,476 --> 00:12:02,811
<i>...the whereabouts
of the Velvet Emerald Cult.</i>

4
00:12:02,945 --> 00:12:04,860
<i>Although skeptics don't
believe it's a real thing,</i>

5
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,880
<i>it is.</i>

6
00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:08,650
<i>But that's for another broadcast.</i>

7
00:12:08,784 --> 00:12:10,085
<i>Today we're gonna talk about</i>

8
00:12:10,219 --> 00:12:12,287
<i>the chilling uncovering of a Bigfoot family</i>

9
00:12:12,422 --> 00:12:14,424
<i>in the forest near his property</i>

10
00:12:14,557 --> 00:12:16,091
<i>and what Mitchell is doing about it.</i>

11
00:12:16,992 --> 00:12:18,293
<i>Pretty serious subject.</i>

12
00:12:19,294 --> 00:12:20,329
<i>Let's jump right in.</i>

13
00:12:20,463 --> 00:12:23,165
<i>Mitchell W. Mahoney, everybody.</i>

14
00:12:23,298 --> 00:12:25,535
<i>- Mitchell, are you there?
- I am. I am.</i>

15
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:27,470
<i>Listening with both ears.</i>

16
00:12:27,604 --> 00:12:29,204
<i>I ain't taking no goddamn...</i>

17
00:12:29,338 --> 00:12:31,441
<i>Oh! Oh!
I must stop you there, sir.</i>

18
00:12:31,574 --> 00:12:33,456
<i>As you know, our number-one
rule is no bad language.</i>

19
00:12:33,476 --> 00:12:34,923
<i>Oh, shit.
Yeah, that's right. I'm sorry.</i>

20
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,513
<i>- Didn't mean it.
- No harm, no foul.</i>

21
00:12:36,645 --> 00:12:38,881
<i>It's an emotional subject.
I understand. Carry on, sir.</i>

22
00:12:39,014 --> 00:12:41,283
<i>So I take a quick shot of Old Grand-Dad</i>

23
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:42,784
<i>and I go out there.</i>

24
00:12:42,918 --> 00:12:45,020
<i>Shotgun cocked.</i>

25
00:12:45,154 --> 00:12:48,657
<i>And the whole time I hear the dogs</i>

26
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:52,060
<i>but when I opened the door to go outside,</i>

27
00:12:52,194 --> 00:12:56,064
<i>it stops.
Real quick like, wild.</i>

28
00:12:56,198 --> 00:12:57,198
Hey. Hey!

29
00:13:11,447 --> 00:13:12,649
Can you help me? Please?

30
00:13:29,131 --> 00:13:30,832
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

31
00:13:38,207 --> 00:13:39,708
<i>Which really upset me</i>

32
00:13:39,841 --> 00:13:41,601
<i>because we were gonna butcher it next month.</i>

33
00:13:41,644 --> 00:13:42,924
<i>Now the whole thing's gone away.</i>

34
00:13:43,045 --> 00:13:44,246
<i>I can't hear that.</i>

35
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:46,348
<i>But the worst part was,</i>

36
00:13:46,482 --> 00:13:48,717
<i>the grizzly nature of the whole thing.</i>

37
00:13:57,025 --> 00:13:59,127
<i>Yeah. There you go. It's nomenclature.</i>

38
00:13:59,261 --> 00:14:01,564
<i>What if it attacked me?</i>

39
00:14:01,698 --> 00:14:04,099
<i>All her innards were taken out and eaten.</i>

40
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:08,971
<i>Whatever it was, it's a
loose sack of flesh and fur.</i>

41
00:14:09,104 --> 00:14:10,739
<i>At first I thought it would be gray.</i>

42
00:14:10,872 --> 00:14:12,975
<i>We've had them here before too.</i>

43
00:14:13,108 --> 00:14:15,612
<i>Just to clarify for our listeners,</i>

44
00:14:15,744 --> 00:14:18,581
<i>Mitchell was just referring to
extra-terrestrial entities.</i>

45
00:14:20,048 --> 00:14:22,418
<i>Yeah.
Yeah, thanks, Art.</i>

46
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:44,973
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

47
00:15:14,936 --> 00:15:18,373
<i>...went
to Nova Scotia in 1972,</i>

48
00:15:18,508 --> 00:15:22,144
<i>down in Breckenridge, Colorado in 1987.</i>

49
00:15:22,277 --> 00:15:26,848
<i>Yet again, Moran County back in 2013.</i>

50
00:15:26,982 --> 00:15:29,951
<i>I'm very familiar with the
anatomy of those things.</i>

51
00:15:30,085 --> 00:15:32,655
<i>And even just seeing the
outline in the moonlight,</i>

52
00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:34,691
<i>I knew immediately what it was.</i>

53
00:15:34,823 --> 00:15:36,358
<i>Of course. Of course.</i>

54
00:15:36,492 --> 00:15:39,861
<i>And was that the extent of it,
or have you continued to be...</i>

55
00:15:39,995 --> 00:15:42,164
<i>pestered, for lack of a better word?</i>

56
00:15:42,297 --> 00:15:46,968
<i>No. No.
They keep coming.</i>

57
00:15:47,102 --> 00:15:48,651
<i>They've been eating my hens one by one...</i>

58
00:15:48,671 --> 00:15:50,172
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!

59
00:15:55,678 --> 00:15:56,978
Fuck!

60
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:34,537
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

61
00:19:37,332 --> 00:19:39,435
These aren't the same.

62
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:41,437
Mmm-mmm. Probably better
for you, though.

63
00:19:41,571 --> 00:19:43,806
Mmm... Doubt that.

64
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,182
I even smoked one of yours tonight.

65
00:19:56,953 --> 00:19:57,954
But first...

66
00:20:13,268 --> 00:20:14,369
A-plus.

67
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:20,810
- That's a relief.
- Yes, it is.

68
00:20:23,045 --> 00:20:24,780
Do you still want to, um,

69
00:20:26,649 --> 00:20:28,050
get a room?

70
00:20:29,051 --> 00:20:30,820
Can we just, uh,

71
00:20:33,388 --> 00:20:35,057
make out a little bit?

72
00:20:36,425 --> 00:20:37,425
Yeah.

73
00:20:38,494 --> 00:20:39,494
Okay.

74
00:20:57,913 --> 00:21:00,281
Look, we can just...

75
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,451
We can just swap numbers
if you don't wanna...

76
00:21:02,585 --> 00:21:05,855
Well, okay.
You wanna get...

77
00:21:05,988 --> 00:21:07,123
You wanna get digits?

78
00:21:10,626 --> 00:21:12,895
Nobody gets digits anymore.
It's about the Insta.

79
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:15,498
I guess I'm just getting old.

80
00:21:15,631 --> 00:21:17,133
Well, you are.

81
00:21:19,135 --> 00:21:20,469
I guess that's what I'm into.

82
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,889
This is gonna sound
like bullshit, but, uh...

83
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:45,061
I don't really do this.

84
00:21:46,495 --> 00:21:48,564
I mean, I have no problem doing it.

85
00:21:48,698 --> 00:21:50,499
I...

86
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:52,034
I just have to really want it.

87
00:21:54,804 --> 00:21:57,406
Do you want it?

88
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,408
Or are you, like, about to

89
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:01,711
tell me to go fuck myself?

90
00:22:01,844 --> 00:22:03,412
No, no, I really want it.

91
00:22:03,546 --> 00:22:06,015
I just... I... I like...

92
00:22:08,316 --> 00:22:09,952
sobered up a little bit on the ride over

93
00:22:10,086 --> 00:22:12,054
and started judging myself, I guess.

94
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,892
Look, my groceries are on one shelf.

95
00:22:17,026 --> 00:22:18,746
Hers are on the other.
You know what I mean?

96
00:22:18,828 --> 00:22:21,063
If I cared, I would've said
something at the bar.

97
00:22:21,197 --> 00:22:23,933
And if she cared,
I wouldn't fucking be here.

98
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:26,234
Your...

99
00:22:26,367 --> 00:22:28,336
Your business is not my business.

100
00:22:30,906 --> 00:22:34,076
What this is here, it's recreation.

101
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,544
And I fucking deserve it.

102
00:22:42,618 --> 00:22:43,618
Hell, yeah.

103
00:22:46,555 --> 00:22:49,357
Okay.

104
00:22:53,963 --> 00:22:54,964
Mmm.

105
00:22:55,765 --> 00:22:56,966
It's garbage.

106
00:23:03,706 --> 00:23:04,707
Mmm.

107
00:23:08,944 --> 00:23:09,945
Yeah.

108
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:18,453
Ooh.

109
00:23:19,455 --> 00:23:20,455
You know...

110
00:23:27,062 --> 00:23:29,465
The real issue is safety.

111
00:23:29,598 --> 00:23:31,078
Once I'm alone with you in that room,

112
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:33,502
it's just us, no witnesses.

113
00:23:33,636 --> 00:23:35,156
Do you have any idea the kind of risks

114
00:23:35,237 --> 00:23:36,517
a woman like me takes every time

115
00:23:36,605 --> 00:23:38,641
she agrees to have a little bit of fun?

116
00:23:42,778 --> 00:23:44,113
It's a goddamn tragedy.

117
00:23:46,314 --> 00:23:49,451
Men think that we're these prudes

118
00:23:49,585 --> 00:23:51,187
who don't like casual sex.

119
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:53,321
Most of us fucking love casual sex.

120
00:23:53,455 --> 00:23:54,735
We just want to know that murder

121
00:23:54,824 --> 00:23:56,324
isn't gonna be served on the side.

122
00:23:58,961 --> 00:23:59,962
Jesus.

123
00:24:01,329 --> 00:24:02,898
Never thought about it that way.

124
00:24:03,032 --> 00:24:04,033
Of course you haven't.

125
00:24:06,001 --> 00:24:07,001
You're not a woman.

126
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,308
Then there's, you know,

127
00:24:12,441 --> 00:24:13,761
plain old risk of disappointment,

128
00:24:13,876 --> 00:24:15,544
which is the most common, but...

129
00:24:19,315 --> 00:24:20,315
violence...

130
00:24:22,284 --> 00:24:23,319
That's no joke.

131
00:24:25,554 --> 00:24:26,822
That's life or death.

132
00:24:42,238 --> 00:24:44,372
I think I, um...

133
00:24:44,506 --> 00:24:45,975
I think I want one of those now.

134
00:24:53,482 --> 00:24:54,482
Mmm.

135
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:05,227
You seem like a nice guy.

136
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:09,098
You do.

137
00:25:11,533 --> 00:25:12,902
But you never really know.

138
00:25:15,704 --> 00:25:17,344
So, I'm gonna have to ask you a question.

139
00:25:24,213 --> 00:25:25,347
Are you a serial killer?

140
00:25:26,115 --> 00:25:28,417
What?

141
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,219
I'm gonna need you to look me in the eyes

142
00:25:30,352 --> 00:25:33,222
and give me a serious answer.

143
00:25:37,726 --> 00:25:38,726
No.

144
00:25:42,965 --> 00:25:44,800
- No...
- No.

145
00:25:45,601 --> 00:25:46,635
What?

146
00:25:46,769 --> 00:25:48,405
No, I'm not...

147
00:25:50,906 --> 00:25:52,274
a serial killer.

148
00:26:01,283 --> 00:26:02,384
Okay.

149
00:26:06,455 --> 00:26:07,589
Okay.

150
00:26:15,464 --> 00:26:16,645
Now can we talk about all the things

151
00:26:16,665 --> 00:26:17,733
I want you to do to me?

152
00:26:42,758 --> 00:26:43,758
Harder.

153
00:26:55,804 --> 00:26:56,805
Harder.

154
00:27:05,781 --> 00:27:06,781
Stop.

155
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:16,992
Can you take these off me?

156
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,512
I don't know why this isn't working.

157
00:28:17,386 --> 00:28:18,555
It's your idea.

158
00:28:28,565 --> 00:28:29,631
Maybe it's you.

159
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,903
What did you just say?

160
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,745
Maybe I just don't need it with you.

161
00:28:46,081 --> 00:28:48,350
Well...

162
00:28:48,485 --> 00:28:51,753
Well, look, maybe it's better
that we don't need that

163
00:28:54,289 --> 00:28:55,290
in the beginning.

164
00:29:01,063 --> 00:29:02,164
"The beginning."

165
00:29:06,603 --> 00:29:08,036
If I didn't know any better,

166
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,250
I'd think you were on the
verge of asking for digits.

167
00:29:13,976 --> 00:29:14,776
What are they?

168
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:15,944
Hmm.

169
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,882
Stop.

170
00:29:20,015 --> 00:29:21,950
- Or social media?
- I'm not on social media.

171
00:29:23,152 --> 00:29:25,020
See...

172
00:29:25,154 --> 00:29:26,955
That makes me really want that number.

173
00:29:29,526 --> 00:29:33,429
This just got really fucking complicated.

174
00:30:06,361 --> 00:30:07,664
Well, aren't you eager?

175
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,900
Hmm?

176
00:30:21,176 --> 00:30:22,176
Hmm.

177
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:45,833
What are you doing?

178
00:30:48,705 --> 00:30:49,705
Do you like that?

179
00:30:51,073 --> 00:30:52,073
Stop.

180
00:30:52,709 --> 00:30:55,110
Okay, baby.

181
00:30:55,244 --> 00:30:56,659
- Can you just wait a minute?
- I don't want to wait.

182
00:30:56,679 --> 00:30:58,548
I said I need a fucking minute!

183
00:31:15,364 --> 00:31:16,633
What are you doing?

184
00:31:23,606 --> 00:31:27,242
Take these off me now.

185
00:31:27,376 --> 00:31:28,777
You don't get to decide.

186
00:31:29,712 --> 00:31:32,147
Yes, I do get to decide.

187
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:35,250
Just because I asked you to cuff me at first

188
00:31:35,384 --> 00:31:37,453
doesn't mean that
you don't need my permission.

189
00:31:37,587 --> 00:31:38,755
Wrong.

190
00:31:41,557 --> 00:31:43,292
Get off of me, motherfucker!

191
00:31:48,598 --> 00:31:50,832
You don't fucking hit me!

192
00:31:50,966 --> 00:31:54,737
"Please don't
fucking hit me, sir."

193
00:31:56,805 --> 00:31:58,608
From now on, you only refer to me as sir.

194
00:31:58,741 --> 00:31:59,841
Do you understand me?

195
00:32:00,743 --> 00:32:01,744
Stop it!

196
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,255
I'm in control.

197
00:32:16,325 --> 00:32:17,760
Now here's what's gonna happen.

198
00:32:20,663 --> 00:32:22,364
Please don't kill me.

199
00:32:28,604 --> 00:32:33,175
First, you're gonna take
my foot in your mouth.

200
00:32:33,308 --> 00:32:35,143
Toes first, all the way to the fucking heel.

201
00:32:37,112 --> 00:32:39,749
You don't get to make noise!
You just shut the fuck up!

202
00:32:52,961 --> 00:32:54,396
You're a sick woman.

203
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:01,471
Carrying around shackles
trying to get fucked.

204
00:33:05,742 --> 00:33:07,543
You know you asked for this, right?

205
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,748
Yes.

206
00:33:13,215 --> 00:33:14,215
Yes, what?

207
00:33:16,985 --> 00:33:18,920
Yes, sir.

208
00:33:23,726 --> 00:33:26,161
I'm gonna take my knife
and I'm gonna cut you.

209
00:33:28,163 --> 00:33:30,966
From one set of lips to the other.

210
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:33,068
Watch you bleed to death.

211
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:44,881
Mr. Snuffleupagus!

212
00:33:45,013 --> 00:33:46,749
I can't believe that you're into this.

213
00:33:48,016 --> 00:33:50,152
Just relax, okay.

214
00:33:50,285 --> 00:33:53,756
I don't know if I'm into it,
but I'm willing to try.

215
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,558
No, no, no.
I'm gonna have to believe you,

216
00:33:55,691 --> 00:33:58,428
or it's gonna be a huge,
huge fucking turn off.

217
00:34:02,097 --> 00:34:03,697
I mean, I did do a little bit of acting.

218
00:34:04,534 --> 00:34:05,735
What?

219
00:34:05,868 --> 00:34:08,438
I was in a Holiday Inn Express
commercial once.

220
00:34:08,571 --> 00:34:09,571
What?

221
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,109
So you might actually be good at this.

222
00:34:14,242 --> 00:34:16,077
Look, hawking the free hot breakfast

223
00:34:16,211 --> 00:34:17,979
ain't the same as slapping a woman around,

224
00:34:18,113 --> 00:34:20,128
telling her you're gonna
chop her up into little pieces.

225
00:34:20,148 --> 00:34:22,518
But look, I'm willing to try.

226
00:34:22,652 --> 00:34:23,800
No, no, I don't want any chopping.

227
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,986
I want something intimate.

228
00:34:25,954 --> 00:34:28,825
Something romantic.

229
00:34:30,593 --> 00:34:31,661
Like a slit throat.

230
00:34:33,962 --> 00:34:34,962
Uh...

231
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:40,670
You know you're a little fucked up?

232
00:34:48,143 --> 00:34:50,383
You know you men will do
just about anything to get laid?

233
00:34:50,513 --> 00:34:51,881
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Huh?

234
00:34:52,013 --> 00:34:54,450
Get the fuck out of here with that.

235
00:34:54,584 --> 00:34:57,285
Don't sell me the car and
then tell me not to drive it.

236
00:35:01,824 --> 00:35:03,291
Okay, okay. But...

237
00:35:05,862 --> 00:35:08,798
Don't tell me when you're
gonna turn, you just do it.

238
00:35:08,931 --> 00:35:10,833
And if I say no, you say yes.

239
00:35:10,967 --> 00:35:14,002
And you push even harder.

240
00:35:14,135 --> 00:35:16,772
If I'm, you know, scared or angry.

241
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:19,809
Even fucking crying.

242
00:35:19,942 --> 00:35:20,977
I don't...

243
00:35:23,646 --> 00:35:24,714
I don't like that.

244
00:35:25,882 --> 00:35:27,215
Don't be a fucking pussy.

245
00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:29,150
Are you serious?

246
00:35:29,284 --> 00:35:32,354
I cannot imagine consent
being any more clear.

247
00:35:36,459 --> 00:35:37,460
Okay.

248
00:35:38,694 --> 00:35:39,695
All right.

249
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,801
Yes.

250
00:35:58,748 --> 00:35:59,749
Pop quiz.

251
00:36:01,684 --> 00:36:02,818
What's "no" mean?

252
00:36:06,087 --> 00:36:07,590
Yes.

253
00:36:07,723 --> 00:36:10,960
And what is the only word
in the entire English language

254
00:36:11,092 --> 00:36:12,862
that actually means no

255
00:36:12,995 --> 00:36:14,997
once we're alone together in that room?

256
00:36:18,534 --> 00:36:19,735
Mr. Snuffleupagus.

257
00:36:19,869 --> 00:36:21,571
Mr. Snuffleupagus!

258
00:36:24,272 --> 00:36:25,272
You okay?

259
00:36:25,675 --> 00:36:26,943
Not really.

260
00:36:28,176 --> 00:36:29,176
Shit.

261
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,380
I'm so sorry.

262
00:36:39,722 --> 00:36:40,756
How can you say

263
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,959
those awful things to me?

264
00:36:48,396 --> 00:36:49,832
Fuck! You told...

265
00:36:49,966 --> 00:36:51,467
You told me to say 'em.
I thought...

266
00:36:55,236 --> 00:36:58,306
You were fucking fantastic.

267
00:36:58,441 --> 00:37:00,241
I have never been so turned on in my life.

268
00:37:02,377 --> 00:37:03,378
Mmm!

269
00:37:06,415 --> 00:37:07,416
Mmm.

270
00:37:08,484 --> 00:37:10,486
Then why Mr. Snuffleupagus?

271
00:37:13,656 --> 00:37:16,058
I just needed a break.

272
00:37:17,093 --> 00:37:20,062
You know, a glass of water,

273
00:37:21,797 --> 00:37:24,165
maybe a cigarette, a drink.

274
00:37:26,234 --> 00:37:27,770
There's no rush, right?

275
00:38:08,477 --> 00:38:09,478
Hmm...

276
00:39:42,738 --> 00:39:43,739
Bon appetit.

277
00:39:51,881 --> 00:39:52,915
Mmm.

278
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,118
Mmm-hmm.

279
00:39:59,421 --> 00:40:01,389
Mmm, mmm.

280
00:40:09,765 --> 00:40:11,033
What do you got?

281
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:13,334
You're three ahead of me.

282
00:40:13,469 --> 00:40:15,417
Looks like you've got that one
ready to go for the nose.

283
00:40:15,437 --> 00:40:17,506
Stop.

284
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,441
I don't need you
to help me win. Goddamn it.

285
00:40:19,575 --> 00:40:21,110
I want this thing fair and square.

286
00:40:22,678 --> 00:40:23,679
Now only two.

287
00:40:28,517 --> 00:40:30,252
Oh, my...

288
00:40:32,288 --> 00:40:34,890
Don't get too excited.
I'm still up by one.

289
00:40:35,024 --> 00:40:36,292
Not for long, fucker.

290
00:40:36,425 --> 00:40:37,793
Hey, hey!

291
00:40:38,828 --> 00:40:41,630
Hey, hey! Hey!

292
00:40:48,537 --> 00:40:50,005
That's a crazy lady.

293
00:40:50,139 --> 00:40:51,173
Get the bear spray.

294
00:40:59,014 --> 00:41:00,115
Can you help me? Please?

295
00:41:05,454 --> 00:41:07,723
You sure it wasn't one of
'em things done this to you?

296
00:41:07,857 --> 00:41:09,458
Shh.
Don't say it out loud.

297
00:41:10,526 --> 00:41:11,526
What things?

298
00:41:13,028 --> 00:41:14,196
It's Squatchy in those woods.

299
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:15,898
We don't go too deep in 'em.

300
00:41:16,031 --> 00:41:17,733
Squatchy?

301
00:41:17,867 --> 00:41:20,035
- You're sure it was a man did this to you?
- Yes.

302
00:41:20,169 --> 00:41:22,504
- He was chasing me in a truck.
- A pickup truck?

303
00:41:22,638 --> 00:41:24,573
Squatch can't drive no pickup truck.

304
00:41:24,707 --> 00:41:27,543
You'd be one dead shitass
if Squatch was at it.

305
00:41:27,676 --> 00:41:28,677
Do you have a gun?

306
00:41:28,811 --> 00:41:29,879
We have bear spray.

307
00:41:30,012 --> 00:41:32,114
I thought mountain people had guns.

308
00:41:32,248 --> 00:41:33,582
We ain't mountain people.

309
00:41:33,716 --> 00:41:35,251
We're just old hippies.

310
00:41:40,923 --> 00:41:43,926
Sweetie, do you want something
for the pain? Aspirin?

311
00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:45,307
How about something a little bit stronger?

312
00:41:45,327 --> 00:41:46,762
- Percocet?
- Yes.

313
00:41:46,896 --> 00:41:48,697
We only have a few of those left.

314
00:41:48,831 --> 00:41:49,951
Now, don't be selfish, Mama.

315
00:41:50,065 --> 00:41:51,065
You're right, Papa.

316
00:41:52,601 --> 00:41:53,601
Call the cops.

317
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:56,238
Better they're on the way.

318
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,208
What's that?

319
00:41:59,341 --> 00:42:02,077
Oh, we ain't into Scott Baio.

320
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:03,726
They give 'em away free at the flea market.

321
00:42:03,746 --> 00:42:06,081
- We take whatever they got.
- No. What's that?

322
00:42:06,215 --> 00:42:07,975
- That's our Sunday breakfast.
- Do you mind?

323
00:42:08,384 --> 00:42:09,385
Get in there.

324
00:42:09,518 --> 00:42:11,387
Hold on.
Let me give you a chair.

325
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,800
- Right here. Right here.
- Okay.

326
00:42:17,293 --> 00:42:18,293
Old biker.

327
00:42:19,194 --> 00:42:20,829
Huh?

328
00:42:20,963 --> 00:42:23,632
She said we're old hippies.
I'm more of an old biker.

329
00:42:23,766 --> 00:42:25,901
Got a '59 Indian sitting in the garage.

330
00:42:26,035 --> 00:42:27,384
Doesn't run anymore, but doesn't matter.

331
00:42:27,404 --> 00:42:29,204
I couldn't ride it anyway.

332
00:42:31,907 --> 00:42:33,575
Lost it on the bike.

333
00:42:33,709 --> 00:42:36,245
Whole thing? That's heavy.

334
00:42:36,378 --> 00:42:37,378
Just up to the knee.

335
00:42:37,479 --> 00:42:38,781
You ride one of those every day,

336
00:42:38,914 --> 00:42:40,449
doesn't matter how good you are.

337
00:42:40,582 --> 00:42:42,451
It doesn't matter.

338
00:42:42,584 --> 00:42:44,954
Can't find the stronger stuff. Where is it?

339
00:42:45,087 --> 00:42:46,655
Upstairs bathroom.

340
00:42:46,789 --> 00:42:48,457
Police on the way?

341
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:49,959
Yes, honey.

342
00:42:50,092 --> 00:42:51,092
No.

343
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,461
Don't you worry one bit.

344
00:42:52,594 --> 00:42:54,163
You're gonna feel real nice soon.

345
00:42:54,296 --> 00:42:56,165
I meant no police.

346
00:42:56,298 --> 00:42:58,480
No, no. It's better that we
call them. Genevieve's right.

347
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,869
Come on, man.
Just give it a minute, please.

348
00:43:01,003 --> 00:43:02,571
It's best we let them know.

349
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:06,175
Please, man, do me this favor.
No fucking cops.

350
00:43:51,186 --> 00:43:53,389
Genevieve. Genevieve.

351
00:43:55,024 --> 00:43:56,024
Genevieve.

352
00:44:02,798 --> 00:44:04,033
Percocet...

353
00:44:06,001 --> 00:44:07,001
Genevieve...

354
00:44:14,243 --> 00:44:16,945
I didn't wanna do that.
I had to.

355
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:20,282
Can you just... Can you
put your hands up, please?

356
00:44:20,417 --> 00:44:22,317
Just to make us both feel more relaxed.

357
00:44:26,822 --> 00:44:28,804
This is gonna be a really
tough one for you to believe,

358
00:44:28,824 --> 00:44:31,160
but I'm not gonna kill you.

359
00:44:32,529 --> 00:44:33,529
I promise.

360
00:44:35,364 --> 00:44:37,066
Sure.

361
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:39,119
I am gonna have to tie
you up, though. All right?

362
00:44:41,603 --> 00:44:42,638
All right.

363
00:44:42,771 --> 00:44:44,251
What do you recommend that's fastest?

364
00:44:45,607 --> 00:44:48,210
You have some... some cuffs?

365
00:44:48,343 --> 00:44:51,481
Or is there a rope or...
Or is there something

366
00:44:51,613 --> 00:44:53,615
that I can put you in
and lock it from the outside?

367
00:44:53,749 --> 00:44:55,364
Whatever is most comfortable for you is fine

368
00:44:55,384 --> 00:44:56,752
as long as it's fast.

369
00:44:56,885 --> 00:44:58,421
Well, that's thoughtful of you.

370
00:44:58,555 --> 00:44:59,768
I'm not trying to fuck up your day

371
00:44:59,788 --> 00:45:01,491
any more than I already have.

372
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,426
There's a storm shelter
outside. There's...

373
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:08,330
There's some, um, chain

374
00:45:08,465 --> 00:45:13,068
you can use on the handles once I'm in.

375
00:45:13,202 --> 00:45:15,572
And we even got food and such
that'll last a while.

376
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:20,443
We aren't just old hippies.

377
00:45:20,577 --> 00:45:21,578
We're...

378
00:45:23,378 --> 00:45:24,581
Doomsdayers.

379
00:45:25,247 --> 00:45:26,381
Okay, let's go.

380
00:46:55,204 --> 00:46:56,204
Fuck!

381
00:47:56,633 --> 00:47:57,634
What?

382
00:48:01,069 --> 00:48:03,305
What? Something on my face?

383
00:48:03,439 --> 00:48:04,540
Like, what?

384
00:48:09,978 --> 00:48:13,750
I was just looking at you

385
00:48:13,882 --> 00:48:17,720
and you are so handsome.

386
00:48:18,721 --> 00:48:20,322
It went straight to my head.

387
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,095
How did I get so lucky tonight?

388
00:48:38,508 --> 00:48:39,908
Do you like to party?

389
00:48:54,323 --> 00:48:56,391
Oh, fuck.

390
00:48:56,526 --> 00:48:58,561
It's going to be light soon.

391
00:48:58,695 --> 00:49:01,531
Mmm. Come on.

392
00:49:01,664 --> 00:49:03,766
Checkout's not until noon and this stuff

393
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:10,773
gets me really fucking horny.

394
00:49:13,509 --> 00:49:16,211
It's been a long time
since I touched that stuff.

395
00:49:17,212 --> 00:49:18,212
Me too.

396
00:49:21,684 --> 00:49:22,719
But it's my birthday.

397
00:49:24,721 --> 00:49:25,722
And...

398
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:29,826
a friend got it for me.

399
00:49:29,958 --> 00:49:32,078
It's, you know, like a
special occasion sort of thing.

400
00:49:37,165 --> 00:49:38,501
Birthday, huh?

401
00:49:38,634 --> 00:49:39,836
Yeah.

402
00:49:43,806 --> 00:49:46,409
All right.

403
00:49:46,542 --> 00:49:50,680
Well, I can't let a lady down
on her birthday now, can I?

404
00:49:54,751 --> 00:49:56,084
Oh, yeah.

405
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:36,390
Come on.

406
00:50:37,259 --> 00:50:38,260
Come on.

407
00:50:39,429 --> 00:50:40,429
Shit.

408
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:18,359
Are we...

409
00:52:21,531 --> 00:52:22,565
Are we...

410
00:52:24,299 --> 00:52:29,170
Are we gonna fuck?

411
00:52:29,304 --> 00:52:30,840
Okay.

412
00:52:30,973 --> 00:52:32,253
Is that what you were gonna say?

413
00:52:38,179 --> 00:52:40,081
You know what, I'll tell you what.

414
00:52:40,215 --> 00:52:43,719
If you still can fuck in five minutes...

415
00:52:45,353 --> 00:52:46,353
Sure.

416
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:55,790
I thought you said
this stuff made you horny.

417
00:52:55,831 --> 00:52:58,066
Seems like it just puts you in a bad mood.

418
00:52:58,199 --> 00:52:59,267
Maybe I lied.

419
00:53:05,408 --> 00:53:06,742
What is this, part of your game?

420
00:53:15,751 --> 00:53:17,420
- I'm done.
- You know what?

421
00:53:17,553 --> 00:53:18,701
We're done when I say we're done,

422
00:53:18,721 --> 00:53:19,721
do you understand that?

423
00:53:19,789 --> 00:53:21,958
No, I don't.

424
00:53:26,429 --> 00:53:28,296
I'm out of here.

425
00:53:28,431 --> 00:53:30,600
Bullshit.
Find your own way home.

426
00:55:28,884 --> 00:55:31,954
Cocaine.
Cocaine. Cocaine.

427
00:55:32,088 --> 00:55:33,089
Huh?

428
00:55:33,856 --> 00:55:35,191
Cocaine.

429
00:55:35,356 --> 00:55:37,325
No. No.

430
00:55:38,828 --> 00:55:40,730
That is cocaine.

431
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:48,269
This is ketamine.

432
00:55:52,408 --> 00:55:53,743
No.

433
00:55:58,013 --> 00:56:00,216
I'll only use this if I have to,
so don't make me.

434
00:56:12,293 --> 00:56:14,362
I didn't wanna fucking do this, man.

435
00:56:17,298 --> 00:56:18,534
I was...

436
00:56:20,268 --> 00:56:26,208
just trying to have a good time.

437
00:56:40,923 --> 00:56:42,558
Oh, my God!

438
00:56:44,126 --> 00:56:46,662
I fucking love that song.

439
00:58:03,973 --> 00:58:05,107
Hey!

440
00:58:05,241 --> 00:58:07,743
Shh! Just stop.

441
01:01:00,149 --> 01:01:02,051
I've never put it there before.

442
01:01:20,936 --> 01:01:22,237
Now sleep.

443
01:01:43,926 --> 01:01:45,060
What the fuck?

444
01:01:46,361 --> 01:01:47,361
He's got a gun!

445
01:01:47,464 --> 01:01:48,764
Well so do I!

446
01:02:45,588 --> 01:02:47,256
- What is wrong with you?
- I'm sorry.

447
01:02:51,193 --> 01:02:52,961
Can... Can you help me, please?

448
01:02:53,095 --> 01:02:54,129
Jesus!

449
01:02:54,997 --> 01:02:55,997
Oh, my God.

450
01:03:45,548 --> 01:03:47,450
How do I lock this door?

451
01:03:47,584 --> 01:03:49,384
Just hold on, darling.

452
01:03:49,519 --> 01:03:51,053
It needs a key, even from the inside.

453
01:03:54,657 --> 01:03:56,406
Can you unlock the door?
I think I'd better leave.

454
01:03:56,426 --> 01:03:58,541
No, no, don't go out there!
He's gonna fucking kill you!

455
01:03:58,561 --> 01:03:59,561
Do you have a gun?

456
01:03:59,662 --> 01:04:00,963
No, only a baseball bat.

457
01:04:01,096 --> 01:04:02,264
Fuck!

458
01:04:02,397 --> 01:04:04,099
Call 911, will you?

459
01:04:04,233 --> 01:04:06,368
I... I'm not sure
I wanna get involved.

460
01:04:06,502 --> 01:04:07,622
You already are, sweetheart.

461
01:04:23,553 --> 01:04:26,121
Okay.

462
01:04:26,255 --> 01:04:30,092
I know that was fucking awful,
but I had to do it.

463
01:04:30,225 --> 01:04:31,225
Okay?

464
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:32,860
What's your name?

465
01:04:34,263 --> 01:04:35,531
T... Tanya.

466
01:04:36,798 --> 01:04:37,798
Tanya...

467
01:04:39,067 --> 01:04:40,470
Okay, Tan...

468
01:04:40,603 --> 01:04:42,117
Do you have a bandage big
enough for this in that bag?

469
01:04:42,137 --> 01:04:43,506
Yes.

470
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,874
Okay. I'm gonna need
to borrow your car.

471
01:04:47,976 --> 01:04:50,112
Come on.

472
01:04:50,245 --> 01:04:52,415
- Which fucking key is it?
- It's... It's that one.

473
01:04:52,548 --> 01:04:55,518
- It's that one.
- Okay. What car?

474
01:04:55,652 --> 01:04:58,421
It's the '78 Pinto, right outside.

475
01:04:58,554 --> 01:05:00,255
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

476
01:05:01,457 --> 01:05:02,457
Okay.

477
01:05:03,726 --> 01:05:05,086
Now take off your fucking clothes.

478
01:07:20,962 --> 01:07:22,063
Hey, Pete.

479
01:07:23,433 --> 01:07:25,934
It's, um... It's RC. Um...

480
01:07:27,904 --> 01:07:30,372
Listen, I'm out here near, uh, near SR 78

481
01:07:31,407 --> 01:07:33,341
and the old Wilton Bridge.

482
01:07:33,476 --> 01:07:34,811
There's a farmhouse

483
01:07:36,612 --> 01:07:38,614
on the south edge
near the fire road. I, um...

484
01:07:40,783 --> 01:07:41,918
I need you to get out here.

485
01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:44,854
I, uh...

486
01:07:50,058 --> 01:07:51,894
I got myself into a little bit of trouble.

487
01:08:40,476 --> 01:08:43,946
Got you, you fucking cunt!

488
01:08:47,115 --> 01:08:49,150
I fucking got you.

489
01:08:49,284 --> 01:08:50,318
That's true.

490
01:08:53,623 --> 01:08:54,824
It's like checkmate.

491
01:08:55,958 --> 01:08:56,958
Yeah.

492
01:08:57,527 --> 01:08:58,694
And then some.

493
01:09:01,998 --> 01:09:03,833
There's nothing more than checkmate.

494
01:09:03,966 --> 01:09:06,368
It either is or it isn't,

495
01:09:06,502 --> 01:09:09,872
you fucking philistine.

496
01:09:13,843 --> 01:09:14,843
Why am I still alive?

497
01:09:20,148 --> 01:09:21,148
You couldn't do it.

498
01:09:24,152 --> 01:09:25,153
After all that.

499
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:30,760
Oh.

500
01:09:30,893 --> 01:09:32,394
You're gonna be in trouble.

501
01:09:32,528 --> 01:09:33,896
Yeah, well...

502
01:09:36,566 --> 01:09:37,886
I'll take a little bit of trouble

503
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,535
over a life sentence any day.

504
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:46,842
You want me to call your sponsor?

505
01:09:52,915 --> 01:09:54,584
Are you really The Electric Lady?

506
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:58,119
I don't care about jail.

507
01:10:00,756 --> 01:10:02,190
I just don't wanna die.

508
01:10:03,793 --> 01:10:04,927
Isn't that fucking funny?

509
01:10:08,798 --> 01:10:10,780
Even when we know we're gonna
spend the rest of our lives

510
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,133
in a tiny little cage,

511
01:10:12,267 --> 01:10:15,638
we will fight to stay alive.

512
01:10:19,575 --> 01:10:21,410
I always used to wonder why people did that,

513
01:10:23,913 --> 01:10:26,147
when I watched true crime shows.

514
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:32,822
Thought I'd be like Gary Gilmore.

515
01:10:35,791 --> 01:10:37,059
Who's Gary Gilmore?

516
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:41,229
He asked for the firing squad.

517
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I thought I'd...

518
01:10:47,837 --> 01:10:48,938
I'd do that...

519
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:52,408
if it came to this.

520
01:10:56,612 --> 01:11:03,786
Now I just want three hots and a cot.

521
01:11:03,919 --> 01:11:05,788
I didn't plan to do it, man.

522
01:11:10,459 --> 01:11:11,460
Love...

523
01:11:13,829 --> 01:11:16,098
doesn't have to be something that develops.

524
01:11:20,936 --> 01:11:25,941
The purest, most primal kind
can hit you like a wave...

525
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:28,978
In a moment...

526
01:11:31,881 --> 01:11:33,549
or over the course of one night.

527
01:11:37,318 --> 01:11:38,421
I felt that for you

528
01:11:38,554 --> 01:11:40,623
when you had your hand around my throat.

529
01:11:43,726 --> 01:11:44,727
Did you feel it for me?

530
01:12:13,923 --> 01:12:15,758
That's our song now.

531
01:12:20,096 --> 01:12:22,164
You'll always think of me when you hear it.

532
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:28,904
Maybe.

533
01:12:31,707 --> 01:12:32,742
Not...

534
01:12:34,342 --> 01:12:35,342
maybe.

535
01:12:41,684 --> 01:12:42,818
God! Fuck!

536
01:16:45,594 --> 01:16:46,594
RC!

537
01:16:51,934 --> 01:16:53,802
RC, are you in here?

538
01:17:17,659 --> 01:17:20,129
What the fuck happened in here?

539
01:17:25,834 --> 01:17:26,882
Maybe you shouldn't touch him.

540
01:17:26,902 --> 01:17:28,170
- I know what I'm doing.
- Okay.

541
01:17:30,539 --> 01:17:32,475
It's all right.
It's all right.

542
01:17:34,209 --> 01:17:36,479
- He's dead.
- Yeah, no shit. So is he.

543
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:38,680
It's okay.

544
01:17:38,814 --> 01:17:40,734
All right? Take it easy.
I'm gonna get these off.

545
01:17:40,816 --> 01:17:42,084
What happened here?

546
01:17:42,217 --> 01:17:44,017
What do you think happened,
Pete? Look at her!

547
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:47,656
Here we go. Okay. It's okay.

548
01:17:49,158 --> 01:17:50,726
- Here we go.
- Goddamn it!

549
01:17:50,859 --> 01:17:53,362
Take it easy.
Okay, take it easy.

550
01:17:53,496 --> 01:17:56,865
There's a gunshot wound
to the left shoulder.

551
01:17:56,999 --> 01:17:58,934
Just take it easy, honey.
How tender is it?

552
01:17:59,068 --> 01:18:01,937
Can I move it just a little
to get the cuffs off?

553
01:18:02,071 --> 01:18:04,606
Wait. We need to figure out
what's going on here first.

554
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:06,660
She needs medical attention now.
That's protocol.

555
01:18:06,708 --> 01:18:08,377
Protocol is that we call it in.

556
01:18:08,511 --> 01:18:09,711
Leave her be,

557
01:18:09,845 --> 01:18:12,815
and we wait for the EMTs
and Homicide to show up.

558
01:18:12,948 --> 01:18:14,897
We both know medics won't
be here for at least an hour.

559
01:18:14,917 --> 01:18:16,618
It's okay.
I'm gonna get you out.

560
01:18:16,752 --> 01:18:17,753
Okay.

561
01:18:17,886 --> 01:18:20,255
It was horrible.

562
01:18:21,524 --> 01:18:23,659
He was coked up out of his mind.

563
01:18:23,792 --> 01:18:25,994
I thought he was a nice guy.

564
01:18:26,128 --> 01:18:27,564
Who was coked out of his mind?

565
01:18:30,099 --> 01:18:32,835
His jacket pocket.

566
01:18:32,968 --> 01:18:34,937
It's okay, honey,
you don't need to do this now.

567
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:37,474
He brought me here.
He thought it was deserted.

568
01:18:37,606 --> 01:18:40,809
And then this guy stopped him and...

569
01:18:40,943 --> 01:18:43,413
It's okay, honey.

570
01:18:43,546 --> 01:18:45,247
Why is his neck like that?

571
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:47,700
She was chained to this thing
the whole fucking time, Pete.

572
01:18:47,749 --> 01:18:49,029
She fought for her fucking life!

573
01:18:49,151 --> 01:18:50,471
What else was she supposed to do?

574
01:18:50,553 --> 01:18:52,754
- Fuck! Fuck you!
- Hey, hey, hey!

575
01:18:52,888 --> 01:18:54,823
- Hey, it's okay.
- Okay, okay. All right. Okay.

576
01:18:54,957 --> 01:18:57,359
All right. Hey, calm down, lady.

577
01:18:57,494 --> 01:18:59,394
We're gonna take care of it.

578
01:18:59,529 --> 01:19:00,943
I'm going to the car and call it in,

579
01:19:00,963 --> 01:19:02,532
and then we'll wait here for the EMTs.

580
01:19:02,664 --> 01:19:05,167
The victim needs medical attention.

581
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:07,970
Our job is to do what we
need to do to keep her alive.

582
01:19:08,103 --> 01:19:09,805
This ain't my first jar of pickles.

583
01:19:09,938 --> 01:19:11,588
And just because I have
a vagina doesn't mean

584
01:19:11,608 --> 01:19:13,722
you shouldn't listen to
a fucking thing I have to say!

585
01:19:13,742 --> 01:19:16,044
This has nothing to do with your vagina

586
01:19:16,178 --> 01:19:18,481
and everything to do with
the diapers you were wearing

587
01:19:18,615 --> 01:19:21,183
when I cleared my first crime scene.

588
01:19:21,316 --> 01:19:23,486
We don't even know if she's a victim yet.

589
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:25,120
We need to find that out first.

590
01:19:25,254 --> 01:19:26,655
That's fucking protocol.

591
01:19:30,259 --> 01:19:31,474
You wanna be held liable for this

592
01:19:31,494 --> 01:19:32,774
or you want to help me move her?

593
01:19:34,129 --> 01:19:35,330
Pete!

594
01:19:35,465 --> 01:19:36,999
Okay, I'll help you move her.

595
01:19:43,172 --> 01:19:44,474
It's all right, honey.

596
01:19:44,607 --> 01:19:45,807
Just breathe.

597
01:19:52,649 --> 01:19:53,715
What the fuck?

598
01:20:00,657 --> 01:20:03,392
A lady came, she killed us.

599
01:20:04,793 --> 01:20:06,361
Calm down, ma'am.

600
01:20:06,496 --> 01:20:08,565
- She killed us!
- Who did what?

601
01:20:14,504 --> 01:20:17,072
Hand over the guns now,
or the chick cop dies.

602
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,242
And trust me, honey,

603
01:20:20,375 --> 01:20:22,110
I don't wanna fucking kill you,

604
01:20:22,244 --> 01:20:23,845
especially after what you did for me.

605
01:20:23,979 --> 01:20:25,548
God-fucking-damnit.

606
01:20:27,049 --> 01:20:28,383
You dumb bitch.

607
01:20:29,985 --> 01:20:31,634
- I oughta let her...
- Oh, no, you oughtn't,

608
01:20:31,654 --> 01:20:34,223
'cause if she goes,
you go too, motherfucker.

609
01:20:34,356 --> 01:20:36,626
I am in survival mode now.

610
01:20:36,758 --> 01:20:37,878
My rules are out the window.

611
01:20:37,926 --> 01:20:40,028
Honey, just turn yourself in now...

612
01:20:40,162 --> 01:20:41,564
Just shut up

613
01:20:42,397 --> 01:20:43,666
and give me the guns.

614
01:20:53,342 --> 01:20:54,544
Put it in my lap.

615
01:21:03,252 --> 01:21:06,154
Pete, you keep your hands
on the wheel at all times.

616
01:21:06,288 --> 01:21:08,558
If a fucking finger moves,
I pull the trigger.

617
01:21:08,691 --> 01:21:09,691
You got me?

618
01:21:10,693 --> 01:21:11,728
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

619
01:21:13,095 --> 01:21:15,097
- Get out of the car.
- Honey...

620
01:21:15,230 --> 01:21:17,332
Just turn yourself in now and stop.

621
01:21:17,467 --> 01:21:18,767
It'll end better for you.

622
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:19,900
Bitch!

623
01:21:20,769 --> 01:21:23,573
I am The Electric Lady.

624
01:21:25,974 --> 01:21:27,109
Boo!

625
01:21:29,479 --> 01:21:30,479
Get out the fucking car.

626
01:21:47,162 --> 01:21:50,966
Run, honey, into the woods.

627
01:21:58,073 --> 01:21:59,475
Drive, motherfucker.

628
01:22:23,298 --> 01:22:24,500
Why did we stop here?

629
01:22:28,203 --> 01:22:29,203
Just...

630
01:22:31,474 --> 01:22:32,542
Let me think.

631
01:22:33,676 --> 01:22:34,677
Okay?

632
01:22:37,714 --> 01:22:39,482
Are you really The Electric Lady?

633
01:22:49,492 --> 01:22:50,660
Are you gonna kill me?

634
01:22:56,699 --> 01:22:57,734
I'd rather not.

635
01:23:01,903 --> 01:23:03,539
Why did you kill all those folks?

636
01:23:18,887 --> 01:23:19,887
Sometimes...

637
01:23:22,891 --> 01:23:24,427
I don't see humans.

638
01:23:27,396 --> 01:23:28,831
I see devils.

639
01:25:17,473 --> 01:25:18,473
Hey.

640
01:25:20,041 --> 01:25:21,109
Hey.

641
01:25:23,813 --> 01:25:24,813
Hey!

642
01:25:34,155 --> 01:25:35,725
Can you help me, please?

643
01:25:35,858 --> 01:25:38,528
Oh, sweet girl! What happened?

644
01:25:39,495 --> 01:25:40,897
Oh, God!

645
01:25:41,029 --> 01:25:42,043
Here, let me help you get up.

646
01:25:42,063 --> 01:25:43,799
Oh! Oh, yeah?

647
01:25:46,201 --> 01:25:47,202
Yeah, come on.

648
01:25:49,337 --> 01:25:50,372
Here...

649
01:25:51,807 --> 01:25:53,074
Let's get you in the truck.

650
01:25:59,549 --> 01:26:00,549
Easy does it.

651
01:26:01,651 --> 01:26:03,351
You're gonna be fine.

652
01:26:05,521 --> 01:26:06,889
Here, let me help you up.

653
01:26:15,765 --> 01:26:16,766
Okay.

654
01:27:35,811 --> 01:27:37,980
Hello?
I just shot a person.

655
01:27:39,982 --> 01:27:41,517
She pulled a gun on me

656
01:27:41,651 --> 01:27:43,519
and there was nothing else I could do.

657
01:27:52,094 --> 01:27:53,429
I'm bringing her in right now.

658
01:37:01,843 --> 01:37:04,547
<i>From the high desert
in the majestic American West,</i>

659
01:37:04,681 --> 01:37:06,416
<i>I bid you all good evening.</i>

660
01:37:06,549 --> 01:37:08,518
<i>Or good morning, or good afternoon,</i>

661
01:37:08,651 --> 01:37:12,087
<i>wherever you may be
across this great land of ours.</i>

662
01:37:12,221 --> 01:37:14,923
<i>This is the world famous,</i>

663
01:37:15,057 --> 01:37:16,593
<i>dark night in the desert.</i>

01:37:16,725 --> 01:37:17,993
<i>And I'm Art Pallone.</i>
