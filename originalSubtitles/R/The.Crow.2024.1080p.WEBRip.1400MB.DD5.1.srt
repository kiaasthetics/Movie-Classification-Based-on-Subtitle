1
00:01:17,889 --> 00:01:19,021
No!

2
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,547
Oh!

3
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,396
<i>When someone
you love dies...</i>

4
00:02:08,076 --> 00:02:10,738
<i>...you will know emptiness.</i>

5
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:17,418
<i>You will know what it is
to be completely</i>

6
00:02:18,448 --> 00:02:19,915
<i>and utterly alone.</i>

7
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:25,756
<i>You will never forget...</i>

8
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:31,861
<i>...and you will never...</i>

9
00:02:33,165 --> 00:02:35,799
<i>ever forgive.</i>

10
00:04:11,526 --> 00:04:13,231
- Zadie?
<i>- Shelly.</i>

11
00:04:13,232 --> 00:04:15,200
Did you see what I sent you?

12
00:04:15,201 --> 00:04:17,169
<i>No. What is it?</i>

13
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,303
I showed the video to someone.

14
00:04:19,304 --> 00:04:20,640
I think they found out.

15
00:04:21,506 --> 00:04:23,071
What the fuck is going on?

16
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,480
<i>Check your texts.</i>

17
00:04:31,985 --> 00:04:33,114
<i>Hey, Shelly.</i>

18
00:04:35,826 --> 00:04:37,294
<i>Oh, stop!</i>

19
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:43,894
<i>What the fuck?
What did you do to her?</i>

20
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:48,998
Where did you get this?

21
00:04:49,531 --> 00:04:50,565
Dom shot it.

22
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:52,738
Look, we can get him with this.

23
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:55,172
He's not invincible, Shelly.

24
00:04:55,173 --> 00:04:57,103
Yes, he is.

25
00:04:57,104 --> 00:04:59,811
I'm getting my shit
and getting the fuck out.

26
00:05:01,643 --> 00:05:02,945
Come with me.

27
00:05:02,946 --> 00:05:04,247
You and Dom.

28
00:05:04,248 --> 00:05:05,712
<i>The three of us.</i>

29
00:05:05,713 --> 00:05:07,420
Why the fuck did you do this?

30
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:09,021
It's not safe
for us here anymore.

31
00:05:10,426 --> 00:05:12,074
<i>Stay there.
I'm coming to you.</i>

32
00:05:12,075 --> 00:05:13,723
I think
they've got someone on me.

33
00:05:13,724 --> 00:05:15,425
If they're following me,
they're following you.

34
00:05:15,426 --> 00:05:16,663
Hello, Zadie.

35
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:19,336
<i>Zadie?</i>

36
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,511
Zadie?

37
00:05:30,978 --> 00:05:31,978
Zadie?

38
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:43,888
<i>Hey, Shelly.</i>

39
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,658
<i>Oh, stop!</i>

40
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:50,131
There were
other options, Zadie.

41
00:05:50,132 --> 00:05:51,731
I wish you'd talked to me first.

42
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:19,256
<i>Hi, you've reached Dom.
Leave a message.</i>

43
00:06:19,257 --> 00:06:20,754
Dom, it's me.

44
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,462
Zadie's lost her fucking mind.

45
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,762
She just sent me
some video that you shot.

46
00:06:24,763 --> 00:06:27,063
Meet me at Zadie's.
I'm gonna check on her.

47
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:22,151
Whoa, whoa.
What're you doing, huh?

48
00:07:31,636 --> 00:07:34,364
Yeah, we have a 10-50, female in her 20s.

49
00:07:34,365 --> 00:07:35,433
Bringing her in.

50
00:08:04,766 --> 00:08:06,599
- Say something.
- Wake up, Eric.

51
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,894
Are you gonna
stand up for yourself?

52
00:08:07,895 --> 00:08:09,030
Look at me.

53
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,362
What're you gonna do about it?

54
00:08:10,363 --> 00:08:12,032
You're fucking old enough
to look after yourself.

55
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,473
Daddy's gonna come back.

56
00:08:13,474 --> 00:08:14,789
- We're here.
- Say something.

57
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,105
- Hello. Are you there?
- Say something!

58
00:08:16,106 --> 00:08:18,145
- Nothin'? You got nothin'?
- Where's your mom right now?

59
00:08:19,414 --> 00:08:20,682
Say something, son!

60
00:08:23,146 --> 00:08:24,887
- Wake the fuck up.
- Say something, man!

61
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,422
Say fucking something!

62
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,789
<i>I know
this is hard, Eric.</i>

63
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,242
<i>But these exercises
are meant to get you past</i>

64
00:08:32,243 --> 00:08:34,696
the destructive behaviors
that brought you here.

65
00:08:36,092 --> 00:08:39,068
Burying it... using drugs...

66
00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:41,062
That's the easy way out.

67
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:44,640
It's what allows you
to hide that pain away.

68
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:50,712
You, uh, going to join us?

69
00:08:53,608 --> 00:08:57,147
You know, Hemingway wrote,
"The world breaks everyone,

70
00:08:57,714 --> 00:08:59,080
<i>"and afterwards,</i>

71
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:02,002
<i>"many are strong
at the broken places.</i>

72
00:09:02,003 --> 00:09:04,924
<i>"But those
that will not break...</i>

73
00:09:06,327 --> 00:09:07,388
<i>"it kills."</i>

74
00:09:27,482 --> 00:09:28,976
...group therapy after that.

75
00:09:28,977 --> 00:09:31,682
No phones.
No talking after dark.

76
00:09:31,683 --> 00:09:33,590
No fraternizing with the men.

77
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,495
Mr. Roeg.

78
00:10:14,496 --> 00:10:16,265
Here's the young protege
from Vienna

79
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:17,590
I was telling Marion about.

80
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:21,132
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Roeg.

81
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:23,167
Please.

82
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,641
Sit.

83
00:10:28,237 --> 00:10:30,009
Now, you know
I was born in Vienna,

84
00:10:30,941 --> 00:10:34,177
a cradle of immortal music.

85
00:10:34,178 --> 00:10:36,949
I've lived long enough to see
some of the greats play.

86
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,150
They tell me that
you're quite dynamic yourself.

87
00:10:41,116 --> 00:10:43,088
- May I borrow you?
- Yes.

88
00:10:43,895 --> 00:10:45,053
Um...

89
00:10:45,054 --> 00:10:46,795
I look forward
to hearing you play.

90
00:10:52,102 --> 00:10:53,197
What is it?

91
00:10:53,797 --> 00:10:54,968
We found her.

92
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,583
It's all right, Zadie.

93
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:14,691
It's all right.

94
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:16,825
What's done is done.

95
00:11:17,856 --> 00:11:19,619
We're looking for your friends.

96
00:11:21,155 --> 00:11:22,226
Have you seen Shelly?

97
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,960
No.

98
00:11:25,961 --> 00:11:28,067
You're a good person, Zadie.

99
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,872
You wouldn't tell me
if you knew.

100
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,138
Would you?

101
00:11:37,472 --> 00:11:40,406
I've killed hundreds
of innocents like you

102
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:42,246
in the centuries
that I've been here.

103
00:11:43,211 --> 00:11:45,249
It never gets any easier.

104
00:11:51,287 --> 00:11:54,009
I wish
the murderers and rapists,

105
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,733
and scum of the earth would do,

106
00:11:57,562 --> 00:11:58,562
but...

107
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,771
they go to hell already,
you see.

108
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:05,804
Whereas people like you,

109
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:08,300
those are the souls
that he wants.

110
00:12:08,301 --> 00:12:10,912
That's the... the deal I made.

111
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,750
You go to hell

112
00:12:14,813 --> 00:12:16,082
so I don't have to.

113
00:12:17,688 --> 00:12:20,614
Please...
Please let me go.

114
00:12:21,224 --> 00:12:22,385
You can go.

115
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:32,086
What the fuck is going on here?

116
00:13:32,087 --> 00:13:34,220
Get your shit together!

117
00:13:34,221 --> 00:13:35,729
You know why we still out here?

118
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,628
It's because of your bullshit!
Huh?

119
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,120
Hi.

120
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:11,626
They don't like you in here,
do they?

121
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,168
No, not really.

122
00:14:17,705 --> 00:14:19,135
They have a thing about

123
00:14:19,136 --> 00:14:20,473
men and women
not sitting together.

124
00:14:20,474 --> 00:14:21,504
I know.

125
00:14:22,346 --> 00:14:23,473
They told me.

126
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,110
I like your tattoo.

127
00:14:28,944 --> 00:14:29,985
Thanks.

128
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,450
"Laugh now. Cry later."

129
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:36,824
It's kind of how things
have been playing out for me.

130
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:38,928
Well, for me,
it's more like "cry now,

131
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:40,820
"cry later."

132
00:14:46,194 --> 00:14:47,700
Wanna hear a joke?

133
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:49,700
Uh, I don't know. Is it funny?

134
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:50,998
Not really.

135
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:53,272
Great. Go for it.

136
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:56,671
What kind of tea
is hard to drink?

137
00:14:57,711 --> 00:14:58,978
I don't know.

138
00:14:58,979 --> 00:15:00,246
Reali-ty.

139
00:15:02,146 --> 00:15:04,014
Yeah. Wow. Well, that's...

140
00:15:04,015 --> 00:15:05,680
That's something.

141
00:15:07,084 --> 00:15:08,722
I'll keep working on it.

142
00:15:08,723 --> 00:15:10,692
Hey, time
for your group session.

143
00:15:10,693 --> 00:15:12,691
Here he comes,
like fucking clockwork.

144
00:15:12,692 --> 00:15:13,721
What's your name?

145
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:15,591
I'm Eric.

146
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:17,191
Shelly.

147
00:15:17,192 --> 00:15:18,858
I'll see you around, Shelly.

148
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,293
If you were
forced to be silent,

149
00:15:48,092 --> 00:15:49,559
step into the circle.

150
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:54,765
If you were made
to feel that anything wrong

151
00:15:54,766 --> 00:15:56,071
is your fault,

152
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:58,139
step into the circle.

153
00:16:00,478 --> 00:16:02,161
If you were abandoned,

154
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,845
neglected, manipulated

155
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:05,982
by those who were
meant to protect you,

156
00:16:06,814 --> 00:16:08,413
step into the circle.

157
00:16:10,412 --> 00:16:13,118
If you are ready to look forward

158
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:15,414
to the good things
that life will bring you,

159
00:16:15,415 --> 00:16:17,158
step into the circle.

160
00:16:30,465 --> 00:16:32,206
We're pleased you found her.

161
00:16:35,407 --> 00:16:37,508
We're so fond of you
and your daughter.

162
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,166
You all right?

163
00:17:00,262 --> 00:17:02,629
Oh, hey. Yeah.

164
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,769
Fuck, they really
trashed the place, huh?

165
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,142
Um... Yeah.

166
00:17:10,777 --> 00:17:11,806
Is this me?

167
00:17:17,685 --> 00:17:18,813
All right.

168
00:17:25,992 --> 00:17:28,460
These songs or poems?

169
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:31,364
I wouldn't call them either.
It's just shit that I write.

170
00:17:38,286 --> 00:17:40,106
You write beautifully.

171
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:42,111
Some of this would be great
set to music.

172
00:17:42,744 --> 00:17:44,542
Do you play music?

173
00:17:45,349 --> 00:17:46,445
Used to.

174
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:50,364
Well, maybe we could, um...

175
00:17:50,365 --> 00:17:52,517
I don't know, maybe, um...

176
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,785
Maybe we could
play together sometime.

177
00:17:58,725 --> 00:18:00,485
Maybe.

178
00:18:00,486 --> 00:18:02,362
See how we get along.

179
00:18:03,701 --> 00:18:05,200
What are you doing in here?

180
00:18:05,932 --> 00:18:07,299
I don't know.

181
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,799
I guess everything
just finally caught up with me.

182
00:18:38,969 --> 00:18:42,267
<i>Patient 005, Shelly,</i>

183
00:18:42,268 --> 00:18:45,036
<i>please be advised
you have a visitor.</i>

184
00:18:45,037 --> 00:18:46,340
No one knows I'm here.

185
00:18:47,778 --> 00:18:50,245
Hey. I'll go have a look, okay?

186
00:19:00,323 --> 00:19:03,549
I mean, it just looks
like fucking lawyers to me.

187
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,754
Come on, take a look.

188
00:19:10,726 --> 00:19:12,461
What the fuck?

189
00:19:12,462 --> 00:19:14,496
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

190
00:19:14,497 --> 00:19:16,532
- Who are they?
- They can't find me here.

191
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:17,773
If they find me here,
I'm fucked.

192
00:19:17,774 --> 00:19:19,604
Her room is right this way.

193
00:19:20,902 --> 00:19:22,438
- I've got to get out of here.
- Yeah, yeah.

194
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:23,758
- They can't find me here.
- Um...

195
00:19:24,814 --> 00:19:26,775
- Fuck!
- Come with me.

196
00:19:26,776 --> 00:19:30,246
Could you give me a location
update on Patient 005?

197
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,886
Okay, here it is. You see
those windows up there?

198
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,159
- Yeah.
- They'll take you out to the yard.

199
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,811
- Okay.
- Wait, wait, wait.

200
00:19:42,812 --> 00:19:44,464
You gotta get the tag off.

201
00:19:47,495 --> 00:19:49,093
Can you pick up their signal?

202
00:19:49,094 --> 00:19:50,894
<i>They're in the laundry room.</i>

00:20:00,145 --> 00:20:01,826

204
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:03,501
Fuck this place.

205
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,177

Hey, slow, slow down.

217
00:20:55,134 --> 00:20:56,272
Stop.

218
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:01,937
Who were those people?

219
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,203
A former life.

220
00:21:06,242 --> 00:21:07,283
Right.

221
00:21:08,378 --> 00:21:09,549
Got one of those.

222
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:15,324
I bet you do.

223
00:21:44,954 --> 00:21:46,913
Jesus, this is crazy.

224
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:50,255
It's my friend's place.
He lives in Antigua.

225
00:21:50,256 --> 00:21:51,855
Lets me crash here sometimes.

226
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,259
So, um...

227
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:02,503
What now?

228
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,168
You know,
you don't have to stay.

229
00:22:09,507 --> 00:22:11,138
Maybe it's safer if you don't.

230
00:22:15,753 --> 00:22:17,177
I want to stay.

231
00:22:19,746 --> 00:22:20,983
Okay. Well, then,

232
00:22:22,025 --> 00:22:23,656
we'll hide out here for a while.

233
00:22:25,763 --> 00:22:26,989
And then what?

234
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,499
We'll hide somewhere else.

235
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:34,029
Just figure it out.

236
00:22:35,464 --> 00:22:36,636
Good plan.

237
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,408
It is a good plan.

238
00:22:44,782 --> 00:22:46,178
You stink, dude.

239
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:47,740
I'm sorry.

240
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,242
Do you mind if I use the shower?

241
00:22:49,851 --> 00:22:51,083
Not yet.

242
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:50,545
Pretty good.

243
00:23:57,915 --> 00:23:59,821
What's the first thing
you liked about me

244
00:23:59,822 --> 00:24:01,050
when you saw me?

245
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,272
What's, um...

246
00:24:04,587 --> 00:24:06,418
There's like an aura about you.

247
00:24:07,062 --> 00:24:08,497
It feels powerful.

248
00:24:10,565 --> 00:24:12,391
What's the first thing
you liked about me?

249
00:24:14,131 --> 00:24:17,099
I thought that you were
quite brilliantly broken.

250
00:24:18,368 --> 00:24:20,171
You are.

251
00:24:26,147 --> 00:24:27,513
What's the, um...

252
00:24:27,514 --> 00:24:29,276
What's the worst thing
you've ever done?

253
00:24:33,657 --> 00:24:38,024
I once escaped rehab with
a complete fucking degenerate.

254
00:24:40,691 --> 00:24:42,421
Probably the best thing
I've ever done.

255
00:24:43,493 --> 00:24:45,365
Mm.

256
00:24:45,366 --> 00:24:47,129
Wait, I just
remembered something.

257
00:24:54,065 --> 00:24:55,709
You have a secret stash here?

258
00:24:56,506 --> 00:24:57,612
All right.

259
00:24:57,979 --> 00:24:59,108
Hello.

260
00:25:00,443 --> 00:25:01,478
Aha.

261
00:25:01,479 --> 00:25:03,211
- Those are the ones?
- Mm-hmm.

262
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:06,254
Lamb of God.

263
00:25:12,661 --> 00:25:15,008
Stop looking at me
or I'll poke your eye out.

264
00:25:15,009 --> 00:25:17,357
- Poke out my eye?
- Mm-hmm. You don't need that.

265
00:25:17,968 --> 00:25:19,099

Mm.

284
00:26:29,205 --> 00:26:30,969
try to love me harder.

Marion.

You have a problem.

287
00:28:00,758 --> 00:28:02,126

288
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:08,928
Yes?

289
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:11,133
They found Zadie's body.

290
00:28:11,134 --> 00:28:14,269
And here I thought
there was nothing left to find.

291
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:17,404
It's a setback, but we're close
on one of the others.

00:29:06,358 --> 00:29:07,389
Rimbaud.

00:29:08,188 --> 00:29:09,824
Shall I read you some?

302
00:29:09,825 --> 00:29:11,197
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

303
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,906
Hell yeah!

304
00:29:33,081 --> 00:29:34,548

Yes. Go on.

318
00:31:22,122 --> 00:31:23,558
I can't do this right now.

319
00:31:24,497 --> 00:31:25,758
Okay.

320
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,036
You all right? What's going on?

321
00:31:34,907 --> 00:31:36,769
Could we just go out for a bit?

322
00:31:38,979 --> 00:31:41,048
I haven't played piano
for a while.

323
00:31:42,847 --> 00:31:44,183
I loved playing.

324
00:31:45,884 --> 00:31:47,681
It was my whole life.

325
00:31:48,891 --> 00:31:52,424
But my mom took it
and twisted it all,

326
00:31:52,425 --> 00:31:55,958
pushed me
into performing at places

327
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:57,625
I was too young to be at.

328
00:31:59,769 --> 00:32:01,299
Didn't want to play
for any of them.

329
00:32:05,771 --> 00:32:07,541
I saw things.

330
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:09,736
I shouldn't have seen any of it.

331
00:32:12,008 --> 00:32:13,476
I hurt people.

332
00:32:15,452 --> 00:32:16,644
And I just...

333
00:32:18,551 --> 00:32:19,779
I know.

334
00:32:21,852 --> 00:32:22,958
It's okay.

335
00:32:23,624 --> 00:32:24,960
It's not okay.

336
00:32:27,595 --> 00:32:29,175
What did you do?

337
00:32:29,176 --> 00:32:30,757
I can't tell you.

338
00:32:33,097 --> 00:32:35,432
If you knew, you'd leave me.

339
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:40,169
And if you left me, I'd die.

340
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:42,873
If I left you,
I'd already be dead.

341
00:32:42,874 --> 00:32:44,577
I just want to start over.

342
00:32:44,578 --> 00:32:45,937
Well, why don't we?

343
00:32:46,746 --> 00:32:48,211
Where would we go?

344
00:32:48,212 --> 00:32:49,677
Fuckin' anywhere.

345
00:32:51,987 --> 00:32:54,154
Anywhere is better
than this fucking place.

346
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:56,213
Anywhere?

347
00:32:56,214 --> 00:32:57,351
Anywhere.

348
00:32:57,352 --> 00:32:59,995
So you're saying
if I jumped,

349
00:33:01,597 --> 00:33:03,361
you'd jump with me.

350
00:33:09,098 --> 00:33:10,203
Of course I would.

351
00:33:15,612 --> 00:33:17,206
Do you think angsty teens

352
00:33:17,207 --> 00:33:19,476
would build
little shrines for us?

353
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:25,109
Yeah. They'd be lining up
to leave cigarettes and whiskey.

354
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,164
No.

355
00:33:26,165 --> 00:33:27,220
No?

356
00:33:27,917 --> 00:33:29,222
Lilies.

357
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:32,654
A sea of white lilies.

358
00:33:34,356 --> 00:33:37,956
All right. Lilies, it is.

359
00:34:17,706 --> 00:34:18,931
I told you, bro.

360
00:34:19,873 --> 00:34:21,670
I fucking love this guy!

361
00:34:24,244 --> 00:34:26,339
I'm gonna go
and get some water.

362
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,476
I can get it for you.

363
00:34:27,477 --> 00:34:28,613
No, no. You stay there.

364
00:34:28,614 --> 00:34:29,616
Sure.

365
00:34:34,188 --> 00:34:35,522
Can I get
some water, please?

366
00:34:35,523 --> 00:34:36,715
Shelly! Shelly!

367
00:34:36,716 --> 00:34:37,824
- Dom... What the fuck?
- Just listen to me.

368
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,064
Just listen to me. Just listen.

369
00:34:39,529 --> 00:34:41,158
Zadie's dead.

370
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,159
They're gonna
come for us, Shelly.

371
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,695
You need to leave town now.

372
00:34:44,696 --> 00:34:46,230
What do you mean?

373
00:34:46,231 --> 00:34:48,017
Shelly, you gotta
listen to me. It's true.

374
00:34:48,018 --> 00:34:49,804
No, no, no.
I'm not leaving without Eric.

375
00:34:49,805 --> 00:34:51,354
No.
Shelly, just listen to me.

376
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:52,904
Are you hearing what I'm saying?

377
00:34:52,905 --> 00:34:54,274
Zadie's fucking dead!

378
00:34:56,376 --> 00:34:58,628
- Come on, we've gotta leave.
- What's going on?

379
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:00,882
- We've gotta leave, Eric.
- Who the fuck was that?

380
00:35:00,883 --> 00:35:02,247
I'll tell you
everything.

381
00:35:02,248 --> 00:35:03,613
Let's just get back
to your place.

382
00:35:59,973 --> 00:36:01,539
Shelly?

383
00:36:02,669 --> 00:36:04,239
Shelly!

384
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,676
Get off her! Get off her!

385
00:36:08,948 --> 00:36:11,117
No, don't do this.

386
00:36:11,118 --> 00:36:13,611
No, please don't do this.
Get off of her!

387
00:36:13,612 --> 00:36:14,983
Please don't do this.

388
00:38:22,048 --> 00:38:23,175
What the fuck!

389
00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:36,089
Shelly?

390
00:38:45,674 --> 00:38:46,674
Hey.

391
00:38:47,236 --> 00:38:48,236
Hey!

392
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,010
Hey?

393
00:39:11,592 --> 00:39:12,859
Hey!

394
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,127
Where am I?

395
00:39:15,465 --> 00:39:16,800
What is this place?

396
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,565
You'd think they'd come up
with something better,

397
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:21,574
wouldn't you?

398
00:39:22,603 --> 00:39:24,274
But you know,

399
00:39:24,275 --> 00:39:26,040
they don't expect us to linger.

400
00:39:29,209 --> 00:39:33,017
How long we stay here
is entirely up to you.

401
00:39:34,786 --> 00:39:37,887
<i>...we stay
here is entirely up to you.</i>

402
00:39:52,241 --> 00:39:53,503
What the fuck
is happening to me?

403
00:39:53,504 --> 00:39:57,443
People once believed
when someone dies,

404
00:39:57,444 --> 00:40:00,214
a crow carries their soul
to the land of the dead.

405
00:40:00,215 --> 00:40:03,008
But sometimes,
something so bad happens

406
00:40:03,009 --> 00:40:05,717
that a terrible sadness
is carried with it...

407
00:40:07,023 --> 00:40:08,753
and the soul cannot rest.

408
00:40:11,555 --> 00:40:13,021
What are you talking about?

409
00:40:14,563 --> 00:40:18,092
The crow will guide you
to put the wrong things right.

410
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,629
What do you mean?

411
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,804
Oh, fuck this. This isn't real.

412
00:40:25,864 --> 00:40:27,933
You stay the fuck away from me.

413
00:40:27,934 --> 00:40:30,002
There's nothing there but here.

414
00:40:30,003 --> 00:40:31,743
This is all
just a fucking nightmare.

415
00:40:33,282 --> 00:40:35,241
This is just
a fucking nightmare.

416
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,244
Then go wake up.

417
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,156
<i>The sadness is killing...</i>

418
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,009
Shelly?

419
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:12,586
Shelly?

420
00:41:52,487 --> 00:41:54,218
My turn.

421
00:41:54,219 --> 00:41:57,026
Come on, Shelly.
You don't respect my art.

422
00:42:12,641 --> 00:42:13,845
I'm here.

423
00:42:15,041 --> 00:42:16,613
What am I looking for exactly?

424
00:42:16,614 --> 00:42:18,749
<i>- Her cell phone.</i>
- All right.

425
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,654
<i>We looked,
but we were interrupted.</i>

426
00:42:22,724 --> 00:42:24,823
- What's on it?
<i>- You don't need to know.</i>

427
00:42:25,357 --> 00:42:26,521
<i>Just find it.</i>

428
00:42:26,522 --> 00:42:27,760
All right. All right.

429
00:42:36,138 --> 00:42:37,737
You can come out, boy.

430
00:42:39,965 --> 00:42:41,037
Who are you?

431
00:42:41,537 --> 00:42:42,709
I'm a cop.

432
00:42:43,736 --> 00:42:44,876
Here.

433
00:42:45,408 --> 00:42:46,971
Come on.

434
00:42:46,972 --> 00:42:48,158
- Okay.
- It's okay.

435
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:49,345
- Drop that. Drop that.
- Yeah.

436
00:42:50,448 --> 00:42:51,615
Listen, I think I'm going crazy.

437
00:42:51,616 --> 00:42:53,452
I don't know what's real
or not anymore.

438
00:42:53,453 --> 00:42:54,790
I just think
something really bad

439
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:56,128
has happened with my girlfriend.

440
00:43:02,194 --> 00:43:03,224
Fuck.

441
00:43:18,542 --> 00:43:19,779
What the fuck?

442
00:43:21,049 --> 00:43:22,210
Oh, fuck.

443
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,844
Oh, no.

444
00:45:01,775 --> 00:45:03,461
Ah, what the fuck!

445
00:45:03,462 --> 00:45:05,148
What the fuck!

446
00:45:18,529 --> 00:45:21,491
<i>The crow will guide you
to put the wrong things right.</i>

447
00:45:21,492 --> 00:45:24,662
<i>...wrong things right.</i>

448
00:45:24,663 --> 00:45:27,934
<i>The crow will guide you
to put the wrong things right.</i>

449
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,136
<i>People once believed...</i>

00:45:29,137 --> 00:45:32,537

457
00:46:06,378 --> 00:46:07,474
Shelly?

458
00:46:09,614 --> 00:46:10,681
Shelly, baby.

459
00:46:10,682 --> 00:46:12,312
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's okay.

460
00:46:12,313 --> 00:46:14,153
It's okay. Don't...
Look, come down from there.

461
00:46:18,889 --> 00:46:20,553
It's okay. No, no, no, no, no!

462
00:46:21,129 --> 00:46:22,129
No!

463
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:42,278
She's dead, isn't she?

464
00:46:42,944 --> 00:46:44,412
We're both dead.

465
00:46:44,946 --> 00:46:46,348
I'm afraid so.

466
00:46:57,596 --> 00:46:58,657
What are you?

467
00:47:00,226 --> 00:47:01,728
Some kind of angel?

468
00:47:03,834 --> 00:47:05,466
Do I look like an angel?

469
00:47:08,268 --> 00:47:09,536
I don't understand.

470
00:47:11,337 --> 00:47:13,012
Why am I here and she isn't?

471
00:47:14,847 --> 00:47:16,711
You're not gonna
like the answer.

472
00:47:16,712 --> 00:47:18,208
Just tell me.

473
00:47:18,209 --> 00:47:20,915
She's on her way down.

474
00:47:20,916 --> 00:47:23,220
To a place far worse than this.

475
00:47:26,961 --> 00:47:29,219
You said I could make
the wrong things right.

476
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,822
What does that mean?

477
00:47:30,823 --> 00:47:33,423
The one who killed you is not supposed
to be in your world.

478
00:47:33,424 --> 00:47:35,335
They made a deal with the devil

479
00:47:35,336 --> 00:47:37,470
to gain eternal life

480
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,368
by sending the innocent to hell.

481
00:47:40,266 --> 00:47:41,733
That's not balance.

482
00:47:43,509 --> 00:47:44,736
Kill them.

483
00:47:45,809 --> 00:47:47,447
Kill them all.

484
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:49,440
And you get your lives back.

485
00:47:49,441 --> 00:47:51,083
You're saying
I can get her back?

486
00:47:51,516 --> 00:47:52,810
Yeah.

487
00:47:55,557 --> 00:47:57,472
Kill the ones who killed you,

488
00:47:57,473 --> 00:47:59,388
and you will get her back.

489
00:48:06,699 --> 00:48:08,100
When I was up there,

490
00:48:08,963 --> 00:48:10,098
I got shot.

491
00:48:10,099 --> 00:48:12,269
And it taught you something,
didn't it?

492
00:48:13,036 --> 00:48:15,473
What I, um... I can heal?

493
00:48:15,474 --> 00:48:17,088
I can't die?

494
00:48:17,089 --> 00:48:18,704
Your body? No.

495
00:48:19,315 --> 00:48:22,507
Feel pain? Yes.

496
00:48:22,508 --> 00:48:25,711
If your love remains pure,
you cannot die.

497
00:48:26,885 --> 00:48:28,714
How am I supposed to trust you?

498
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:31,926
Do you have another choice?

499
00:48:34,594 --> 00:48:35,886
Are you ready?

500
00:48:49,245 --> 00:48:50,604
Holy shit.

501
00:48:51,414 --> 00:48:53,474
Eric, what the fuck?

502
00:48:53,475 --> 00:48:55,950
Where have you been?
Everyone thought you was dead.

503
00:48:56,749 --> 00:48:58,551
Everyone was right.

504
00:48:58,552 --> 00:49:00,383
Very funny. Just come inside.

505
00:49:04,218 --> 00:49:05,718
I need your help, man.

506
00:49:06,758 --> 00:49:08,127
What do you need?

507
00:49:11,466 --> 00:49:12,758
I need a gun.

508
00:49:13,532 --> 00:49:14,757
A gun.

509
00:49:14,758 --> 00:49:16,971
Eric, what...
What are you gonna do with a...

510
00:49:19,641 --> 00:49:21,338
You know what, it's not my...

511
00:49:36,823 --> 00:49:38,355
You're going to need these.

512
00:50:03,474 --> 00:50:05,283
I'm a friend of your daughter's.

513
00:50:06,785 --> 00:50:07,945
We need to talk.

514
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:23,330
Who was after her?

515
00:50:23,331 --> 00:50:25,971
Why did you
come for her that day?

516
00:50:25,972 --> 00:50:28,070
I saw you there
with the people who killed her.

517
00:50:28,071 --> 00:50:29,740
What are you talking about?

518
00:50:29,741 --> 00:50:31,177
It was an overdose.

519
00:50:32,471 --> 00:50:33,776
How would you know?

520
00:50:33,777 --> 00:50:35,082
Because I was there.

521
00:50:45,356 --> 00:50:47,886
You don't understand
who you're dealing with.

522
00:50:56,669 --> 00:50:58,266
I loved her.

523
00:50:58,267 --> 00:51:01,037
I need to know
who these people are

524
00:51:01,038 --> 00:51:02,769
because I'm going to kill them.

525
00:51:03,536 --> 00:51:05,178
Every single one of them.

526
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:09,182
And I'm gonna bring her back.

527
00:51:09,849 --> 00:51:11,580
She's not coming back.

528
00:51:13,687 --> 00:51:15,188
My baby's gone.

529
00:51:18,724 --> 00:51:20,424
She's gone.

530
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:23,691
And she's not coming back.

531
00:51:30,935 --> 00:51:32,139
Please leave me.

532
00:51:32,705 --> 00:51:33,705
Just stop.

533
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:38,442
She's gone.

00:54:13,899 --> 00:54:15,628
I want names

549
00:54:15,629 --> 00:54:17,403
of all the people
that you work for.

550
00:54:20,707 --> 00:54:21,869
Don't!

551
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:25,008
Fuck!

552
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:26,740
Get down!

553
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:30,674
Drive!

554
00:55:48,423 --> 00:55:49,423
Get in the back!

555
00:57:16,544 --> 00:57:17,649
Hello, Sophia.

556
00:57:24,554 --> 00:57:26,218
I'm sorry it's been so long.

557
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,056
Truly.

558
00:57:30,866 --> 00:57:32,196
My condolences.

559
00:57:32,197 --> 00:57:34,226
Shelly was such a special girl.

560
00:57:45,443 --> 00:57:46,744
I heard you had a visitor.

561
00:57:48,116 --> 00:57:49,483
What did he want?

562
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:51,674
He wants to kill you.

563
00:57:51,675 --> 00:57:53,448
Oh. Anger.

564
00:57:53,449 --> 00:57:55,250
First impulse.

565
00:57:55,251 --> 00:57:56,535
It's not anger.

566
00:57:56,536 --> 00:57:57,821
What is it, then?

567
00:58:08,066 --> 00:58:09,096
Love.

568
00:58:09,971 --> 00:58:12,030
Loved her so much.

569
00:58:12,031 --> 00:58:14,673
He told me he was going
to bring her back.

570
00:58:16,736 --> 00:58:18,241
What was that?

571
00:58:18,242 --> 00:58:20,973
He thinks if he kills you,

572
00:58:20,974 --> 00:58:23,115
he'll be able to bring
her back from the dead.

573
00:58:31,926 --> 00:58:33,658
Oh, Shelly.

574
00:58:33,659 --> 00:58:38,290
So many times you needed me,
and I was never there.

575
00:58:42,771 --> 00:58:43,771
Stop it.

576
00:58:45,302 --> 00:58:46,496
She's gone.

577
00:58:49,278 --> 00:58:50,973
You traded her
for a better life.

578
00:58:53,709 --> 00:58:55,010
That took a lot of courage.

579
00:58:57,383 --> 00:59:00,084
What you gave me was not a gift,

580
00:59:00,085 --> 00:59:01,379
it was a curse.

581
00:59:02,883 --> 00:59:05,116
I would rather have died.

582
00:59:05,117 --> 00:59:07,891
Well, then you should
go and be with her.

583
00:59:33,877 --> 00:59:35,182
No!

584
00:59:58,508 --> 00:59:59,903
- Marion.
<i>- Yes?</i>

585
00:59:59,904 --> 01:00:01,909
He has been sent back.

586
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:04,574
The power to escape death
exists within him.

587
01:00:06,054 --> 01:00:07,054
Bring him to me.

588
01:00:25,566 --> 01:00:26,601
Fuck.

589
01:00:26,602 --> 01:00:28,055
I'm just... Don't hurt me, man.

590
01:00:28,056 --> 01:00:29,508
- Please.
- Why the fuck not?

591
01:00:29,509 --> 01:00:32,002
- I didn't do anything, man.
- I saw you.

592
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,219
- What?
- In the club.

593
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:34,436
You brought them to us.

594
01:00:34,437 --> 01:00:36,073
No, no. I was just
trying to get her out.

595
01:00:36,074 --> 01:00:37,710
I was just trying
to help her get away, man.

596
01:00:37,711 --> 01:00:42,213
Get away from what? Huh?

597
01:00:42,214 --> 01:00:44,914
That woman who was after her,
who is she?

598
01:00:44,915 --> 01:00:46,214
Who, Marion?

599
01:00:46,215 --> 01:00:47,787
No. No. She's just part of it.

600
01:00:47,788 --> 01:00:49,355
She just works for him.

601
01:00:50,254 --> 01:00:52,028
Who are you talking about? Who?

602
01:00:53,796 --> 01:00:56,331
His name is Vincent Roeg, man.

603
01:00:56,332 --> 01:00:58,867
He used to have us
over to party.

604
01:00:58,868 --> 01:01:00,674
I thought it was just
an easy place to score.

605
01:01:01,506 --> 01:01:02,940
That shit got so dark.

606
01:01:05,246 --> 01:01:06,779
He made it so dark.

607
01:01:10,516 --> 01:01:12,180
He's got this voice, man.

608
01:01:14,483 --> 01:01:15,689
Voice.

609
01:01:16,786 --> 01:01:20,250
He... burrows inside you.

610
01:01:20,251 --> 01:01:22,624
Finds the darkest parts
of your soul

611
01:01:22,625 --> 01:01:24,792
and gives them a voice.

612
01:01:24,793 --> 01:01:28,526
And it just gets
louder and louder

613
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:32,068
until you do something evil.

614
01:01:32,965 --> 01:01:34,070
I still hear it.

615
01:01:41,308 --> 01:01:42,810
I never would have
made that fucking video

616
01:01:42,811 --> 01:01:44,314
if I'd known
what would have happened, man.

617
01:01:44,315 --> 01:01:45,675
What video?

618
01:01:46,351 --> 01:01:47,616
Where is it?

619
01:01:47,617 --> 01:01:49,316
Shelly had it on her phone.

620
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:51,951
Said she had it hidden.

621
01:01:51,952 --> 01:01:54,750
She didn't want
anyone to see it.

622
01:01:54,751 --> 01:01:57,159
I tried to warn her,
but she wouldn't leave without you.

623
01:01:59,664 --> 01:02:01,863
I knew Shelly a long time.

624
01:02:01,864 --> 01:02:03,495
When I saw the way
she looked at you,

625
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:06,102
something was different.

626
01:02:08,708 --> 01:02:10,337
I tried to do
something right, man.

627
01:02:11,312 --> 01:02:12,339
I just fucked it up.

628
01:02:14,577 --> 01:02:15,914
I'm sorry.

629
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:20,248
They won't be far behind me.

630
01:02:22,251 --> 01:02:25,616
You do what we couldn't do.
Get the fuck out.

631
01:02:28,822 --> 01:02:30,151
Thanks, man.

632
01:03:35,224 --> 01:03:36,929
<i>How many people
have you loved?</i>

633
01:03:39,898 --> 01:03:43,298
<i>Like seriously,
seriously loved?</i>

634
01:04:56,311 --> 01:04:57,874
<i>Oh, stop!</i>

635
01:04:57,875 --> 01:04:59,737
<i>I will come back.</i>

636
01:05:18,596 --> 01:05:19,993
<i>What the fuck!</i>

637
01:05:19,994 --> 01:05:21,393
<i>What did you do to her?</i>

638
01:05:21,394 --> 01:05:23,215
<i>Oh, my God,
there's blood everywhere.</i>

639
01:05:23,216 --> 01:05:25,037
<i>What the fuck, Shelly? Help me!</i>

640
01:05:27,166 --> 01:05:28,297
<i>She's dying.</i>

641
01:05:28,298 --> 01:05:29,641
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

642
01:05:29,642 --> 01:05:31,439
Oh...

643
01:05:32,906 --> 01:05:33,906
Oh...

644
01:05:35,715 --> 01:05:37,379
Oh...

645

651
01:07:03,903 --> 01:07:06,652
I found
what they killed her for.

652
01:07:06,653 --> 01:07:08,996
Shelly, she did something
really bad.

653
01:07:08,997 --> 01:07:11,341
And now I can't get it
out of my head.

654
01:07:13,274 --> 01:07:14,945
I don't think I can do this.

655
01:07:14,946 --> 01:07:16,347
I don't think
I can do this, man.

656
01:07:16,348 --> 01:07:17,682
Eric, you just need
to sit down, bro.

657
01:07:17,683 --> 01:07:19,016
- Fuck.
- Eric, sit down, please.

658
01:07:19,017 --> 01:07:21,186
Please. Eric, come on.
Come on. Just sit down.

659
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:26,356
What's going on?

660
01:07:29,122 --> 01:07:30,620
Holy shit.

661
01:07:30,621 --> 01:07:32,660
Why didn't she just
fucking tell me?

662
01:07:32,661 --> 01:07:34,700
She should have
just fucking told me.

663
01:07:34,701 --> 01:07:37,532
Okay, but, if she did tell you,

664
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:39,666
could you still love her?

665
01:07:45,907 --> 01:07:46,907
Eric?

666
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:49,082
What the fuck?

667
01:07:54,381 --> 01:07:55,616
You need to come with us.

668
01:08:36,892 --> 01:08:38,329
Fuck.

669
01:09:04,451 --> 01:09:05,950
What the fuck have you done?

670
01:09:45,524 --> 01:09:46,991
Why am I back here?

671
01:09:48,993 --> 01:09:50,713
You couldn't see it through.

672
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,964
Hey. Why...

673
01:09:55,303 --> 01:09:57,074
Why did I stop healing?

674
01:09:57,075 --> 01:09:59,971
I said your love
needed to remain pure.

675
01:10:01,211 --> 01:10:03,516
The enemy of love is not hate.

676
01:10:03,517 --> 01:10:04,682
It's doubt.

677
01:10:04,683 --> 01:10:06,252
I never doubted her.

678
01:10:08,512 --> 01:10:09,552
Didn't you?

679
01:10:18,461 --> 01:10:21,379
You had a chance
and you wasted it.

680
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:23,957
You were given
the power of a god.

681
01:10:23,958 --> 01:10:26,536
In the end, you were just a boy.

682
01:10:28,073 --> 01:10:31,340
At least your soul can move on.

683
01:10:31,341 --> 01:10:34,505
Her soul is gone forever
into the darkness.

684
01:10:34,506 --> 01:10:36,807
For you, eternity is easy.

685
01:10:36,808 --> 01:10:39,109
You just have to breathe.

686
01:10:42,019 --> 01:10:43,113
And let her go.

687
01:10:43,722 --> 01:10:44,785
I can't.

688
01:10:47,661 --> 01:10:48,888
I'm sorry.

689
01:11:03,007 --> 01:11:04,039
Mine for hers.

690
01:11:11,752 --> 01:11:13,418
My soul for hers.

691
01:11:19,926 --> 01:11:22,490
Her soul is damned.

692
01:11:22,491 --> 01:11:24,730
The place she's going,
you can't imagine it.

693
01:11:24,731 --> 01:11:26,299
It's not about me.

694
01:11:30,761 --> 01:11:32,531
Even if you save her,

695
01:11:32,532 --> 01:11:34,439
you will never
be with her again.

696
01:11:37,138 --> 01:11:38,234
I know.

697
01:11:42,443 --> 01:11:43,844
Now let me do this.

698
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:06,339
It's not up to me.

699
01:12:19,417 --> 01:12:21,178
There is no going back
from this.

700
01:13:21,075 --> 01:13:24,549
With this black blood,
you will move between worlds,

701
01:13:25,248 --> 01:13:26,584
just like them.

702
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:30,280
Go put the wrong things right.

703
01:14:49,595 --> 01:14:50,602
Hold this.

704
01:15:14,157 --> 01:15:15,286
Hmm.

705
01:17:10,438 --> 01:17:11,438
Marion.

706
01:17:14,772 --> 01:17:15,806
Vincent.

707
01:17:15,807 --> 01:17:17,012
<i>Is it true?</i>

708
01:17:17,910 --> 01:17:19,182
I'm afraid so.

709
01:17:19,183 --> 01:17:20,246
He was killed.

710
01:17:20,912 --> 01:17:21,984
<i>Are you sure?</i>

711
01:17:22,715 --> 01:17:24,085
I'm sorry.

712
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:29,519
Damn.

713
01:18:01,493 --> 01:18:02,791
<i>Please can we ask you</i>

714
01:18:02,792 --> 01:18:04,829
<i>to make your way
to your seats. Thank you.</i>

715
01:18:05,493 --> 01:18:06,923
Stefan?

716
01:18:06,924 --> 01:18:08,525
Front entrance secure.

717
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:02,848
Hey!

718
01:20:27,838 --> 01:20:29,072
<i>We have a situation.</i>

719
01:20:30,308 --> 01:20:31,701
He's here.

720
01:23:48,102 --> 01:23:49,937
He's here.

721
01:23:49,938 --> 01:23:51,967
<i>He's killing all of our people.</i>

722
01:23:55,605 --> 01:23:57,448
I'm so grateful to you, Marion.

723
01:23:57,449 --> 01:23:58,644
For what? Wh...

724
01:24:00,051 --> 01:24:01,416
<i>For getting us this far.</i>

725
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:06,516
That's all you're going to say?

726
01:24:06,517 --> 01:24:08,619
We're on this ride
together, Marion.

727
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:10,722
You just happen
to be in the front.

728
01:25:15,528 --> 01:25:16,528
Where is he?

729
01:25:17,091 --> 01:25:18,262
He's not in here.

730
01:25:21,358 --> 01:25:22,731
Where is he?

731
01:25:22,732 --> 01:25:23,795
He's...

732
01:25:28,265 --> 01:25:29,735
His country estate.

733
01:25:30,544 --> 01:25:31,605
Hillhurst Manor.

734
01:25:44,658 --> 01:25:46,158
You fucking killed us.

735
01:25:46,922 --> 01:25:47,984
For what?

736
01:25:48,595 --> 01:25:49,689
Was it worth it?

737
01:26:02,104 --> 01:26:04,132
It starts off so small.

738
01:26:06,273 --> 01:26:08,102
It's all kept from you.

739
01:26:08,103 --> 01:26:11,276
You know what's being done,
but you're not part of it.

740
01:26:11,277 --> 01:26:13,077
And then, just like that,

741
01:26:13,078 --> 01:26:14,109
you are.

742
01:26:15,953 --> 01:26:17,354
You're swallowed up.

743
01:26:18,516 --> 01:26:19,766
And the only direction

744
01:26:19,767 --> 01:26:21,017
you can go is down.

745
01:26:27,097 --> 01:26:29,062
You have the same look as him.

746
01:26:29,063 --> 01:26:30,829
What look is that?

747
01:26:30,830 --> 01:26:34,129
The look of someone who hates
everything inside of him.

748
01:26:36,272 --> 01:26:38,758
He just hides it
better than you.

Who are you?

778
01:31:30,462 --> 01:31:31,932
Just an old man...

779
01:31:34,666 --> 01:31:36,167
but I'm real.

780
01:31:45,147 --> 01:31:46,477
See?

781
01:31:46,478 --> 01:31:48,047
I'm flesh and blood.

782
01:31:49,153 --> 01:31:50,379
Not like you.

783
01:31:55,791 --> 01:31:57,562
I heard you think
you can bring her back.

784
01:31:58,656 --> 01:31:59,993
You can't.

785
01:32:01,534 --> 01:32:05,361
Where she is,
you don't come back from that.

786
01:32:09,373 --> 01:32:12,236
That video, did you see it?

787
01:32:14,046 --> 01:32:16,511
I know, I'm sorry.

788
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:18,081
She's not what
you thought she was.

789
01:32:18,082 --> 01:32:19,481
No, it wasn't her.

790
01:32:22,152 --> 01:32:23,247
It was you.

791
01:32:25,157 --> 01:32:26,280
You corrupt people.

792
01:32:26,281 --> 01:32:28,488
You can't corrupt
what's not already there.

793
01:32:28,489 --> 01:32:31,222
A pearl. It's a seed.

794
01:32:32,228 --> 01:32:33,228
Hmm.

795
01:32:37,234 --> 01:32:38,262
Look at yourself.

796
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:43,267
Look at what you've become.

797
01:32:45,472 --> 01:32:46,776
Those eyes.

798
01:32:50,015 --> 01:32:51,110
That face.

799
01:32:54,321 --> 01:32:57,302
Why would she want
to be with you?

800
01:32:57,303 --> 01:33:00,284
You have no love left.
Only hate.

801
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:03,254
You fool.

802
01:33:15,768 --> 01:33:17,202
You don't feel anything.

803
01:33:18,576 --> 01:33:20,403
Do you?
You don't feel any of it.

804
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:24,374
I feel it all.

805
01:33:49,734 --> 01:33:50,869
<i>Say something!</i>

806
01:33:50,870 --> 01:33:52,470
- Wake the fuck up.

807
01:33:57,206 --> 01:33:58,906
<i>You have no love left.</i>

808
01:33:58,907 --> 01:34:00,381
<i>Only hate.</i>

809
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:06,957
<i>She's not what
you thought she was.</i>

810
01:34:21,235 --> 01:34:23,701
<i>When I'm hard to love,
love me harder.</i>

811
01:34:23,702 --> 01:34:25,105
<i>Love me harder.</i>

812
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:29,010
<i>How many people have you loved?</i>

813
01:34:30,076 --> 01:34:33,476
<i>Like seriously,
seriously loved?</i>

814
01:34:34,747 --> 01:34:36,319
<i>Don't leave me.</i>

815
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:42,694
<i>I don't want it to end.</i>

816
01:35:23,236 --> 01:35:24,395
What is this place?

817
01:35:25,836 --> 01:35:28,536
This is the place
where it all ends.

818
01:35:28,537 --> 01:35:31,237
Where you pay
for what you did to her...

819
01:35:33,344 --> 01:35:34,638
to all of them.

820
01:35:42,683 --> 01:35:43,920
Are you scared?

821
01:35:45,257 --> 01:35:46,582
You should be.

822
01:35:50,227 --> 01:35:51,825
Oh, you stupid boy.

823
01:35:51,826 --> 01:35:53,424
Is this what you want?

824
01:35:54,334 --> 01:35:55,459
You think she's worth it?

825
01:35:56,597 --> 01:35:57,802
All this?

826
01:35:58,699 --> 01:35:59,936
Eternal hell?

827
01:36:01,338 --> 01:36:02,367
For what?

828
01:36:03,837 --> 01:36:05,535
For some fucking whore?

829
01:36:34,365 --> 01:36:36,030
You have no idea
what hell awaits you.

830
01:36:36,031 --> 01:36:38,007
Yeah, I do.

831
01:37:55,948 --> 01:37:57,486
Eric.

832
01:37:57,487 --> 01:37:59,748
I had this terrible dream.

833
01:38:00,359 --> 01:38:01,849
I was falling.

834
01:38:03,121 --> 01:38:04,522
I thought I'd lost you.

835
01:38:05,189 --> 01:38:06,854
It's okay, baby.

836
01:38:07,728 --> 01:38:08,900
It's over.

837
01:38:10,028 --> 01:38:11,397
It's all over.

838
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:17,007
You get to go back.

839
01:38:27,516 --> 01:38:28,546
Eric...

840
01:38:30,852 --> 01:38:31,879
what have you done?

841
01:38:34,493 --> 01:38:36,290
I can't come with you.

842
01:38:38,758 --> 01:38:39,788
What?

843
01:38:40,895 --> 01:38:42,895
This was the only way.

844
01:38:45,237 --> 01:38:46,237
No.

845
01:38:47,099 --> 01:38:49,201
I'm going with you.

846
01:38:49,202 --> 01:38:52,068
This isn't the way
it was supposed to end.

847
01:38:52,069 --> 01:38:53,571
I would do it again.

848
01:38:55,204 --> 01:38:56,370
All of it.

849
01:38:56,371 --> 01:38:57,536
Every moment.

850
01:39:02,354 --> 01:39:03,449
I love you.

851
01:39:04,190 --> 01:39:05,319
Forever.

852
01:39:19,031 --> 01:39:20,368
Do you hear me?

853
01:39:20,369 --> 01:39:21,435
Yes.

854
01:39:21,436 --> 01:39:22,732
It's okay.

855
01:39:32,584 --> 01:39:34,108
