it was on the house.

the mirror?

when someone dies.

554
00:47:34,605 --> 00:47:36,037
You cover the mirror,

555
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:37,906
so the deceased
doesn't see their reflection

556
00:47:37,908 --> 00:47:39,375
and become a ghost.

00:47:40,144 --> 00:47:41,743

558
00:47:41,745 --> 00:47:45,481

can you tell me about
the history of this abbey?

603
00:50:37,514 --> 00:50:40,016
It was built by a duke
in the Dark Ages.

604
00:50:42,252 --> 00:50:44,585
<i>The Duke of Saint Carta.</i>

605
00:50:44,587 --> 00:50:48,189
<i>He wrote countless texts
on witchcraft and rituals,</i>

606
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:51,426
in which to call upon
the forces of hell.

607
00:50:51,428 --> 00:50:54,228
Hell used him
to open a gateway

608
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:55,629
so that an unspeakable evil

609
00:50:55,631 --> 00:50:57,200
<i>would walk amongst us.</i>

610

(RUMBLING)

611
00:51:12,081 --> 00:51:14,116
<i>But the Church
stormed the castle.</i>

612
00:51:19,154 --> 00:51:23,622
They sealed the gateway
using an ancient relic

613
00:51:23,624 --> 00:51:26,128
<i>containing the blood
of Jesus Christ.</i>

614
00:51:30,798 --> 00:51:32,965
<i>The Church claimed the castle
for their own</i>

615
00:51:32,967 --> 00:51:34,900
<i>and our perpetual
praying began</i>

616
00:51:34,902 --> 00:51:37,870
<i>to secure the abbey
and contain the evil.</i>

617
00:51:37,872 --> 00:51:42,742
<i>For centuries it worked
and evil was kept at bay</i>

618

<i>until the bombs of war
shook the abbey</i>

619
00:51:46,381 --> 00:51:50,648
and evil found another way
to open the gateway.

620
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:54,686
Sister Oana,
last night in the chapel,

621
00:51:54,688 --> 00:51:55,889
I saw a nun.

622
00:51:57,258 --> 00:52:02,529
She was...
She felt anything but holy.

623
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:04,865
Do you see her, too?

624
00:52:06,233 --> 00:52:09,334
I've seen her stalking
the hallways at night.

625
00:52:09,336 --> 00:52:11,302
<i>We all have.</i>

626
00:52:11,304 --> 00:52:14,305
<i>She looks like us,
but she's not one of us.</i>

627
00:52:14,307 --> 00:52:15,907
It's something unholy.

628
00:52:15,909 --> 00:52:18,009
It takes on different forms
to deceive us

629
00:52:18,011 --> 00:52:19,610
and prey on our weaknesses.

630
00:52:19,612 --> 00:52:21,912
It appears as a nun so it can
hide among our cloister

631
00:52:21,914 --> 00:52:24,149
<i>until it can corrupt us all.</i>

632
00:52:24,151 --> 00:52:27,951
I fear her presence means
the portal has opened again.

633
00:52:27,953 --> 00:52:30,288
It made Sister Victoria
commit the ultimate sin.

634
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:31,624
SISTER ABIGAIL: Sister Oana.

635
00:52:34,994 --> 00:52:37,630

643
